      "With remarkable regularity, Anderson has been crafting movies uniquely his own since his 1996 debut, \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201d",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Wes Anderson isn\u2019t driving the bus. Laurent is. That\u2019s the name of the driver who\u2019s bringing Anderson, and his bus, to the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "As they drive from his home in Paris to the South of France, Anderson explains by phone: \u201cI don\u2019t drive the bus. You have to have, like, four years of training and an EU bus driver\u2019s license. The thing is, if you\u2019re going to drive a bus like this, you\u2019ve got to be able to drive it in reverse, too.\u201d",
      "For years, Anderson has, in favor of the normal festival cars that shuttle guests, brought his own bus to Cannes so his whole cast can arrive together at the premiere. On Sunday, Anderson and company (including Benicio del Toro, Mia Threapleton, Michael Cera, Scarlett Johansson and Bryan Cranston) will pile in for the premiere of Anderson\u2019s latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s another example of how Anderson has made something quite unusual into a regular tradition.",
      "With remarkable regularity, Anderson has been crafting movies uniquely his own since his 1996 debut, \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201d There are variations. Some are expansive family dramas (\"The Royal Tenenbaums\"). Some are more intimate (\"Rushmore\"). Some are more densely layered (\"Asteroid City\").",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d a leaner tale which Focus Features will release May 30, is Anderson working in high comic gear. A playful and poignant kind of thriller, it stars Del Toro as the tycoon Zsa-Zsa Korda, who decides to name his daughter, a novitiate (Threapleton) heir to his dubiously accrued fortune.",
      "The wheels keep turning for the 56-year-old Anderson. But there are signs of time passing, too. The Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Paris is hosting an Anderson retrospective, as well as an exhibition of props, costumes and artifacts from his expansive personal archive.",
      "Anderson, who has a 9-year-old daughter with his wife, the costume designer Juman Malouf, spoke about those things and others on his way to Cannes to unveil \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\" a movie that adds yet another fitting mantra to the world of Wes: \u201cWhat matters is the sincerity of your devotion.\u201d",
      "ANDERSON: We\u2019ve been keeping this stuff for so long. The experience of doing it was kind of great. I\u2019d sort of get pulled over there to approve things. And my reaction was, \u201cWell, we have more stuff.\u201d So we kept adding things. My daughter has lived with a lot of this stuff. The \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d puppets have been in our apartment in New York ever since we made the movie in boxes. Over the years, she takes them out and plays with them.",
      "ANDERSON: (Laughs) Jason, and Bill, have a way of catching you off guard with a turn of phrase. But I like that description. It\u2019s kind of an amazing experience to have had Jason involved in our movies for so long given that he was 17 when I met him. It\u2019s fun and a strange feeling. The decades have to elapse for you to have had that much time together. And it\u2019s quite shocking that they do. But there it is.",
      "ANDERSON: I didn\u2019t have something I thought I wanted to communicate about what it\u2019s like to be a father. The story really come out of an idea for Benicio and for this character. But I don\u2019t think he would have had a daughter if I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s my hunch. He\u2019s a special kind of a father, in all the worst ways. But nevertheless, there\u2019s something we related to. That\u2019s probably somewhere in the DNA of the movie.",
      "ANDERSON: If I were to say what is the first idea of the movie, it is that face. It\u2019s not an image of the setting, it\u2019s an image of Benicio in a close-up as this character. His face is just so expressive and interesting. It\u2019s a special advantage he has. He\u2019s quite mesmerizing just looking at him on camera, his chemistry with the exposure of film. In \u201cThe French Dispatch,\u201d there were electric moments on the set. But the electricity was amplified when we went back into the cutting room. The wheels started turning. When we showed \u201cThe French Dispatch\u201d however many years ago in Cannes, I did mention to Benicio there, \u201cJust be aware, there\u2019s something else coming.\"",
      "ANDERSON: Essentially, you\u2019ve put your finger on the movies that were written for a specific actor, along with Jason in \u201cAsteroid City.\u201d Owen and I were talking about Gene Hackman by the time we had 10 pages of a script. Ralph was the idea for the character in \u201cGrand Budapest\u201d before there was even one page. But I never had one where I thought of someone in such a tight close-up. With this movie, somehow it\u2019s the face and the eyes and the closest close-up.",
      "ANDERSON: First of all, Gene Hackman, one of the greatest movie actors ever. He did enjoy the movie, I think, between action and cut. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s when I have a good time.\u201d But he really didn\u2019t enjoy the parts in between, which is most of the time. He wasn\u2019t wildly taken with the script in the first place. I don\u2019t think he loved the idea of being that guy. I think he thought: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I don\u2019t like about this man and I\u2019m not sure I want to live as him.\u201d",
      "Also, I was very young. He was shy and reserved, though he could also get quite explosive. We didn\u2019t know each other well. Sometimes, when we had conflict, we often had open conversations about what just happened. And I felt like I learned so much about him in those times. And he would often become much more gentle.",
      "I don\u2019t want to assume a great friendship because I don\u2019t think he would have ever have referred to our relationship (laughs) in those terms. But I really liked him. He just carried so much tension and he used in the work, but it was sometimes bordering on a little abusive, especially to me. (Laughs)",
      "ANDERSON: I think that\u2019s the case sometimes. When he saw the movie, he told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what we were making.\u201d But he totally understood it when he saw the movie. It worked for him. He liked it, and I think he liked what he had done it. I later thought: I wish I had paused for three days of shooting, edited some of the scenes carefully and then shown him: Here\u2019s what you\u2019re doing and here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I think maybe if I had done that, we might have had a gentler time.",
      "ANDERSON: The path that I\u2019ve had as a movie director, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s totally available right now. I don\u2019t know if the kind of movies I started out making would have been made on the same scale or with the same support or with any audience available. To get to the point where I can make the movies I make I now, I just don\u2019t know what route that would take. I think some things have changed fundamentally. But I\u2019m not 25 years younger than myself, so I just do what I do.",

      "Miami police confirmed in a written statement that officers responded to the area at about 3 a.m. after receiving an alert from the gunshot-detection system ShotSpotter. Officer Kiara Delva, a department spokeswoman, said police questioned several people but made no arrests. No injuries were reported at the scene.",
      "The investigation continues, Delva said, and she could not confirm the names of anyone involved.",
      "Video posted to social media showed Brown involved in a fight with several people at the boxing event, which was hosted by popular streamer Adin Ross. He was seen apparently holding a black pistol as he pursued someone. Shots could be heard off camera shortly thereafter.",
      "Additional video showed Brown, hands behind his back, being escorted from the venue by an officer.",
      "Brown posted on social media that he had been \u201cjumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me.\"",
      "\"Police temporarily detained me until they received my side of the story and then released me. I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT AND WAS NOT ARRESTED,\u201d Brown wrote.",
      "Brown's statement did not mention the gunshots.",
      "Brown played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010 to 2018, where he emerged as one of the NFL\u2019s top receiving threats and twice led the league in receiving yards. His career took a downturn because of various on- and off-field issues, including his contract being voided by the Oakland Raiders before the start of the 2019 season.",
      "He split his final three NFL seasons with New England and Tampa Bay, and his career ended with Brown stripping off his jersey, pads and gloves, while walking off the field during the Buccaneers\u2019 2021 regular-season finale against the New York Jets. Brown announced his retirement a few months later.",

      "A trio singing for Sweden about the joys of saunas and a classically trained Austrian countertenor are among those tipped to take the microphone-shaped Eurovision trophy at the contest in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "But at the ever-unpredictable event, the prize could just as easily go to powerful singers from France, the Netherlands or Finland \u2014 or even an Estonian who sings about Italian coffee. The final kicks off at 9 p.m. local time.",
      "Bookmakers say the favorite is KAJ, representing Sweden with their ode to sauna culture \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d followed by Austrian singer JJ\u2019s pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love.\u201d",

      "Movies are a regular presence in author Kazuo Ishiguro's life in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Kazuo Ishiguro 's mother was in Nagasaki when the atomic bomb was dropped.",
      "When Ishiguro, the Nobel laureate and author of \u201cRemains of the Day\u201d and \u201cNever Let Me Go,\u201d first undertook fiction writing in his 20s, his first novel, 1982's \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d was inspired by his mother's stories, and his own distance from them. Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki but, when he was 5, moved to England with his family.",
      "\u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d marked the start to what's become one of the most lauded writing careers in contemporary literature. And, now, like most of Ishiguro's other novels, it's a movie, too.",
      "Kei Ishikawa's film by the same name premiered Thursday at the Cannes Film Festival in its Un Certain Regard section. The 70-year-old author has been here before; he was a member of the jury in 1994 that gave \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d the Palme d'Or. \u201cAt the time it was a surprise decision,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people booed.\u201d",
      "Ishiguro is a movie watcher and sometimes maker, too. He penned the 2022 Akira Kurosawa adaptation \u201cLiving.\u201d Movies are a regular presence in his life, in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them. Taika Waititi is currently finishing a film of Ishiguro's most recent novel, \u201cKlara and the Sun\u201d (2021).",
      "Ishiguro likes to participate in early development of an adaptation, and then disappear, letting the filmmaker take over. Seeing \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d turned into an elegant, thoughtful drama is especially meaningful to him because the book, itself, deals with inheritance, and because it represents his beginning as a writer.",
      "\u201cThere was no sense that anyone else was going to reread this thing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo in that sense, it\u2019s different to, say, the movie of \u2018Remains of the Day\u2019 or the movie of \u2018Never Let Me Go.\u2019\u201d",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited.",
      "ISHIGURO: Often people think I\u2019m being unduly modest when I say I want the film to be different to the book. I don\u2019t want it to be wildly different. But in order for the film to live, there has to be a reason why it\u2019s being made then, for the audience at that moment. Not 25 years ago, or 45 years ago, as in the case of this book. It has to be a personal artistic expression of something, not just a reproduction. Otherwise, it can end up like a tribute or an Elvis impersonation.",
      "Whenever I see adaptations of books not work, it\u2019s always because it\u2019s been too reverential. Sometimes it\u2019s laziness. People think: Everything is there in the book. The imagination isn\u2019t pushed to work. For every one of these things that\u2019s made it to the screen, there\u2019s been 10, 15 developments that I\u2019ve been personally involved with that fell by the wayside. I always try to get people to just move it on.",
      "ISHIGURO: You can take two kind of approaches. You write a novel and that\u2019s the discrete, perfect thing. Other people can pay homage to it but basically that\u2019s it. Or you can take another view that stories are things that just get passed around, down generations. Even though you think you wrote an original story, you\u2019ve put it together out of other stuff that\u2019s come before you. So it\u2019s part of that tradition.",
      "I said Homer but it could be folktales. The great stories are the ones that last and last and last. They turn up in different forms. It\u2019s because people can change and adapt them to their times and their culture that these stories are valuable. There was a time when people would sit around a fire and just tell each other these stories. You sit down with some anticipation: This guy is going to tell it in a slightly different way. What\u2019s he going to do? It\u2019s like if Keith Jarrett sits down and says he\u2019s going to play \u201cNight and Day.\u201d So when you go from book to film, that\u2019s a fireside moment. That way it has a chance of lasting, and I have a chance of turning into Homer.",
      "ISHIGURO: I\u2019ve got a few centuries to go.",
      "ISHIGURO: I was between the age of 24 and 26. It was published when I was 27. I remember the circumstances very vividly. I can even remember writing a lot of those scenes. My wife, Lorna, was my girlfriend back then. We were both postgraduate students. I wrote it on a table about this size, which was also where we would have our meals. When she came in at the end of the day, I had to pack up even if I was at the crucial point of some scene. It was no big deal. I was just doing something indulgent. There was no real sense I had a career or it would get published. So it\u2019s strange all these years later that she and I are here and attended this premiere in Cannes.",
      "ISHIGURO: I think that\u2019s really insightful what you just said. There is a limit to how much understanding there can be between generations. What\u2019s needed is a certain amount of generosity on both sides, to respect each other\u2019s generations and the difference in values. I think an understanding that the world was a really complicated place, and that often individuals can\u2019t hope to have perspective on the forces that are playing on them at the time. To actually understand that needs a generosity.",
      "ISHIGURO: I wasn\u2019t like a journalist trying to get stuff out of my mother. There's part of me that was quite reluctant to hear this stuff. On some level it was kind of embarrassing to think of my mother in such extreme circumstances. A lot of the things she told me weren\u2019t to do with the atomic bomb. Those weren\u2019t her most traumatic memories.",
      "My mother was a great oral storyteller. She would sometimes have a lunch date and do a whole version of a Shakespeare play by herself. That was my introduction to \u201cHamlet\u201d or things like that. She was keen to tell me but also wary of telling me. It was always a fraught thing. Having something formal \u2014 \u201cOh, I\u2019m becoming a writer, I\u2019m going to write up something so these memories can be preserved\u201d \u2014 that made it easier.",
      "ISHIGURO: Someone said to me the other day, \u201cWe live in a time now where a lot of people would sympathize with the older, what you might call fascist views.\u201d It\u2019s not expressed overtly; the older teacher is saying it's tradition and patriotism.",
      "Now, maybe we live in a world where that\u2019s a good point, and that hadn\u2019t occurred to me. It\u2019s an example of: Yes, we write in a bubble and make movies in a kind of a bubble. But the power of stories is they have to go into different values.",
      "This question of how you pass stories on, this is one of the big challenges. You have to reexamine every scene. Some things that might have been a very safe assumption only a few years ago would not be because the value systems are changing around our books and films just as much as they\u2019re changing around us.",

With so many films packed into the 12-day festival, and with much of the world watching, there are high stakes to standing out in Cannes.",
      "But in recent years, the Cannes marketing stunt has turned into an endangered species. Hopes that Tom Cruise might revive a dormant tradition passed with the relatively sedate premiere Wednesday of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning.\u201d",
      "Would Cruise parachute into the Palais? Could he ride an airplane wing to the premiere? Nothing so elaborate came to pass. Cruise and company walked the red carpet while serenaded by an orchestra playing the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme.",
      "Along the Croisette this year, there's a noticeable lack of the kind of grand advertisements Hollywood has often trotted out for the festival. Paramount Pictures has a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d installation outside the Carlton Hotel, but \u2014 as has been true for several years \u2014 Hollywood rarely still seeks to make big marketing splashes in Cannes.",
      "Even though Universal Pictures' upcoming Formula One action drama \u201cF1\u201d might seem like a natural fit, with the Monaco Grand Prix just days away, \u201cF1\u201d \u2014 at least so far \u2014 has made no pit stop in Cannes.",
      "Things could change. Cannes runs until May 24. Someone might yet arrive by parasail over the Mediterranean, as T.J. Miller did in 2017 for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d or do ninja kicks with a troupe of giant pandas, as Jack Black did in 2008 for \u201cKung Fu Panda.\u201d",
      "But for years, the circus-like quality of Cannes has been in decline. That's owed partly to budgetary constraints and shifting marketing priorities for major studios. For Cruise and \u201cFinal Reckoning,\u201d Cannes was just one stop on a worldwide tour.",
      "Plus, some of those who were most devoted to bringing Hollywood entertainment to Cannes are no longer regulars here. While head of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg made sure his films left a mark in Cannes, whether with models wearing \u201cTrolls\u201d wigs or Seinfeld's \u201cBee Movie\u201d zip line.",
      "Is the absence of such things anything to lament? Probably not, but they did add to the crazy-things-will-happen nature of Cannes, giving the festival the feel of big tent extravaganza. It could be counted as one small, superficial way that movies aren't quite the carnivalesque show they once were.",
      "For now, though, we can say we'll always have when Sacha Baron Cohen, for \u201cThe Dictator,\u201d rode a camel down the Croisette. Ah, the memories.",

      "For powerful men in France\u2019s film industry, this was a week of reckoning",
      "PARIS -- For powerful men in France\u2019s film industry, this was a week of reckoning.",
      "G\u00e9rard Depardieu \u2014 the country\u2019s most famous actor \u2014 was convicted of sexual assault. Two days later, the Cannes Film Festival barred another actor accused of rape from walking the red carpet.",
      "Together, the decisions sent a message France had long resisted: that artistic brilliance may no longer shield those who abuse their power.",
      "For decades, Depardieu was revered as French cinema\u2019s \u201csacred monster\u201d \u2014 a towering talent whose gluttony, volatility, and magnetism became part of his myth. With more than 250 films to his name, many believed he would remain untouchable even after more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.",
      "Now, that myth has cracked. The verdict has revived a broader question France has ducked since the dawn of #MeToo: Can a country that celebrates seduction and irreverence finally hold its male icons to account?",
      "France has long lived its own #MeToo contradiction with a long-held belief in \u201cl\u2019exception culturelle.\u201d That talent, charm, or intellect forgives misconduct and the art excuses the artist. Catherine Deneuve has defended \u201cthe freedom to bother,\" while Brigitte Bardot has dismissed feminism outright: \u201cFeminism isn\u2019t my thing. I like men.\u201d",
      "But the ground is shifting \u2014 fast.",
      "Depardieu was handed an 18-month suspended sentence Tuesday for groping two women on a 2021 film set. He denies the charges and is appealing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of impunity of artists with a capital A,\u201d Carine Durrieu Diebolt, a lawyer for one of the two women who won their case against Depardieu, told The Associated Press. The verdict represented \u201ca bookend for putting actors on a pedestal because they were talented,\u201d she added.",
      "Two days later, the prestigious Cannes Film Festival barred actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy \u2014 accused of rape by three former partners \u2014 from attending the premiere of a film he stars in. Though the file was dropped for lack of evidence, the women are relaunching their case as a civil complaint.",
      "Navarro-Mussy denies wrongdoing. His lawyer said she\u2019s unaware of any ongoing proceedings against him.",
      "What stunned wasn\u2019t just the decision, but who made it. Cannes director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux had long been seen as emblematic of the old guard. He defended Roman Polanski for years and continued to screen his films despite the director\u2019s 1977 guilty plea in the U.S. for sex with a 13-year-old. In 2018, when asked why Cannes still included Polanski, Fr\u00e9maux said: \u201cThese are complicated matters.\u201d",
      "Fr\u00e9maux opened 2023's festival with a film starring Johnny Depp, despite the actor\u2019s highly public legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard over allegations of domestic abuse, in which he was never criminally charged. When asked about the backlash, Fr\u00e9maux replied: \u201cI only have one rule: it\u2019s the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.\u201d",
      "This week, the rules changed.",
      "\u201cThe Cannes decision is of course linked to the Depardieu verdict,\u201d said C\u00e9line Piques of Osez le f\u00e9minisme (\u201cDare Feminism!\u201d), a group that campaigns against sexual violence. \u201c(They\u2019ve) realized which way the wind is blowing. Fr\u00e9maux is trying to right the wrongs.\u201d",
      "Not everyone welcomed the verdict \u2014 or what followed \u2014 as a cultural turning point.",
      "Fanny Ardant, one of French cinema\u2019s grandes dames and a longtime friend of Depardieu, sat on his side in court. She is now directing him in a film in Portugal, despite the conviction.",
      "\u201cFanny Ardant? She completely missed the point,\u201d said Piques. \u201cShe downplayed the violence, normalized it. That\u2019s rape culture, plain and simple.\u201d",
      "Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president and one of France\u2019s most respected actresses, struck a note of restraint: \u201cHe\u2019s not a monster. He\u2019s a man \u2014 one who has, apparently, been desacralized.\u201d",
      "In 2024, more than 22,000 rapes were reported in France. Fewer than 3% led to convictions. \u201cThe Depardieu verdict shows there\u2019s progress,\u201d said lawyer Anne-Sophie Laguens, who works with victims of sexual assault. \u201cBut for most women, the barriers to justice remain enormous.\u201d",
      "When Bertrand Cantat \u2014 frontman of Noir D\u00e9sir and once one of France\u2019s bestselling rock singers \u2014 launched a 2018 comeback tour, he had served just four years in prison for killing his partner, actress Marie Trintignant, during a violent assault.",
      "Despite public outrage, he returned to the stage and performed.",
      "\u201cThat would be unthinkable today,\u201d said Piques. \u201cThe public mood has changed. What we tolerate has changed.\u201d",
      "One breakthrough came not in cinema, but in a Bordeaux courtroom. The conviction of 51 men for drugging and raping Gisele Pelicot \u2014 a case long ignored despite her pleas \u2014 marked a turning point. For years, shame was hers. Now, it belongs to the perpetrators.",
      "\u201cIt proved rapists aren\u2019t just strangers in alleys,\u201d said Piques. \u201cThey\u2019re husbands. Colleagues. Respected men.\u201d",
      "Other recent convictions in entertainment included director Christophe Ruggia, who was convicted of abusing actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was a minor, though he is appealing; and actor-director Nicolas Bedos, who was sentenced for sexual assault.",
      "Slowly but surely, yes. The system that long protected men like Depardieu is not yet dismantled, but it is shifting.",
      "As one of the actor\u2019s accusers said through tears after the ruling: \u201cI\u2019m very, very much satisfied with the decision. That\u2019s a victory for me, really. And a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.\u201d",

      "The 69th Eurovision Song Contest is approaching its grand final in the Swiss city of Basel",
      "BASEL, Switzerland -- There has already been triumph and tears, singing onstage and in the streets, and a touch of political division, as the 69th Eurovision Song Contest approaches its grand final in the Swiss city of Basel.",
      "Musical acts from 26 countries will take the stage at the St. Jakobshalle arena on Saturday in a spectacular, sequin-drenched competition that has been uniting and dividing Europeans since 1956.",
      "Here\u2019s everything to know:",
      "Eurovision is competition in which performers from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete under their national flags with the aim of being crowned continental champion. Think of it as the Olympics of pop music or the World Cup with singing instead of soccer.",
      "It\u2019s a celebration of silly fun and music\u2019s unifying power, but also a place where politics and regional rivalries play out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s biggest cultural event,\u201d said Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision. \u201cIt has been going on for almost 70 years and people love to watch it, not only for the show, for the glitter, the stage effects, the crazy costumes, but also because they like to see it as a reflection of the zeitgeist in Europe.\u201d",
      "Of 37 countries that sent performers to Eurovision, 11 were knocked out by public voting in semifinals on Tuesday and Thursday. Another six automatically qualified for the final: the host, Switzerland, and the \u201cBig Five\u201d that pay the most to the contest \u2014 France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.",
      "The 26 countries competing Saturday, in order of performance, are: Norway, Luxembourg, Estonia, Israel, Lithuania, Spain, Ukraine, the U.K, Austria, Iceland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Poland, Germany, Greece, Armenia, Switzerland, Malta, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, France, San Marino and Albania.",
      "Favorites, according to oddsmakers, are KAJ, representing Sweden with \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a jaunty serenade to the sauna. Dutch singer Claude is also highly rated with soulful ballad \u201cC\u2019est La Vie.\u201d Other favorites include classically trained Austrian countertenor JJ with his pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love,\u201d and Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise.\u201d",
      "Eurovision has a reputation for campy europop with nonsense lyrics \u2014 past winners include \u201cLa, La, La\u201d and \u201cBoom Bang-a-Bang.\u201d But It has also produced some enduring pop classics. And it helped make stars of performers including ABBA \u2014 winners in 1974 with \u201cWaterloo\u201d \u2014 Celine Dion, Austrian drag performer Conchita Wurst and Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin.",
      "This year\u2019s finalists range from Lithuanian emo rockers Katarsis to a power ballad Spanish diva Melody and Ukrainian prog rockers Ziferblat.",
      "Campiness, humor and double entendres abound. \u201cEspresso Macchiato\u201d is a comic ode to Italian stereotypes performed by Estonia\u2019s Tommy Cash. Miriana Conte sings for Malta with the double entendre-filled \u201cServing\u201d -- performed on a set including a glitter ball and giant lips, it is classic Eurovision.",
      "It was once widely accepted that the most successful Eurovision songs were in English, but that is changing. This year\u2019s contest features songs in a record 20 languages, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Latvian, Maltese and Armenian.",
      "Vuletic said viewers these days want \u201cmore authenticity in Eurovision entries.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t just want a standard pop song sung in English,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to also see something about the culture of the country that the song represents.\u201d",
      "Once all the acts have performed in the final, the winner is chosen by a famously complex mix of phone and online voters from around the world and rankings by music-industry juries in each of the Eurovision countries. As the results are announced, countries slide up and down the rankings and tensions build.",
      "Ending up with \u201cnul points,\u201d or zero, is considered a national humiliation.",
      "The final starts Saturday at 1900 GMT (3 p.m. EDT) and will be aired by national broadcasters in participating nations, on streaming service Peacock in the United States and in many countries on the Eurovision YouTube channel.",
      "During and immediately after the final, viewers in participating countries can vote by phone, text message or the Eurovision app \u2014 but not for their own country. Viewers in the U.S. and other nonparticipating countries can vote all day Saturday, online at www.esc.vote or with the app. The combined \u201crest of the world\u201d vote is given the weight of one individual country.",
      "The contest\u2019s motto is \u201cunited by music,\u201d but the world\u2019s divisions inevitably intrude.",
      "Russia was banned from Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and since then Ukrainian musicians \u2014 including 2022 winner Kalush Orchestra \u2014 have competed under the shadow of war in the home country.",
      "This year\u2019s contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Dozens of former participants, including Nemo, have called for Israel to be excluded over its conduct in the war against Hamas in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden.",
      "A handful of protesters attempted to disrupt a rehearsal by Israeli singer Raphael on Thursday with oversized flags and whistles and were escorted from the arena. Organizers say they have tightened security ahead of the final.",

      "A jury found Hadi Matar, 27, guilty of attempted murder and assault in February.",
      "Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said he will request the maximum 25 years in prison for the Aug. 12, 2022, attack on Rushdie and seven years for injuring a second man who was on stage with the author. The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, he said.",
      "Rushdie is not expected to return to court for his assailant's sentencing, the prosecutor said. During the trial, the 77-year-old author was the key witness, describing how he believed he was dying when a masked attacker plunged a knife into his head and body more than a dozen times as he was being introduced at the Chautauqua Institution to speak about writer safety.",
      "Rushdie spent 17 days at a Pennsylvania hospital and more than three weeks at a New York City rehabilitation center. The author of \u201cMidnight's Children,\u201d \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Last Sigh\" and \u201cVictory City\u201d detailed his recovery in his 2024 memoir, \u201cKnife.\u201d",
      "Matar next faces a federal trial on terrorism-related charges. While the first trial focused mostly on the details of the knife attack itself, the next one is expected to delve into the more complicated issue of motive.",
      "Authorities said Matar, a U.S. citizen, was attempting to carry out a decades-old fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death when he traveled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target Rushdie at the summer retreat about 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo.",
      "Matar believed the fatwa, first issued in 1989, was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa after publication of Rushdie's novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. Rushdie spent years in hiding, but after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree he traveled freely over the past quarter century.",
      "Matar pleaded not guilty to a three-count indictment charging him with providing material to terrorists, attempting to provide material support to Hezbollah and engaging in terrorism transcending national boundaries.",
      "Video of the assault, captured by the venue's cameras and played at trial, show Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. As the audience gasps and screams, Rushdie is seen raising his arms and rising from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them.",
      "Jurors in Matar's first trial delivered their verdict after less than two hours of deliberation.",

      "The Weeknd's first feature film is a surrealist vanity project, writes Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman",
      "NEW YORK -- It's the final night of tour. SoFi Stadium, just outside Los Angeles, is packed. 80,000 fans stand before The Weeknd, an endless sea of blinding lights. The bestselling artist born Abel Tesfaye emerges onstage. He launches into the first song. Less than a minute goes by, and the unthinkable happens: His voice cracks. And then it is gone.",
      "That September night in 2022 marked a turning point for Tesfaye. He mines the scene in \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow, \u201d where, ironically, it arrives too late. The tedium of an incoherent first act paints the charismatic performer \u2014 one of the last few decades' most popular \u2014 as an unempathetic protagonist in a nonlinear and nonsensical world.",
      "But how much of The Weeknd is here, really? In his first leading role in a feature film, directed by Trey Edward Shults, Tesfaye plays a fictionalized version of himself, an insomniac musician (as made explicitly clear in the \u201cWake Me Up\u201d leitmotif, where he sings, \u201cSun is never rising / I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s day or night\u201d). He's marred by a recent breakup from an ex portrayed in a cruel voicemail message (\u201cI used to think you were a good person,\u201d she says) and a hedonistic lifestyle, instigated by his superficial friend-manager Lee, played Barry Keoghan.",
      "Shortly after Tesfaye loses his voice, a psychosomatic ailment, he meets superfan Amina, portrayed by Jenna Ortega. She offers temporary comfort and, in return, is afforded no agency. She exists for him. Soon, the uninspired horrors begin, culminating in what recalls the torture scene in \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d with less violence. Instead, Amina \u2014 when she is not weeping; I urge all viewers to keep a \u201ccry count\u201d and consider what feminist blogs might have to say \u2014 lip-syncs some of The Weeknd's biggest hits back to him, explaining that they're all about \u201cemptiness and heartbreak.\u201d Woven throughout is some conversation about absent fathers and fear of abandonment, with unearned delivery and first-draft acuity \u2014 something gesturing at depth without piercing the surface.",
      "According to press materials, Amina and Lee are not real people but representations of Tesfaye. She is meant to represent Tesfaye's disconnected, \u201cdeeper emotional self\u201d \u2014 and Lee, his public persona. That is not made explicitly clear in the film, except in a very generous reading of the ending. Subtext only works when there is context to back it up, otherwise, you are left with \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d: an exciting vanity project with surrealist imagination but stiff writing, no stakes, limited emotional weight and an unclear narrative.",
      "That won't be an issue for superfans, of course \u2014 those intimately familiar with The Weeknd's music and career. This film appears to be for them and Tesfaye, a producer, alone; they have the framework in which to enjoy the runtime. Considering that fandom is the dominant form of popular culture, it's not a bad business decision.",
      "And it's worked for him before. This is not Tesfaye\u2019s first foray into acting. Aside from his cameo in \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d he starred in HBO\u2019s 2023 series \u201cThe Idol. \u201d He co-created the show with Sam Levinson, a show that similarly presented unearned provocation. At the time, \u201cThe Idol\u201d received criticism for its sadomasochistic storytelling that emerged after a shift away from \u201cthe female perspective,\u201d allegedly a request from Tesfaye. It was not a clever or subversive show, nor was it really even about anything, but it did inspire conversation. It's easy to see how \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d may have similar effects.",
      "In a moment where autobiographical films about musicians are playful and creative \u2014 Pharrell Williams' Lego partnership \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d comes to mind, as does Robbie Williams' \u201c Better Man \u201d \u2014 \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d feels like a misstep for those outside The Weeknd's most devoted. Of course, the film does not identify as a biopic. But it could've benefited from less self-seriousness. And editing.",
      "But what about the music? \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d is connected to Tesfaye's latest album of the same name \u2014 and the final chapter in The Weeknd\u2019s record-breaking trilogy that began with 2020\u2019s \u201cAfter Hours\u201d and continued with 2022\u2019s \u201cDawn FM.\u201d The album, the quietest of the series, worked as an allegory on the trials of fame \u2014 a topic long covered by the most successful purveyors of pop. Retrospectively, it works best as a film's soundtrack than a stand-alone record, ambitious. Like the movie, it gestures at criticism of the celebrity-industrial complex without accomplishing it. It seems obvious, now, to learn that the movie predates the record.",
      "The film's strength far and away is its score, composed by Tesfaye with Daniel Lopatin (better known as the experimental electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never and for his \u201cGood Time\u201d and \u201cUncut Gems\u201d scores). It builds from Tesfaye's discography and morphs into something physical and psychedelic \u2014 at its most elated, dread-filled and clubby. It is so affecting, it almost distracts from moments of dizzying cinematography, with the films' penchant for spinning frames, zooms into upside skylines, blurred vision and erratic lights.",
      "Those tools feel better suited for a music video, the kind of sophisticated visual world Tesfaye has developed in his pop career. They elevate his euphoric, layered, evocative dance-pop, but they do not translate in this film.",
      "\u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d a Lionsgate release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, drug use, some bloody violence and brief nudity. Running time: 105 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- Three-time Tony Award-winner Charles Strouse, Broadway's industrious, master melody-maker who composed the music for such classic musical theater hits as \"Annie,\" \"Bye Bye Birdie\" and \"Applause,\" died Thursday. He was 96.",
      "Strouse died at his home in New York City, his family said through the publicity agency The Press Room.",
      "In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Strouse wrote more than a dozen Broadway musicals, as well as film scores and the song \"Those Were the Days,\" the theme song for the sitcom \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Strouse turned out such popular \u2014 and catchy \u2014 show tunes as \"Tomorrow,\" the optimistic anthem from \"Annie,\" and the equally cheerful \"Put on a Happy Face\" from \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" his first Broadway success.",
      "\"I work every day. Activity \u2014 it's a life force,\" the New York-born composer told The Associated Press during an interview on the eve of his 80th birthday in 2008. \"When you enjoy doing what you're doing, which I do very much, I have something to get up for.\"",
      "Deep into his 90s, he was visiting tours of his shows and meeting casts. Jenn Thompson, who appeared in the first \u201cAnnie\u201d as Pepper and directed a touring version of \u201cAnnie\u201d in 2024, recalls Strouse coming to auditions and shedding a tear when a young girl sang \u201cTomorrow.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was tearing up and he put his hand on mine,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd he leaned in to me and very quietly said, \u2018That was you. That used to be you.\u2019 And I thought I would die. I thought my heart would drop out of my shoes.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cHe\u2019s so gorgeously generous and kind. He has always been that way.\u201d",

      "Bono has a seaside villa that\u2019s a short trip away from Cannes",
      "CANNES, France -- Cannes is a short trip from Bono\u2019s seaside villa in Eze-sur-Mer. He bought it with The Edge in 1993, and considers himself grateful to a coastline that, he says, gave him a \u201cdelayed adolescence.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can tell you I\u2019ve slept on beaches close to here,\u201d Bono says with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up in the sun.\u201d",
      "But that doesn't mean the Cannes Film Festival is a particularly familiar experience for the U2 frontman. He\u2019s here to premiere the Apple TV+ documentary \u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d which captures his one-man stage show. Before coming, Bono\u2019s daughter, the actor Eve Hewson, gave him some advice.",
      "\u201cShe said: \u2018Just get over yourself and bring it,\u2019\" Bono said in an interview on a hotel off the Croisette. \"What do I have to bring? Bring yourself and your gratitude that you\u2019re a musician and they\u2019re allowing you into a festival that celebrates actors and storytellers of a different kind. I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll try to bring it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Besides, Cannes, he notes, was founded amid World War II as an alternative to then-Mussolini controlled Venice Film Festival. It was, he says, \u201cdesigned to find fascists.\u201d",
      "Shifts in geopolitical tectonics was much on Bono's mind. He has spent much of his activist life fighting for aid to Africa and combating HIV-AIDS. U.S. President Donald Trump's dismantling of USAID has reversed much of that.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s irrational is taking pleasure in the defacement of these institutions of mercy,\u201d Bono said.",
      "\u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d an Andrew Dominik-directed black-and-white film that begins streaming May 30, adapts the one-man stage show that, in turn, came from Bono's 2022 book, \u201cSurrender: 40 Songs, One Story.\u201d",
      "In the film, Bono is self-effacing and reflective, sifting through the formative influence of his father, U2's skyrocketing to fame and considering how ego and social work might be related. He calls it \u201cthe tall tales of a short rock star.\u201d And as was the case on a recent sunny afternoon in Cannes, Bono makes a captivating raconteur.",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "BONO: Well, that\u2019s right. Globalization did very well for the world\u2019s poor. That and increased aid levels brought a billion people out of extreme poverty and halved childhood morality \u2014 remarkable jumps for quality of life for human beings.",
      "But it\u2019s also fair to say certain communities really paid the price for that \u2014 here in Europe, in the United States. And I\u2019m not sure those communities were credited enough for weathering storms that globalization brought. So I understand how we got to this place, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the right place to be in.",
      "Nationalism is not what we need. We grew up in a very charged atmosphere in Ireland. It makes you suspicious of nationalism and those animal spirits that can be drummed up. This is me speaking about surrender, \u201cStories of Surrender,\u201d at a time when the world has never been closer to a world war in my lifetime. At first I think it looks absurd, a bit ridiculous \u2014 now that has never stopped me in the past \u2014 but I think it\u2019s OK to look ridiculous for these ideas. Like surrender, nonviolence, peace.",
      "BONO: The new pope, he does look like a pope. That\u2019s a good start. I just saw the other day his first piece and he was talking about stopping shouting, God might prefer whispers. I thought, \u201cOh, this could be interesting.\u201d I\u2019m more of a shouter myself. I come from punk rock. But I\u2019m learning to turn that shout into a whisper in this film to get to an intimacy.",
      "BONO: Well, the accuracy of the put-down \u2014 \u201cYou are a baritone who thinks he\u2019s a tenor\u201d \u2014 is so all encompassing. I was going to call the play \u201cThe Baritone Who Thinks He\u2019s a Tenor.\u201d He\u2019s on my mind because he\u2019s the reason I sing.",
      "It\u2019s a wound that will never close because after playing him on stage for all those nights \u2014 just by turning left or right \u2014 I always loved him but I started to really like him. He started to make me laugh. There was a gift, as well as the voice, that he left me. Would he forgive me for impersonating him in the Teatro di San Carlo, a sacred place for tenors, probably not. But here I am impersonating an actor, so.",
      "BONO: Mission creep. I knew I had to write the book. The play was so I didn\u2019t have to tour the book in normal promotional activity, that I could actually have fun with it and play all the different characters in my life. I thought it was really good fun. Then I realized: Oh, there\u2019s parts of you that people don\u2019t know about. We don\u2019t go to U2 shows for belly laughs. But that\u2019s a part of who I am, which is the mischief as well as the melancholy.",
      "Then you end up doing a play with a lot of cameras in the way. Enter Andrew Dominik and he taught me something that I didn\u2019t really understand but my daughter does: The camera really knows when you\u2019re lying. So if want to tell this story, you better get ready to take your armor off. You\u2019re going to feel naked in front of the whole school, but that\u2019s what it takes.",
      "BONO: Based on my behavior just in the past week, the answer to that question is probably: Must try harder. The pilgrim\u2019s lack of progress. I would say that I understand a little better where I came from and that where I end up depends on how I deal with that.",
      "I\u2019ve been calling it the hall of mirrors, when you try to figure out who you are and who\u2019s behind the face. Then you just see all these faces staring back at you, and they\u2019re all true. The real star of this movie is my dad. I sort of like him better than I like myself because humor has become so important to me. It\u2019s not like everything needs to be a belly laugh, but there\u2019s a freedom. People like me, we can sing about freedom. It\u2019s much better to be it.",
      "BONO: There\u2019s a minister from Albania who said something that really stuck with me. She said: If you have a chance to hope, it\u2019s a moral duty because most people don\u2019t. So, yes, I feel we\u2019ll figure our way out of this. This is a scary moment.",
      "I think acknowledging that we can lose all we\u2019ve gained is sobering but it may be course-changing. I just believe in people enough. I believe in Americans enough. I\u2019m an Irish person, I can\u2019t tell people how to vote.",
      "I can tell you that a million children dying because their life support systems were pulled out of the wall, with glee, that\u2019s not the America that I recognize or understand. You\u2019re on the front lines of Europe here. America came in and saved the day. Ironically, so did Russia. More people died from Russia fighting the Nazis than everybody else. Now they tread on their own sacred memories by treading on the Ukrainians who also died on the front lines. I think part of that is that history didn\u2019t acknowledge it.",
      "I believe there is integrity in the Russian people. They need to change their leader, in my view. I believe there is integrity in the Americans. They will figure it out. Who was it who said: If you give Americans the facts, they will eventually make the right choice. Right now, they\u2019re not getting the facts. Think of it: a 70% decline in HIV-AIDS, Republican-led, Democratically followed though. The greatest health intervention in the history of medicine to fight HIV-AIDS has been thrown away. It was nearly there. To a space traveler, it\u2019s like getting to Mars and going, \u201cNah, we\u2019ll go back.\u201d It\u2019s bewildering to me.",

      "Hundreds of writers, editors and publishers have gathered for PEN America\u2019s annual gala hosted by Amber Ruffin and featuring a tribute to actor-publisher Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amber Ruffin looked out upon hundreds of writers, publishers and editors gathered for PEN America's annual gala and shared her experience of being on the receiving end of censorship.",
      "\u201cI'm officially a banned book,\u201d the comic-writer joked, referring to her being dropped as a speaker at April's White House Correspondents Dinner. \u201cThey booked me and then they banned me.\u201d",
      "Thursday night's event at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City was a protest against the suppression of speech and a celebration of being permitted to say what you pleased.",
      "Ruffin presided over a dinner-fundraiser that included a tribute to actor-publisher-bibliophile Sarah Jessica Parker, imprisoned Egyptian poet-songwriter-activist Galal El-Behairy, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth and Macmillan CEO Jon Yaged.",
      "One of the biggest ovations was for a non-speaker, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who during a White House meeting in February challenged President Donald Trump over her support for transgender athletes, When Trump suspended funds for a Maine child nutrition program, Mills sued in federal court and prevailed.",
      "PEN America, the century-old free speech organization, brought in Ruffin to host soon after the WHCA withdrew its invitation, contending it wanted to focus on the achievements of journalism. Ruffin is a blunt and sometimes profane critic of Trump and duly went after him Thursday, calling him \u201cgross,\" \u201cincompetent,\u201d \u201cracist\u201d and \u201csexually deviant.\u201d She also praised PEN for the chance to speak out.",
      "\u201cThank you to PEN America for asking me to host and more importantly, thank you, PEN America, for Googling me at least once before asking me to host,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at you, White House Correspondents Association.\u201d",
      "Parker was presented the PEN/Audible Literary Service Award, given in previous years to Patti Smith, Robert Caro and Stephen Sondheim among others.",
      "Parker has been a longtime champion of books and literacy and runs the publishing imprint SJP Lit, where authors include Lucy Caldwell, Linda Grant and Elysha Chang. At the Sundance Film Festival in January, she premiered a documentary film for which she served as executive producer, \u201cThe Librarians,\u201d about the fight against book bans.",
      "\u201cTo censor a book is to limit imagination, curiosity, connection, empathy and inspiration,\u201d Parker said during her acceptance speech. \"Libraries aren't just buildings with shelves. They are a beacon. They are warm in the winter and cool in summer, and they are sanctuaries of possibility. They are a heartbeat of the neighborhood.\"",
      "El-Behairy, who has been imprisoned off and on since 2018 on charges of terrorism and \u201cspreading false news,\u201d won the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award, given to dissidents who have been jailed. The prize was accepted by his sister, Naiera, and father, Abdelfattah, who noted his son \"paid the price for his opposition with the best years of his life wasted in prison.\u201d",
      "Taye Diggs presented the Business Visionary award to Yaged and joked that he liked the Macmillan executive because he didn't publish his children's books just because Diggs was an extremely handsome and successful Black actor.",
      "Wesleyan President Michael S. Roth, a leading critic of Trump\u2019s threats to cancel research funding at Columbia University and other schools, won the PEN/Benenson Courage Award. During a speech that was loudly cheered, he remembered a happy, outspoken and admittedly privileged childhood during which threats to democracy were rarely considered.",
      "\u201cWe are going to have to draw on love and support if we are to resist the slide towards authoritarianism that has gathered momentum across the land,\" Roth said.",
      "PEN is still recovering from a tumultuous 2024. Allegations that leadership was reluctant to criticize Israel's invasion of Gaza and slow to respond to the suffering of Palestinians, including Palestinian writers and journalists, led to so many writers withdrawing from PEN's spring awards ceremony and World Voices festival that both were canceled. PEN CEO Suzanne Nossel departed at the end of the year and a permanent replacement has not yet been announced.",
      "The awards night and World Voices returned this month, although with reminders of the ongoing war in Gaza. Several prize nominees withdrew from competition, including two of the five finalists for the $75,000 Jean Stein Book Award for a work of \u201coriginality, merit, and impact.\u201d The daughters of Stein, the late author, editor and philanthropist, decided the prize money would be donated to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund and to Palestine Legal, a U.S.-based defense organization.",

      "Brown's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "Diaw said Brown cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",

The Grammy and Oscar winner is launching his second headlining tour, promising fresh sounds for his forthcoming album and material from his latest project, \u201cBeethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1).\u201d",
      "Batiste announced Thursday that his Big Money Tour: Jon Batiste Plays America will begin Aug. 27 in Kansas City. He'll groove through more than 30 venues across the U.S. in cities like Detroit, Austin, Texas, Nashville, a co-bill with Diana Ross in St. Louis and Philadelphia, before closing in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 31.",
      "For the first time, Batiste will grace the stages of the Encore Theater in Las Vegas and the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. He hopes the tour will offer attendees a deeper connection to him as an artist for the tour, a nod to his ninth studio album.",
      "\u201cEvery show is both an origin story and a manifesto,\u201d said Batiste, a seven-time Grammy winner who won an Oscar for his work on \u201cSoul\u201d in 2020. The tour comes on the heels of performing the national anthem at this year's Super Bowl and \u201cBeethoven Blues,\u201d which reimagined the famed German pianist\u2019s work and debuted No. 1 on Billboard's classical albums chart.",
      "Batiste, a Louisiana native, is known for his signature rich blend of R&B, hip-hop, swing, jazz and pop. He's also the former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d",
      "The multitalented musician will wrap up his intimate Maestro Tour shows on Monday in Los Angeles.",
      "He expects to be joined on the road by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who is currently facing cancer for the third time and recently released a new book, \u201cThe Book of Alchemy.\u201d",
      "Batiste believes his unreleased music can still forge a connection, even with those hearing it for the first time.",
      "\u201cI try to tell the most up-to-date origin story through the set,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you come to the show and you don\u2019t know any of the music, or you don\u2019t know anybody on stage and it\u2019s your first time seeing me perform or seen me on television, you\u2019ll leave and feel like you know the songs. You\u2019ll connect with the artist, the human being and the movement. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re going to see a play.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the tour will mark the beginning of his \u201cnext era\u201d of music. He views the live performances as an opportunity to introduce new material to audiences, allowing the songs to evolve through connection before ultimately recording them for his forthcoming album.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s about getting the music to a point where you and your community and everybody is acquainted with the sound and feeling of it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve explored every aspect of it. You\u2019ve arranged and rearranged, then go record and share it, versus the opposite, which is most often the case. It\u2019s fresh and brand new. Then you go on tour, and you start discovering things in the music on stage you didn\u2019t even know were there in the studio.\u201d",
      "Along with introducing fresh sounds, Batiste said he'll incorporate some improvisation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always going to find a space in the show where there's improv,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's at the heart of what I\u2019m all about in trying to represent the cultural music that I come from. I really take a responsibility to push forward. This is about bringing people together, channeling the moment and communal expression.\u201d",

      "Actor Daniel Dae Kim more than made the nominee list for the Tony Awards",
      "The first monologue Daniel Dae Kim ever performed was by David Henry Hwang.",
      "He had to do one for his college summer program at the National Theater Institute in Connecticut. Kim chose a scene from \u201cFOB,\" Hwang's play about the assimilation struggles of a Chinese American. So, it's fitting that 35 years later Hwang \u2014 the first Asian American to win the Tony Award for best play \u2014 would be the one to bring Kim into the Tony spotlight.",
      "Known for TV series such as \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d Kim, 56, is the first Asian nominee in the category of best leading actor in a play in the Tonys\u2019 78-year history for his work in a Broadway revival of Hwang\u2019s \u201cYellow Face.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can imagine a lot of things, but I did not imagine this scenario with David,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat I would be in a play with him, that we would both be nominated for Tony Awards and we would be able to call each other friends.\u201d",
      "In the semi-autobiographical show, which ran last fall at the Roundabout Theatre Company, Kim played a satirical version of Hwang. The show also scored nods for best play revival and best performance by a featured actor in a play for first-time nominee Francis Jue, an original 2007 cast member.",
      "You could not have scripted a better ending for a play that was written in response to the musical \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d casting white actors as Asian characters.",
      "Kim's performance was filmed in November and PBS will broadcast \u201cYellow Face\u201d on Friday. The Tonys, airing on CBS on June 8, also will put a spotlight on the play.",
      "This groundbreaking nomination seems like the perfect karmic reward for Kim, who has spent years advocating for greater Asian representation. At the pandemic's height, the Korean American actor was a constant media presence speaking out against anti-Asian hate. He also jump-started a campaign for veteran actor James Hong, then 91, to get a Hollywood star.",
      "He woke up to the news of his nomination after people were able to get around his phone's \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode. His competition includes George Clooney and Cole Escola.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be a huge surprise if I won, but I will say that even getting the nomination is a win especially when you put it in the context of our community and what this means for Asian Americans,\u201d said Kim, whose previous Broadway credits include \u201cThe King and I.\u201d",
      "He admits it's surprising and \u201ca little sad\u201d that no other Asian actor has been in this category. There\u2019s still never been an Asian nominee for best lead actress in a play.",
      "\u201cOf course, the barrier we really want to break is to actually have someone win, and hopefully that happens sooner rather than later, whether it\u2019s me or not.\u201d",
      "Kim is one of seven Asian acting nominees this year. Only three acting trophy winners have been Asian. One was Lea Salonga for \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d and another was Ruthie Ann Miles for \u201cThe King and I.\u201d Coincidentally, the first was BD Wong for best featured actor in Hwang's Tony-winning play, \u201cM. Butterfly.\u201d Hwang takes special pride in helping actors break glass ceilings.",
      "\u201cI get to feel like, \u2018Oh, maybe I\u2019m actually able to make a difference\u2019 and change the culture in the way that my little-kid-self would have loved but would not have thought possible,\" said Hwang, who now has his fourth career Tony nomination. He was last nominated 22 years ago.",
      "For a long time, Hwang felt the only way to get a play with Asian characters made was to set it outside America because \"Broadway audiences are not interested in Asian Americans.\u201d",
      "Historically, productions with Asian ensembles have been musicals set in \u201cthe exotic lands of Asia,\u201d such as \u201cThe King and I,\" said Esther Kim Lee, a theater studies professor at Duke University and author of \u201cThe Theatre of David Henry Hwang.\" \u201cFlower Drum Song,\u201d set in San Francisco, was an exception but the songs and book were by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Hwang actually revised the book in 2002.",
      "\u201cIt's 2025. We finally see an actual Asian American play with an Asian American lead,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou can have \u2018The King and I\u2019 and have great actors and they may get Tony Awards, but it\u2019s really not about Asian Americans. That this has happened with \u2018Yellow Face\u2019 is just incredible.\u201d",
      "The show's two-month run brought the Roundabout a 50% increase in first-time audience members \u2014 \u201ca powerful statement,\" Kim said.",
      "\u201cOne of the nicest compliments I would hear after the show when I would go to the stage door is, \u2018This is the first Broadway show I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\" Kim said. \u201cThat meant a lot to me because bringing Asian Americans into the theater is important and bringing younger people into the theater is important just for the health of theater in general.\u201d",
      "Besides discussing whitewash casting, \u201cYellow Face\u201d examines the pain of the main character's immigrant father. The role is based on Hwang's father's experience being wrongly accused of laundering money for China. With the current anti-immigrant and anti-DEI climate, the show's airing on PBS feels especially vital to Hwang.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a conflict between America and any Asian country, Asian Americans are the first to get targeted,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "PBS is also where in 2020 the five-episode history docuseries \u201cAsian Americans\" aired for Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Kim was a narrator and remains \u201cunequivocally proud\" of the project.",
      "Five years after the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes, Kim sees \u201cYellow Face\u201d simply making it to Broadway as a victory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to get preachy, but I will say that the goal with spotlighting and elevating people of color is not to threaten the establishment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThe goal was really to say everyone can contribute to our society. Everyone can be a positive force for change.\u201d",

      "The Cannes Film Festival has barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137.\u201d",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137,\" in what's believed to be a first for the festival in the #MeToo era.",
      "Festival director Thierry Fremaux confirmed to the French magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9rama that Navarro-Mussy would not be allowed to attend the red carpet premiere of \u201cCase 137\" (\"Dossier 137\" in France) on Thursday night at Cannes. He has a supporting role in the film.",
      "T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported that Navarro-Mussy was accused of rape by three former partners in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The case was dropped last month due to lack of evidence, but T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported the three woman plan to appeal.",
      "\u201cIt is because there is an appeal, and therefore the investigation is still active, that the case is not suspended,\" Fremaux told the French magazine. \u201cWhen a legal decision becomes final, the situation changes.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Navarro-Mussy didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Cannes Film Festival referred inquires to Fremaux's comments to T\u00e9l\u00e9rama.",
      "Navarro-Mussy's attorney, Marion Pouzet-Gagliardi told T\u00e9l\u00e9rama: \u201cI have received no information indicating that any proceedings are ongoing. This proposed complaint with civil party status has, to my knowledge, not been legally filed.\"",
      "The decision marks a shift for the Cannes Film Festival, which has sometimes been criticized for welcoming men accused of sexual misconduct. But some say now that the festival is evolving as the #MeToo movement has made belated inroads into the French film industry.",
      "This year's Cannes opened hours after French actor Gerard Depardieu was found guilty of sexual assault and handed a 18-month suspended prison sentence. When asked about the Depardieu verdict, Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president, said that \u201cthe festival is following this trend in social and political life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe festival is in step with what\u2019s happening today,\u201d Binoche said. \u201c#MeToo took some time to gain strength. We reacted very strongly recently.\"",
      "On Thursday, the French production company of \u201cCase 137,\u201d Haut et Court, said it last week received a warning about the situation.",
      "\u201cEven though the allegations largely predate the production of the film, we agreed with the festival management that the person in question will not accompany the film to Cannes, out of respect for the plaintiffs and their right to be heard, while also respecting the presumption of innocence of the accused,\u201d the company said in a statement.",

      "South Korean artist BIBI has released her sophomore album \u201cEVE: ROMANCE,\u201d blending genre-defying sounds with philosophical themes",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean artist BIBI released her highly anticipated sophomore album \u201cEVE: ROMANCE\u201d on Wednesday, delivering a project that blends her signature genre-defying sound with philosophical twists.",
      "The singer, songwriter and actor, who moves fluidly between pop, R&B, hip-hop and electronic music, has built a reputation for her bold, unapologetic presence in an industry often defined by careful image management. Her latest album features 14 tracks, including six new songs alongside previously released hits like \u201cBam Yang Gang\u201d and \u201cDerre.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, BIBI explained the meaning behind the album\u2019s lead single \u201cApocalypse,\u201d which carries a more poetic Korean title meaning \u201cThe Apple Tree of the End Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought, if there was the fruit of knowledge of good and evil at the beginning, then this would be the apple tree at the end of times,\u201d BIBI said.",
      "\u201cYou know that saying \u2014 when asked what you\u2019d do if the world ended tomorrow, some say they\u2019d plant an apple tree, others say they\u2019d have an orgy. ... But to me, they felt like the same thing. Both are, in essence, acts of planting seeds.\u201d",
      "Her interpretation, merging ideas of creation, pleasure, and existential finality, may come across as provocative in a conservative South Korean society where open discussions about sex remain rare and often taboo.",
      "\u201cIn reality, everything has an end, and what each person chooses to do in that moment is their own,\u201d she added. \u201cIt can\u2019t be labeled as good or bad. After all, isn\u2019t the very idea of good and evil ambiguous?\u201d",
      "One of Korea\u2019s fastest-rising stars with a growing international presence, BIBI reflected on the surprising success of \u201cBam Yang Gang.\u201d The song, which means a chestnut jelly snack in Korean, became a viral sensation in South Korea last year while she was too busy to notice.",
      "\u201cI was filming two dramas simultaneously, so I was really busy,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really feel it at that time. Actually, I felt it more this year because people introduce me saying, \u2018Last year was the year of Bam Yang Gang.\u2018\u201d",
      "Despite her growing popularity, BIBI aspires to maintain an element of \u201cambiguity\u201d in her artistry.",
      "\u201cI want to be a mysterious artist. Like \u2018Gacha!\u2019 \u2014 that kind of feeling. Like you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll get from a Gacha machine,\u201d she explained, referencing the Japanese toy vending machines known for their randomized collectibles.",
      "The album includes \u201cPygma girl,\u201d a track that reimagines the Greek myth of Pygmalion by reversing traditional muse-artist dynamics, suggesting the subject is the art itself rather than merely inspiring the creator.",
      "\u201cMidnight Cruise,\u201d another standout track, was written after she dreamt about her late grandfather before her Coachella performance in 2024.",
      "BIBI will kick off her first global tour in Seoul on May 16, before heading to the United States and Canada. She will then continue across Asia, with stops including Hong Kong and cities in Japan. The tour will conclude in Australia and New Zealand this October.",

      "One would think the job of making the NFL schedule has got somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture",
      "NBC Sports president Rick Cordella put it best when summarizing what the NFL's scheduling department goes through each year.",
      "\u201cI have five kids at home and you never satisfy them all. Just try and do your best, so I think it\u2019s a little bit of that,\u201d Cordella said Wednesday afternoon after he had a chance to look at the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d slate for the upcoming season. \u201cThey have really, really hard jobs. I have no doubt. We\u2019re all campaigning. We\u2019re all leveraging. We all pay a lot of money for these rights and we all want the same thing.\u201d",
      "One would think the job has gotten somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture.",
      "The trade off though is that this is the third year under the league's broadcast deals that all of the games are up for bid for every network.",
      "CBS remains the primary home of the AFC, with the NFC on Fox, but if there is a great NFC matchup during a week when CBS has the doubleheader, that game will end up on CBS. That is the case in Week 1 with Detroit visiting Green Bay in the 4:25 p.m. EDT spot.",
      "Hans Schroeder, the NFL's executive vice president of media distribution, said this year's rotation of the NFC North facing the AFC North and NFC East created a lot of favorable matchups to divide among all the network's broadcast partners.",
      "\u201cWe love every schedule in May. Hopefully we love it in December too,\u201d said Schroeder, who is in his second year leading the league's scheduling team. \u201cWe have a lot of great matchups, and the flexibility of those new TV deals that every game could go into any widow, I think that's the key and to marry that with a team that is relentless in their effort, I think led to a fun and really great schedule.\u201d",
      "Even though the league announced the release date during the first round of the NFL Draft on April 24, the schedule wasn't totally finalized until Tuesday.",
      "Because some of the games started to be announced on Monday during network upfront presentations to advertisers, those matchups were locked in on Sunday night.",
      "The biggest final-minute decision with the early announced games came with the Fox Week 16 Saturday doubleheader on Dec. 20. The league knew it wanted Packers vs. Bears and Eagles vs. Commanders, but didn't finalize the home teams until Sunday night.",
      "If ever there was a year where the league could opt to move the Buffalo-Kansas City game from CBS to prime time, this was the one.",
      "However, the Week 9 matchup will again be on CBS and is the only 4:25 p.m. game on Nov. 2. Going into this season, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have faced each other nine times, including the playoffs. The first matchup in 2020 was on Fox with the rest being on CBS.",
      "\u201cTo be documenting the story of these franchises and star quarterbacks, we're thrilled to keep telling it,\u201d CBS Sports president and CEO David Berson said.",
      "CBS also got what could be the most-watched game during the regular season with Kansas City visiting Dallas on Thanksgiving Day. The most-watched Thanksgiving game was in 2022 when the New York Giants win over Dallas averaged 42.06 million on Fox.",
      "The Chiefs and Bills are both slated to have nine games on CBS.",
      "It is rare that a Super Bowl rematch airs on the network that carried the game, but Fox gets Kansas City visiting Philadelphia on Week 2 in the 4:25 p.m. EDT window.",
      "Getting the rematch satisfied a couple of requests that Fox made to the league. The network wants more variety in its late afternoon window, and is also getting more quality matchups when the top AFC teams play on their network.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be so reliant on the Dallas Cowboys. I think we hear complaints sometimes that fans feel like it gets a little bit monotonous that our 4:25 window is dominated by one team,\u201d said Mike Mulvihill, Fox Sports president, insight and analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly still going to have our share of Dallas games, but we\u2019re going to have some Philly in there too. We\u2019re also going to have Buffalo, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Washington. I think it is pretty different than what you\u2019re used to seeing on Fox, and I think it\u2019s actually going to be a little bit better.\u201d",
      "NBC not only has the Kickoff game between Dallas and Philadelphia on Sept. 4, it has the matchup between the last two NFL MVPs when Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens visit Allen and Buffalo on Sept. 7 on \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d.",
      "ABC will have 13 \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games \u2014 11 simulcasts with ESPN and two exclusive games. There will also be two MNF doubleheaders on Sept. 15 and Oct. 20. The Week 7 doubleheader will have the late game between Houston and Seattle streamed on ESPN+.",
      "\u201cThursday Night Football on Prime Video\u201d features all 14 playoff teams from last year as well as 10 divisional matchups. Prime Video concludes its regular-season slate with Denver at Kansas City on Christmas night. The Black Friday game between Chicago and Philadelphia will also include an NBA doubleheader afterward.",
      "Derek Carr's retirement did not have any impact on New Orleans' schedule. The Saints were already in a rebuilding mode under new coach Kellen Moore and join Cleveland and Tennessee as the only teams not slated to make a prime time appearance.",
      "Pittsburgh is already a national brand, so the waiting game on if Aaron Rodgers suits up in black and yellow or who will be Mike Tomlin's quarterback also didn't have much of a factor. The Steelers \u2014 along with AFC North rivals Baltimore and Cincinnati \u2014 have four prime time games.",
      "However, in case Rodgers decides to sign with Pittsburgh, his Week 1 opponent will be at the New York Jets and former Steelers quarterback Justin Fields.",

      "An athlete will aim to be the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard to educate the public on sharks",
      "VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- Lewis Pugh has followed an unspoken rule during his career as one of the world\u2019s most daring endurance swimmers: Don\u2019t talk about sharks. But he plans to break that this week on a swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201c Jaws\u201d was filmed 50 years ago.",
      "The British-South African was the first person to complete a long-distance swim in every ocean of the world \u2014 and has taken on extreme conditions everywhere from Mount Everest to the Arctic.",
      "\u201cOn this swim, it\u2019s very different: We\u2019re just talking about sharks all the time,\u201d joked Pugh, who will, as usual, wear no wetsuit.",
      "For his swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard in 47-degree (8-degree Celsius) water he will wear just trunks, a cap and goggles.",
      "Pugh, 55, is undertaking the challenge because he wants to change public perception around the now at-risk animals \u2014 which he said were maligned by the blockbuster film as \u201cvillains, as cold-blooded killers.\u201d He will urge for more protection for sharks.",
      "On Thursday, beginning at the Edgartown Harbor Lighthouse, he will swim for three or four hours in the brutally cold surf, mark his progress and spend the rest of his waking hours on the Vineyard educating the public about sharks. Then, he'll get in the water and do it again \u2014 and again, for an estimated 12 days, or however long it takes him to complete the 62-mile (100-kilometer) swim.",
      "He begins the journey just after the New England Aquarium confirmed the first white shark sighting of the season, earlier this week off the coast of Nantucket.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to test me not only physically, but also mentally,\u201d he said, while scoping out wind conditions by the starting line. \u201cI mean every single day I\u2019m going to be speaking about sharks, sharks, sharks, sharks. Then, ultimately, I\u2019ve got to get in the water afterwards and do the swim. I suppose you can imagine what I\u2019ll be thinking about.\u201d",
      "Pugh said the swim will be among the most difficult he\u2019s undertaken, which says a lot for someone who has swum near glaciers and volcanoes, and among hippos, crocodiles and polar bears. No one has ever swum around the island of Martha's Vineyard before.",
      "But Pugh, who often swims to raise awareness for environmental causes \u2014 and was this year named the United Nations Patron of the Oceans \u2014 said no swim is without risk and that drastic measures are needed to get his message across: Around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day \u2014 a rate of 100 million every year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "\u201cIt was a film about sharks attacking humans and for 50 years, we have been attacking sharks,\u201d he said of \u201cJaws.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s completely unsustainable. It\u2019s madness. We need to respect them.\u201d",
      "He emphasizes that the swim is not something nonprofessionals should attempt. He\u2019s accompanied by safety personnel in a boat and kayak and uses a \u201cShark Shield\u201d device that deters sharks using an electric field without harming them.",
      "Pugh remembers feeling fear as a 16-year-old watching \u201cJaws\u201d for the first time. Over decades of study and research, awe and respect have replaced his fear, as he realized the role they play in maintaining Earth\u2019s increasingly fragile ecosystems.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more terrified of a world without sharks, or without predators,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d is credited for creating Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster culture when it was released in summer 1975, becoming the highest grossing film up until that time and earning three Academy Awards. It would impact how many viewed the ocean for decades to come.",
      "Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley have expressed regret over the impact of the film on viewers\u2019 perception of sharks. Both have since contributed to conservation efforts for animals, which have seen populations depleted due to factors like overfishing and climate change.",
      "Discovery Channel and the National Geographic Channel each year release programming about sharks to educate the public about the predator.",
      "Greg Skomal, marine fisheries biologist at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Fisheries within the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, said many people tell him they still won't swim in the ocean because of the sheer terror caused by the film.",
      "\u201cI tend to hear the expression that, \u2018I haven\u2019t gone in the water since \u2018Jaws\u2019 came out,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "But Skomal, who published a book challenging the film's inaccuracies, said \u201cJaws\u201d also inspired many people \u2014 including him \u2014 to study marine biology, leading to increased research, acceptance and respect for the creatures.",
      "If \u201cJaws\u201d were made today, he doesn't think it'd have the same effect. But in the 1970s, \u201cit was just perfect in terms of generating this level of fear to a public that was largely uneducated about sharks, because we were uneducated. Scientists didn\u2019t know a lot about sharks.\u201d",
      "Skomal said the biggest threat contributing to the decline of the shark population now is commercial fishing, which exploded in the late 1970s and is today driven by high demand for fins and meat used in food dishes, as well as the use of skin to make leather and oil and cartilage for cosmetics.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve really moved away from this feeling, or the old adage that, \u2018The only good shark is a dead shark,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely morphing from fear to fascination, or perhaps a combination of both.\u201d",

      "Based on his growth rate and tooth loss, Morris the alligator was at least 80 years old when he died, the Colorado Gator Farm said in a Facebook post Sunday. He was nearly 11 feet (3.3 meters) long and weighed 640 pounds (290 kilograms).",
      "\"He started acting strange about a week ago. He wasn\u2019t lunging at us and wasn\u2019t taking food,\u201d Jay Young, the farm\u2019s owner and operator, said in a video as he tearfully stroked Morris' head in an animal enclosure.",
      "\u201cI know it's strange to people that we get so attached to an alligator, to all of our animals. ... He had a happy time here, and he died of old age,\" he said.",
      "Morris, who was found in the backyard of a Los Angeles home as an illegal pet, started his Hollywood career in 1975 and retired in 2006, when he was sent to the Colorado Gator Farm in the tiny town of Mosca.

    "story": [
      "The trials of Lyle and Erik Menendez and their conviction for killing their parents came at a time when televised trials captured national audiences in the 1990s",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The trials of Lyle and Erik Menendez came at a time of cultural obsession with courts, crime and murder, when live televised trials captivated a national audience.",
      "Their resentencing \u2014 and the now very real possibility of their freedom \u2014 came at another, when true crime documentaries and docudramas have proliferated and brought renewed attention to the family.",
      "A judge made the Menendez brothers eligible for parole Tuesday when he reduced their sentences from life without parole to 50 years to life for the 1989 murder of their father Jose Menendez and mother Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills home. The state parole board will now determine whether they can be released.",
      "Their two trials bookended the O.J. Simpson trial, creating a mid-1990s phenomenon where courts subsumed soap operas as riveting daytime television.",
      "\u201cPeople were not used to having cameras in the courtroom. For the first time we were seeing the drama of justice in real time,\u201d said Vinnie Politan, a Court TV anchor who hosts the nightly \u201cClosing Arguments\u201d on the network. \"Everyone was watching cable and everyone had that common experience. Today there\u2019s a true crime bonanza happening, but it's splintered off into so many different places.\u201d",
      "The brothers became an immediate sensation with their 1990 arrest. They represented a pre-tech-boom image of young wealthy men as portrayed in many a 1980s movie: the tennis-playing, Princeton-bound prep.",
      "For many viewers, this image was confirmed by the spending spree they went on after the killings. Their case continued a fascination with the dark, private lives of the young and wealthy that goes back at least to the Leopold and Loeb murder case of the 1930s, but had been in the air in cases like the Billionaire Boys Club, a 1980s Ponzi scheme that spurred a murder.",
      "Their first trials in 1993 and 1994 became a landmark for then-new Court TV, which aired it nearly in its entirety. Defense lawyers conceded that they had shot their parents. The jury, and the public, then had to consider whether the brothers' testimony about sexual and other abuse from their father was plausible, and should mean conviction on a lesser charge.",
      "The lasting image from the trial was Lyle Menendez crying on the stand as he described the abuse.",
      "At the time there had been some public reckoning with the effects of sex abuse, but not nearly to the extent of today.",
      "The two juries \u2014 one for each brother \u2014 deadlocked, largely along gender lines. It reflected the broader cultural reaction \u2014 with women supporting a manslaughter conviction and men a guilty verdict for first-degree murder.",
      "The trials came at a time when crime in the U.S. was at an all-time high, a tough-on-crime stance was a prerequisite for holding major political office, and a wave of legislation mandating harsher sentences was passed.",
      "That attitude appeared to prevail when, at their second trial, the brothers were both convicted of first-degree murder.",
      "As Associated Press trial reporter Linda Deutsch, who covered both trials along with Simpson\u2019s and countless others, wrote in 1996:",
      "\u201cThis time, the jury rejected the defense claim that the brothers murdered their parents after years of sexual abuse. Instead, it embraced the prosecution theory that the killings were planned and that the brothers were greedy, spoiled brats who murdered to get their parents\u2019 $14 million fortune.\u201d",
      "The second trial was not televised and got less attention.",
      "\u201cThere were no cameras, it was in the shadow of O.J. so it didn\u2019t have the same spark and pop as the first one,\u201d Politan said.",
      "They had become too well-known to be forgotten, but for decades, the Menendez brothers faded into the background. Occasional stories emerged about the brothers losing their appeals, as did mugshots of them aging in prison.",
      "\u201cThe public\u2019s memory of them was, \u2018Yeah, I remember that trial, the guys with the sweaters in court,\u2019\u201d Politan said.",
      "That would change in the era of true-crime TV, podcasts and streamers.",
      "The 2017 NBC drama series \u201cLaw & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders,\" wasn't widely watched, but still brought the case new attention. The next decade would prove more important.",
      "The 2023 Peacock docuseries \u201cMenendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed\u201d included a former member saying he was raped by Jose Menendez when he was 14. At about the same time, the brothers submitted a letter that Erik wrote to his cousin about his father\u2019s abuse before the killings.",
      "The new true-crime wave would continue to promote them, even if the portrayal wasn't always flattering.",
      "\" Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\" a drama created by Ryan Murphy on Netflix, made them beautiful and vain buffoons, and the actors were shown shirtless on provocative billboards. Javier Bardem as Jose Menendez brought Oscar-winning star power to the project that dropped in September of last year.",
      "That was followed a month later by a documentary on Netflix, \u201cThe Menendez Brothers.\u201d",
      "Together, the shows had the public paying more attention to the case than it had since the trials. Almost simultaneously came a real-life turning point, when then- Los Angeles District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said he was reviewing new evidence in the case.",
      "The office of Gasc\u00f3n's successor, Nathan Hochman, opposed the resentencing.",
      "Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian constantly sought at hearings to make sure the \u201ccarnage\u201d caused by the brothers wasn't forgotten, and repeatedly emphasized that they \u201cshotgunned, brutally, their parents to death.\u201d",
      "But the shifts in public perception and legal actions were already in motion. The judge's decision to reduce their charges came not with the drama of the televised trial, but in a short hearing in a courtroom that wouldn't allow cameras. The broader public never saw.",
      "Despite his opposition, Hochman was reflective in a statement after the resentencing.",
      "\u201cThe case of the Menendez brothers has long been a window for the public to better understand the judicial system,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cThis case, like all cases \u2014 especially those that captivate the public \u2014 must be viewed with a critical eye. Our opposition and analysis ensured that the Court received a complete and accurate record of the facts. Justice should never be swayed by spectacle.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A former model has reproached one of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s lawyers for suggesting that her sexual abuse allegations against the ex-studio boss are lies",
      "NEW YORK -- A former model reproached one of Harvey Weinstein \u2019s lawyers for suggesting that her sexual abuse allegations against the ex-studio boss are lies.",
      "\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself,\u201d Kaja Sokola retorted. In her fifth and final day of testimony at Weinstein's sex crimes retrial, she maintained that she was telling the truth and that Weinstein's alleged conduct in her teens had changed the course of her life.",
      "\u201cIt changed the course of your life in that you got $3.5 million from false accusations?\u201d defense lawyer Mike Cibella pressed, referring to compensation she was awarded through civil proceedings in recent years.",
      "\u201cNo. That\u2019s very unfair,\" Sokola said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "During her days on the witness stand, she said Weinstein repeatedly offered to foster her acting ambitions but then made unwanted physical advances, beginning when she was 16 in 2002.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces a sexual assault charge related solely to her allegation that he forced oral sex on her when she was 19. He also faces charges based on two other women's claims. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges, and his attorneys assert that his accusers had consensual sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer because they wanted movie and TV work.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers grilled Sokola about her requests for career help from him after the alleged assault, her motives for her civil lawsuits and criminal trial testimony, as well as her personal struggles, and even a private journal she kept for an alcohol-abuse program in her native Poland.",
      "After apparently getting the decade-old writings via the witness' sister, the defense was allowed to bring up portions in which Sokola said two other men had sexually assaulted her over the years but didn't say the same about Weinstein. Instead, she wrote that he promised her help but didn't deliver.",
      "Sokola testified Wednesday that she had left out Weinstein's alleged sexual abuse partly because she couldn't come to terms with it at the time. Also, she said, her sponsor was in the film business in Poland and knew who Weinstein was.",
      "Cibella questioned that explanation, noting that the text mentioned only \u201cHarvey W\u201d and nothing about his profession. Sokola said her sponsor nonetheless knew his identity because they talked about it.",
      "Tearing up as she spoke, she said she hadn\u2019t seen the black notebook for 10 years, never gave anyone permission to share it and was stunned and appalled to be confronted with it in court.",
      "\u201cI felt very violated,\u201d said Sokola, now 39 and a psychotherapist.",
      "She was the second of Weinstein's accusers to testify at the retrial, and the only one who wasn't involved in his first trial in 2020. That proceeding led to a landmark #MeToo-era conviction that was subsequently overturned, setting up the retrial. Prosecutors decided to add Sokola's allegations to it.",
      "Another woman, Miriam Haley, already has told jurors at the retrial that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify in the coming days or weeks. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission to be identified. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "Lyle Menendez was attending Princeton University, and his younger brother Erik Menendez was a tennis star.",

      "Parole suitability hearings are conducted by a state board to determine if a person should be released. An inmate will be scheduled for their first hearing no later than six months following their eligibility date, according to board policy.",
      "They already have a hearing before the board scheduled for June 13 in a clemency petition they\u2019ve submitted to Gov. Gavin Newsom. It\u2019s not yet clear if that will serve as their formal parole hearing or if a separate one will be scheduled.",
      "Newsom ordered the state parole board to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for him to determine their danger to the public if released.",
      "Anne Bremner, a trial lawyer in Seattle, said the brothers will have some pressure on them to prepare for the parole board and impress upon them that they should be let out.",
      "\u201cMy guess is the parole board has been watching this and of course they\u2019ve done these risk assessments already,\u201d she said. They know \u201cwho these two are, what their alleged crimes were and what they\u2019ve done since the time that they were incarcerated until today.\u201d",

      "If parole is granted, Newsom could still move to override the board. If he lets the parole decision stand, the brothers would be released from prison.",
      "In May 2023, the brothers\u2019 attorneys also filed a petition for habeas corpus to the court, asking for a new trial in light of new evidence of their sexual abuse. LA prosecutors have filed a motion opposing that petition, but its status is unclear.",

      "Attention spans are shrinking, with research showing the average person's has declined from 2.5 minutes in 2004 to 47 seconds now",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Feel like you can't focus? Like you'll never finish a book again? Like the only way to keep your mind and hands busy is to scroll on social media for hours?",
      "You're far from alone. One body of decades-long research found the average person's attention span for a single screen is 47 seconds, down from 2.5 minutes in 2004. The 24/7 news cycle, uncertainty about the state of the world and countless hours of screen time don\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen my patients talk to me about this stuff there is often a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ziffra, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cBut you can change these behaviors. You can improve your attention span.\u201d",
      "Here are ways to start that process. As you read, challenge yourself to set a 2.5 minute timer and stay on this article without looking at another device or clicking away.",
      "A shifting attention is an evolutionary feature, not a bug. Our brains are hardwired to quickly filter information and hone in on potential threats or changes in what's happening around us.",
      "What's grabbing our attentions has changed. For our ancestors, it might have been a rustle in the bushes putting us on guard for a lurking tiger. Today, it could be a rash of breaking news alerts and phone notifications.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic warped many people's sense of time and increased their screen usage like never before, said Stacey Nye, a clinical psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.",
      "Technology isn't the only thing that influences our attention, experts say, but the effects of those pinging notifications or hours scrolling through 30-second long videos can build up over time.",
      "\u201cOur attention span has really been trained to only focus in those little, small blips and it interrupts our natural focus cycles,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts say \u201cactive\u201d breaks are among the best way to retrain your mind and your attention. They only take about 30 minutes, Nye said, and can be as simple as taking a walk while noticing things around you or moving to another room for lunch.",
      "Don't be afraid to get creative. Develop a list of alternative activities or randomly choose ideas out of a fish bowl. Try craft projects, a short meditation, fixing a quick meal or talking a walk outside. All the better if you can involve a friend as well.",
      "The break needs to be a physical or mental activity \u2014 no passive phone-scrolling.",
      "When the brain is understimulated and looking for change, it\u2019ll usually grab onto the first thing it sees. The smartphone, an \u201cever-producing change machine,\u201d is an enticing option, said Cindy Lustig, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan.",
      "Turn off unnecessary notifications and put that \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode to good use, especially before bedtime. Better yet, put your phone in a whole different room, Lustig said.",
      "Multitasking may make you feel like you're getting more done, but brain experts recommend against it.",
      "\u201cBe a single tasker,\" Nye said. \u201cWork on one thing at a time, for a specified period of time and begin to work your way up.\u201d",
      "Lustig is a big fan of the \u201cPomodoro technique,\" in which you set a timer and work on something for 25 or 30 minutes before taking a five-minute break.",
      "She tells herself: \u201cI can do anything for this amount of time,\" and the world will still be waiting for her at the end.",
      "It's not enough to just have a hobby, Lustig said. It helps to choose hobbies that include deliberate practice and a goal to strive toward, whether it's playing guitar for an audience or improving in a sport.",
      "It helps to pick something that you enjoy as well.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to start with the heavy nonfiction or like \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u201d Lustig said. \u201cIf you need to start with the romance novel, then start with the romance novel. You can work your way up.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone has good and bad days, and attention needs are different \u2014 and even vary from task to task.",
      "The key is to make an intentional effort, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is in many ways similar to a muscle in the sense that we can build it up with practice and exercises,\u201d Ziffra said. \u201cConversely, it can weaken if we\u2019re not exercising it.\u201d",

The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria\u2019s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.",
      "\u201cFeeding is severely difficult,\u201d said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa \u2014 virtually the entire population \u2014 rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated \u201csafe zone,\u201d which severely limits farming.",
      "For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.",
      "Programs serving children were hit hard.",
      "Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.",
      "But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.",
      "She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bury another child,\u201d she said.",
      "Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.",
      "He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.",
      "\u201cIt is very traumatic,\u201d said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. \u201cOne of the things is the threat to the lives of children.\u201d",
      "UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.",
      "Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.",
      "\u201cBefore the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,\u201d said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. \u201cNow my biggest worry is high mortality. We don\u2019t have enough resources to keep up.\u201d",
      "Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.",
      "The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.",
      "\u201cIt used to be far less,\u201d said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.",
      "The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.",
      "\u201cBefore, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,\u201d said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. \u201cNow, that has stopped.\u201d",
      "Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, \u201csadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.\u201d He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.",
      "The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.",
      "In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the needy, said Frederico Jo\u00e3o, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.",
      "More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inoc\u00eancio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.",

      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes toxic behavior at work and the kinds of treatment people won't tolerate for a steady paycheck",
      "NEW YORK -- One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Groutte spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn\u2019t land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \u201cIt was this implied, \u2018You\u2019re stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "But eventually, she found a way out. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she worked a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\u201cYou can't put a price tag on it,\u201d she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\u201d",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\u201d said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \u201cif I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a \u2018Suck it up\u2019 attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\u201d",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\u201cWhat makes something toxic: it\u2019s more pervasive, more consistent over time,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said. \u201cYou may have tried some things and it\u2019s not getting better. ... It\u2019s very deeply entrenched.\u201d",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\u201cIt is a relationship where you can\u2019t communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can\u2019t say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\u201d Atchison said.",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I\u2019m applying to, because I can\u2019t lose my hair again over a job,\u201d said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\u201d Atchison said. \u201cIf someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\u201d",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\u201cSocializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you\u2019re talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don\u2019t internalize it. And don\u2019t take someone\u2019s perception as fact.\u201d",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \u201cI\u2019m going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else\u2019s opinion?\u201d",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \u201cIn the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it\u2019s you who has to go somewhere,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \u201cyou wouldn't say, \u2018Let me try to work with the radon,\u2019 or \u2018How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\u201d",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\u201cIf somebody gives you an impression that you\u2019re not able to leave this job, that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Grouette said. \u201cThose sorts of people don\u2019t have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they\u2019re volatile to you, they\u2019re volatile to others.\u201d",

      "Missouri lawmakers have approved a referendum seeking to repeal an abortion-rights amendment passed by voters six months ago",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Six months after Missouri voters approved an abortion-rights amendment, Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday approved a new referendum that would seek the amendment's repeal and instead ban most abortions with exceptions for rape an incest.",
      "The newly proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner, if Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election before then.",
      "Republican senators used a series of rare procedural moves to cut off discussion by opposing Democrats before passing the proposed abortion-rights revision by a 21-11 vote. The measure passed the Republican-led House last month.",
      "Immediately after the vote, protestors erupted with chants of \u201cStop the ban!\u201d and were ushered out of the Senate chamber.",
      "The Senate then blocked further Democratic debate and gave final approval to a separate measure repealing provisions of a voter-approved law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage. That measure does not go back to the ballot. It will instead become law when signed by Kehoe, who has expressed his support for it.",
      "After taking the sweeping votes, the Senate effectively ended its annual legislative session \u2014 two days ahead of a constitutional deadline to wrap up work.",
      "Democrats were outraged by the legislative actions and vowed to retaliate by slowing down any Senate work next year.",
      "\u201cOur rights are under attack,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Brian Williams said during debate. He accused Republicans of \u201ctrying to overturn the will of the voters.\u201d",
      "Republicans contend they are simply giving voters a second chance on abortion \u2014 and are confident they will change their minds because of the new rape and incest exceptions.",
      "\u201cAbortion is the greatest tragedy in the world right now,\u201d Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman said while explaining her efforts to repeal the abortion-rights amendment. If someone's fine with \u201ctaking the life of an innocent, then probably you can justify whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Some GOP lawmakers said they needed to repeal the paid sick leave requirement, which kicked in May 1, because it's adding costs that threaten the financial viability of small businesses. Republicans had been negotiating with Democrats over an alternative to exempt only the smallest businesses before scrapping that and opting for the full repeal.",
      "Missouri lawmakers have a history of altering voter-approved policies. They previously tried to block funding for a voter-approved Medicaid expansion and authored changes to voter-approved measures regulating dog breeders and legislative redistricting.",
      "Missouri's abortion policies have swung dramatically in recent years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning most abortions. But abortion-rights activists gathered initiative petition signatures to reverse that.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. The amendment also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "A limited number of surgical abortions have since occurred in Missouri, but medication abortions remain on hold while Planned Parenthood wrangles with the state over abortion regulations.",
      "The new measure seeks to repeal the abortion-rights amendment and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. It also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Polling indicates \u201cthat most voters are opposed to most abortions in Missouri but do want to allow for abortions with limited exceptions,\u201d said Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri.",
      "The ballot title that voters will see doesn't explicitly mention repealing Amendment 3. Instead, it says the new measure would \u201censure women's safety during abortions, ensure parental consent for minors\" and \u201callow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest.\u201d It also states that it will \u201cprotect children from gender transition,\u201d among other provisions.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Tracy McCreery called the measure \u201can attempt to mislead and lie to the voters,\u201d echoing similar accusations that Republicans had made against the original Amendment 3.",
      "An abortion-rights coalition that includes Planned Parenthood affiliates, the American Civil Liberties Union and others planned a rally Thursday at the Missouri Capitol and vowed a vigorous campaign against the measure.",
      "\u201cAbortion rights won in this state six months ago, and mark my words: Missourians will protect reproductive freedom again,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of what are known as forever chemicals in drinking water",
      "On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.",
      "The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.",
      "President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.",
      "Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:",
      "PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation\u2019s air, water and soil.",
      "They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.",
      "The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.",
      "Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable \u2013 resistance to breakdown \u2013 make them hazardous to people.",
      "PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.",
      "There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.",
      "The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.",
      "The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration\u2019s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to meet them.",
      "Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\u201cThe law is very clear that the EPA can\u2019t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,\u201d said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.",
      "Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.",
      "\u201cHowever, EPA\u2019s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,\u201d the industry group said.",
      "Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.",
      "Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "They did, however, get an extension.",
      "\u201cThis gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,\u201d said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy wanted an assurance from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before he would vote to put him in charge of the nation's $1.7 trillion health department.",
      "Kennedy's history of promoting conspiracy theories or misspeaking about vaccines alarmed Cassidy, he said during a confirmation hearing earlier this year.",
      "So, the Louisiana senator asked: \"Can I trust that that is now in the past?\"",
      "Kennedy didn't give a direct answer that day. Now three months into the job, however, Kennedy's habit of casting doubts on vaccines has returned in interviews on television shows, public speeches and social media posts.",
      "Kennedy will make his first appearance as health secretary before Cassidy\u2019s powerful Senate health committee on Wednesday, when he's expected to face intense scrutiny about the thousands of job he's eliminated at the Department of Health and Human Services, the steep cuts he's made to vaccination campaigns and his response to a measles outbreak that\u2019s sickened 1,000 people.",
      "He will speak about the agency\u2019s budget request for the year, which includes a $500 million boost for his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative to promote nutrition and healthier lifestyles. The proposed budget also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and preschool programs.",
      "The secretary plans to \"share his vision on how HHS\u2019 transformation will improve health outcomes, eliminate redundancies to save the American taxpayer, and streamline operations to improve efficiency and service,\u201d HHS said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, have viewed his first three months in the job as a successful delivery of \u201cMAHA\u201d agenda items: He's pressured food companies to ditch artificial dyes, promised to study the cause of autism, vowed to reverse fluoride recommendations and earned buy-in from several Republican governors to ban soda from the food stamp program, for example.",
      "But many eyes and ears will be on Kennedy's dialogue with Cassidy, who extracted a number of guarantees from Kennedy about his approach to vaccines. Those included promises to keep the current childhood vaccination schedule, use the current vaccine monitoring system and not remove statements that say vaccines do not cause autism on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.",
      "\u201cI will watch carefully for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidences and anecdote,\u201d Cassidy said earlier this year, after voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Kennedy has since delivered a mixed message on vaccines that public health experts have said are hampering efforts to contain the measles outbreak. He's offered endorsements of vaccinations but continued to raise questions about their efficacy or safety. He's said the childhood vaccine schedule will be examined in a study of autism's causes. He\u2019s called the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine \u2014 a shot given to children to provide immunity from all three diseases \u2014 \u201cleaky,\u201d although it offers lifetime protection from the measles for most people. He's also said they cause deaths, although none has been documented among healthy people.",
      "At the agency, too, he's made moves that support the anti-vaccine movement. He hired a man who has published research that suggests vaccines cause developmental delays to oversee a study on autism. And he's terminated some research and public health funds dedicated to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, who has rejected the anti-vaccine label, has regularly said that he is \u201cpro-safety\" and wants more research on vaccines, although decades of real-world use and research have concluded they safely prevent deadly diseases in children.",
      "\u201cHis longstanding advocacy has always focused on ensuring that vaccines, and other medical interventions, meet the highest standards of safety and are supported by gold-standard science,\u201d HHS said in a statement. \u201cAs he did during confirmation, Secretary Kennedy is prepared to address questions surrounding this topic.\u201d",

      "A judge has ordered the restoration of a health monitoring program for coal miners in West Virginia and rescinded layoffs in a unit of a small U.S. health agency",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A judge on Tuesday ordered the restoration of a health monitoring program for coal miners in West Virginia and rescinded layoffs the federal government implemented in a unit of a small U.S. health agency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by a coal miner who was diagnosed with a respiratory ailment commonly known as black lung disease.",
      "Nearly 200 workers at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility in Morgantown were told last month that their jobs were being terminated as part of restructuring within Health and Human Services. Berger ordered that jobs be restored within NIOSH's respiratory health division in Morgantown, although her ruling didn't specify a number. The division is responsible for screening and reviewing medical exams to determine whether there is evidence that miners have developed black lung.",
      "Federal law mandates that regular health screenings be made available to coal miners. Those diagnosed with black lung also are given the option to transfer to other positions in a mine to protect them from continued dust exposure without a pay reduction.",
      "Berger said the defendants \u201clack the authority to unilaterally cancel\u201d the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program within NIOSH. She ordered both the surveillance and job transfer programs to be restored, saying that \u201cthere be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services\" mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act.",
      "Poisonous silica dust has contributed to the premature deaths of thousands of mine workers from black lung disease. Plaintiff Harry Wiley, a West Virginia mine electrician who has worked in coal mines for 38 years, was diagnosed with early-stage black lung last November.",
      "Canceling the health surveillance program would \"cost lives,\u201d Berger wrote. \u201cRemaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.\u201d",
      "The judge gave Kennedy 20 days to show the federal government is complying with her order.",
      "An email seeking comment from Health and Human Services wasn't immediately returned Tuesday night.",
      "Wiley's attorney, Sam Brown Petsonk, said the preliminary injunction \u201chad to happen, and the public, I think, understands the absolute necessity of this program. It cannot be hindered. It cannot be whittled away. It\u2019s essential because it saves the lives of some of he hardest-working people in this entire world.\u201d",
      "NIOSH was created under a 1970 law signed by President Richard Nixon. It started operations the following year and grew to have offices and labs in eight cities, including Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Morgantown, and Spokane, Washington.",

      "\u201cMichiganders have the fundamental right to reproductive freedom, including the right to abortion care, and the state cannot deny, burden or infringe upon this freedom barring a compelling state interest to protect the health of the individual seeking care,\u201d Judge Sima Patel said.",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has signed a bill into law to make Maryland the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to pay for an abortion grant program",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland will become the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to fund a program to pay for abortions, regardless of a patient's insurance coverage, under a measure signed into law Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.",
      "The law will make about $25 million available when it takes effect July 1, because a $1 surcharge has been unused and growing over the last 15 years since the ACA took effect in 2010. It's estimated to make about $3 million available annually in future years.",
      "\u201cThe lieutenant governor and I were very clear from Day 1 \u2014 that Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d Moore said, highlighting the measure among SOME 170 bills signed at a ceremony.",
      "The program will be paid for through the transfer of certain insurance premium funds collected by carriers that can only be used for abortion coverage in accordance with the ACA. Supporters say other states have access to a similar surplus of funds through their state exchange insurance systems.",
      "\u201cIf programs like ours are duplicated across the country, we could help millions of Americans access essential abortion care \u2014 without relying on taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Del. Lesley Lopez, a Democrat from Maryland's Montgomery County, in the suburbs of the nation's capital.",
      "Officials in New York and Illinois already have reached out to Maryland officials to learn more about the program, said Lopez, who sponsored the bill.",
      "A dozen states require abortion coverage in ACA marketplace plans, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. They are California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.",
      "\u201cThis money exists in every state that has abortion as a required type of care under their state\u2019s benefit exchanges,\" Lopez said. \"It\u2019s basically all the blue states that mandated abortion be covered when the Affordable Care Act was starting to be implemented.\u201d",
      "The law creates a grant program fund in the state's health department to improve access to abortion clinical services. It requires the department to award grants to nonprofit organizations to support equitable access.",
      "Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund, which helps pay costs associated with abortion for people who live in Maryland or who travel there, said it\u2019s hard to keep up with an annual budget of about $2 million.",
      "\u201cWe would need many, many more times over that to fully be able to meet the full logistic and medical support for each caller,\u201d she said.",
      "She said the $3 million that would be made available annually under the new law could make a major difference. The fund could apply to administer a share of that money.",
      "\u201cThe $3 million is a great start, but it will take more than that and it will take sustained funding,\u201d she said.",
      "Maryland's legislature is controlled by Democrats, who hold a 2-1 advantage over Republicans in voter registration statewide. Last year, Maryland voters approved a constitutional amendment with 76% support to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution, in response to the 2022 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. The court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization gave control over abortion to the states.",
      "\u201cI think before the Dobbs decision, there just wasn\u2019t quite the same type of urgency as there is now,\" Lopez said. \"We\u2019ve seen abortion bans in some form or another in double digits in states across the country, so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we shore up all the support we can in a state like Maryland that has it as a constitutionally protected right.\u201d",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The Dobb decision and an influx of people from other states seeking abortions in Maryland has made the financial need more urgent, supporters of the law say.",
      "Maryland has been seeing an increase in patients from other states where abortion has been banned. Last year, 15% of abortions in Maryland were obtained by patients from other states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That's a decrease from 20% in 2023.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. health officials say they plan to phase out fluoride-containing supplements used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, citing possible health risks",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health regulators announced plans Tuesday to phase out fluoride-containing supplements sometimes used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, opening a new front in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s effort against a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it will conduct a scientific review of the products by late October with the aim of removing them from the market. It was not immediately clear whether the agency planned to formally ban the supplements or simply request that companies withdraw them.",
      "The products targeted by the FDA are sometimes recommended for children and teens who are at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities because of low fluoride in their local drinking water. They usually require a prescription from a pediatrician or dentist. Fluoride-based tablets and lozenges are designed to be chewed or swallowed. Companies also sell drops for babies and infants.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed by children because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions. He also referenced studies showing possible associations between excess fluoride intake and other problems, including decreased IQ.",
      "Previous reviews by public health experts and dental professionals have not shown any serious health risks with the products.",
      "As state and local governments begin removing fluoride from their water, the need for supplemental fluoride is expected to grow.",
      "Officials in Utah \u2014 the first U.S. state to ban fluoride from drinking water \u2014 recently made fluoride supplements available without a prescription.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1962, the agency set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d tied to a range of health dangers. Last month, he announced a task force to scrutinize fluoride's use, while at the same time saying he would order the CDC to stop recommending it.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program concluded that drinking water with more than twice the CDC\u2019s recommended level was associated with lower IQs in kids. The study was based on research conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico.",
      "\u201cEnding the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. \"This decision brings us one step closer to delivering on President Trump\u2019s promise to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "An influential government health panel recommends fluoride supplements for children between the ages of six months and 5 years if they live in areas with low fluoridation levels. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Forces judged the recommendation to have \u201chigh certainty\u201d of benefit, based on the available evidence.",
      "A 2010 paper from the American Dental Association recommended supplemental fluoride for children up to 16 years old who are at high risk of cavities. The recommendation was based on a review of studies across different age groups. The most common side effect associated with the products is spotting or discoloration of the teeth, caused by extra fluoride.",
      "The FDA regulates most dental products, including fluoride-containing toothpastes, supplements, mouthwashes and rinses.",
      "In recent weeks those products have increasingly been targeted with lawsuits and legal actions.",
      "Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation into the marketing of fluoride toothpastes by Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble. A press release from his office described the companies' promotions as \u201cmisleading, deceptive and dangerous.\u201d",

It asks cities and counties to provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter before clearing an encampment.",
      "Organizations representing California's cities and counties balked at the suggestion that they are to blame for street conditions. They say they need dedicated, sustained funding over multiple years for permanent projects instead of sporadic, one-time funding.",
      "Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities, said that eight in 10 cities have policies to address encampments but they need money to address the root causes of homelessness, such as more housing.",
      "The California State Association of Counties said the state has not provided as much money to address homelessness as it says it has and that half of the money has gone to housing developers.",
      "Studies have shown that encampment bans and other punitive measures make it even harder for people to find stable housing and work, said Alex Visotzky with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.",
      "People may lose critical documents or lose contact with a trusted case manager, forcing them to start all over again.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J.

      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",

      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",

      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",

      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",

If expelled, he could return to Brazil within hours or days, depending on arrangements between both countries. If a formal extradition process is required, it may take longer, depending on Bolivian judicial procedures.",

      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says that the Vatican can be a venue for Russia-Ukraine peace talks",
      "ROME -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Saturday that the Vatican could be a venue for Russia-Ukraine peace talks, taking up the Holy See\u2019s longstanding offer after Pope Leo XIV vowed to personally make \u201cevery effort\u201d to help end the war.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Rome before meeting with Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, the Vatican point man on Ukraine, Rubio said that he would be discussing potential ways the Vatican could help, \u201cthe status of the talks, the updates after yesterday (Friday) and the path forward.\u201d",
      "Asked if the Vatican could be a peace broker, Rubio replied: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it broker, but it\u2019s certainly \u2014 I think it\u2019s a place that both sides would be comfortable going.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019ll talk about all of that and obviously always grateful to the Vatican for their willingness to play this constructive and positive role,\u201d said Rubio, who also met Saturday with the Vatican secretary of state and foreign minister.",
      "The Vatican has a tradition of diplomatic neutrality and had long offered its services, and venues, to try to help facilitate talks, but found itself sidelined during the all-out war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Pope Francis, who occasionally angered both Kyiv and Moscow with his off-the-cuff comments, had entrusted Zuppi with a mandate to try to find paths of peace. But the mandate seemed to narrow to help facilitate the return of Ukrainian children taken by Russia, and the Holy See also was able to mediate some prisoner exchanges.",
      "During their meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, Rubio thanked Zuppi for the Vatican's humanitarian role, citing in particular prisoner swaps and the return of Ukrainian children. Rubio \u201cemphasized the importance of continued collaboration under the new leadership of Pope Leo XIV,\u201d U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.",
      "Leo, who was elected history\u2019s first American pope on May 8, took up Francis\u2019 call for peace in Ukraine in his first Sunday noon blessing as pope. He appealed for all sides to do whatever possible to reach \u201can authentic, just and lasting peace.\u201d",
      "Leo, who as a bishop in Peru had called Russia's war an \u201cimperialist invasion,\" vowed this week personally to \u201cmake every effort so that this peace may prevail.\u201d",
      "In a speech to eastern rite Catholics, including the Greek Catholic Church of Ukraine, Leo begged warring sides to meet and negotiate.",
      "\u201cThe Holy See is always ready to help bring enemies together, face to face, to talk to one another, so that peoples everywhere may once more find hope and recover the dignity they deserve, the dignity of peace,\u201d he said.",
      "The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, repeated the Vatican\u2019s offer to serve as a venue for direct talks, saying the failure of negotiations in Istanbul to reach a ceasefire this week was \u201ctragic.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had hoped it could start a process, slow but positive, toward a peaceful solution to the conflict,\u201d Parolin said on the sidelines of a conference. \u201cBut instead we\u2019re back to the beginning.\u201d",
      "Asked concretely what such an offer would entail, Parolin said that the Vatican could serve as a venue for a direct meeting between the two sides.",
      "\u201cOne would aim to arrive at this, that at least they talk. We\u2019ll see what happens. It\u2019s an offer of a place,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe have always said, repeated to the two sides that we are available to you, with all the discretion needed,\u201d Parolin said.",
      "The Vatican scored what was perhaps its greatest diplomatic achievement of the Francis pontificate when it facilitated the talks between the United States and Cuba in 2014 that resulted in the resumption of diplomatic relations.",
      "The Holy See has also often hosted far less secret diplomatic initiatives, such as when it brought together the rival leaders of South Sudan in 2019. The encounter was made famous by the image of Francis bending down to kiss their feet to beg them to make peace.",
      "Perhaps the Holy See's most critical diplomatic initiative came during the peak of the Cuban missile crisis when, in the fall of 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev ordered a secret deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba that were soon detected by U.S. spy planes.",
      "As the Kennedy administration considered its response, with the threat of nuclear war looming, Pope John XXIII pleaded for peace in a public radio address, in a speech to Vatican ambassadors and also wrote privately to Kennedy and Khruschev, appealing to their love of their people to stand down.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A Russian drone struck a passenger bus in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Sumy region on Saturday, killing nine people and injuring four others, Ukrainian officials said. The attack came just hours after Moscow and Kyiv held their first direct peace talks in years which failed to yield a ceasefire.",

      "The Associated Press could not independently verify details of the strike and there was no comment from Moscow.",

      "It wasn't immediately clear how the strike would affect peace efforts.",
      "On Friday, Russian and Ukrainian officials met in Turkey in an attempt to reach a temporary ceasefire, but the talks ended after less than two hours without a breakthrough. It was the first face-to-face dialogue between the two sides since the early weeks of Moscow\u2019s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "And while both sides agreed on a large prisoner swap, they clearly remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting.",
      "One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement. The Kremlin has pushed back against such a truce, which remains elusive.",

      "Madrid's international airport has for months been the site of homeless encampments amid a growing housing crisis in Spain, where rental costs have risen especially fast in the country's capital and also in Barcelona",
      "MADRID -- Every morning at 6 a.m., Teresa sets out in search of work, a shower and a bit of exercise before she returns home. For around six months, that has been Terminal 4 of Madrid\u2019s international airport.",
      "Teresa, 54, who didn\u2019t want her full name to be used because of safety concerns, is one of the estimated hundreds of homeless people sleeping in the Spanish capital\u2019s airport amid a growing housing crisis in Spain, where rental costs have risen especially fast in cities like Madrid, the country's capital, and Barcelona.",
      "She and others sleeping at Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid-Barajas Airport \u2014 the third-busiest airport in Europe in 2023, according to Eurostat \u2014 described a situation where for months, authorities have neither helped them find other living arrangements nor have they kicked them out from the corners of the airport that they have occupied with sleeping bags unfurled on the floor as well as blankets, shopping carts and bags.",
      "Soon, things could change.",
      "Spain\u2019s airport operator AENA this week said that it would start limiting who can enter Madrid\u2019s airport during low-travel hours by asking visitors to show their boarding passes. AENA said that the policy would take effect in the next few days, but didn't specify exactly when. It said that exceptions would be made for airport workers and anyone accompanying a traveler.",
      "Teresa, a Spanish-Ecuadorian who said she has lived in Spain for a quarter-century, told The Associated Press on Thursday that she hadn't heard of the new policy. She and her husband would be forced to sleep outside on park benches and other public spaces if they aren\u2019t allowed back in.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t make demands. We\u2019re squatters,\u201d Teresa said, using a controversial term common in Spain. \u201cSquatters in what is private property. We are aware of that. We want help from authorities, but not a single one has come here.\u201d",
      "For months, a political blame game between officials at different levels of government has meant that the homeless encampments in the airport have largely gone unaddressed. In recent weeks, videos on social media and news reports of the airport's homeless population put a spotlight on the issue.",
      "Madrid\u2019s city council on Thursday said that it had asked Spain\u2019s national government to take charge and come up with a plan to rehabilitate every homeless individual sleeping in the airport. Spanish airports are overseen by AENA, a state-owned publicly listed company. A city council spokesperson said that Madrid's city government had recently called for a meeting with officials from AENA, the regional government of Madrid and several national ministries that declined.",
      "\u201cWithout them, there is no possible solution,\u201d said Luc\u00eda Mart\u00edn, a spokesperson for Madrid\u2019s city council division of social policies, family and equality. She said that the national ministries of transport, interior, inclusion, social rights and health declined to participate in a working group.",
      "A day earlier, AENA accused Madrid\u2019s city authorities of providing inadequate help and said that the city government's statements about the unfolding situation confirmed its \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d and abandonment of the airport\u2019s homeless individuals.",
      "\u201cIt's like a dog chasing its tail,\u201d said Marta Cecilia C\u00e1rdenas of the long list of authorities she was told could help her. C\u00e1rdenas, a 58-year-old homeless woman originally from Colombia, said that she had spent several months sleeping in Madrid's airport.",
      "It\u2019s not known how many people are sleeping in Madrid\u2019s airport, through which 66 million travelers transited last year. Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds newspaper reported that a recent count taken by a charity group identified roughly 400 homeless people in the airport, many of whom, like Teresa, had previously lived in Madrid and were employed in some capacity.",
      "AP wasn't able to confirm that number. Madrid city council officials, meanwhile, said that the Spanish capital's social service teams had helped 94 individuals in April with ties to the city, 12 of whom were rehabilitated into municipal shelters, addiction treatment centers or independent living.",
      "Teresa said she had heard about sleeping in the airport by word of mouth. Before she lost her job, she said she lived in an apartment in Madrid\u2019s Legan\u00e9s neighborhood, earning a living taking care of older people.",
      "She currently earns 400 euros ($450) per month, working under the table caring for an older woman. With the earnings, Teresa said she maintains a storage unit in the neighborhood that she used to live in. Though the work is sporadic, she said it was still enough to also cover fees for the gym in which she showers daily, pay for transportation, and purchase food.",
      "Over the last decade, \u200bthe average rent in Spain has almost doubled, according to real estate website Idealista, with steeper increases in Madrid and Barcelona. Spain also has a smaller public housing stock than many other European Union countries.",
      "Teresa said that she hopes to find a job soon and leave the airport, whatever authorities may force her to do in the coming days and weeks. She and her husband keep to themselves, avoiding others sleeping in the brightly-lit hallway dotted with sleeping bags who were battling mental health problems, addiction and other issues, she said.",
      "\u201cYou end up adjusting to it a bit, accepting it even, but never getting used to it,\u201d Teresa said over the constant din of airline announcements. \u201cI hope to God that it gets better, because this is not life.\u201d",

      "Norwegian chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen is playing a single game against 140,000 people worldwide",
      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Norwegian grandmaster Magnus Carlsen is playing a single game of chess against 140,000 people worldwide in a mega-match that could overturn expectations by ending in a draw in the next few days.",
      "Billed as \u201cMagnus Carlsen vs. The World,\u201d the online match began April 4 on Chess.com, the world\u2019s largest chess website, and is the first-ever online freestyle game to feature a world champion.",
      "While Chess.com had predicted Carlsen would win by a wide margin, his Team World opposition could force a draw if it checks Carlsen\u2019s king three times.",
      "\u201cRight now we\u2019re heading towards a draw by perpetual check,\" Carlsen said in a statement on Friday. \u201cI felt that I was a little bit better, early in the opening, then maybe I didn\u2019t play that precisely. Honestly, since then, they haven\u2019t given me a single chance. So now, I think, it\u2019s just heading towards the draw.\u201d",
      "He added: \"Overall, \u2018the world\u2019 has played very, very sound chess from the start. Maybe not going for most enterprising options, but kind of keeping it more in vein with normal chess -- which isn\u2019t always the best strategy, but it worked out well this time,\u201d",
      "As a freestyle match, the bishops, knights, rooks, queen and king are randomly shuffled around the board while the pawns remain in their usual spots. Freestyle chess is popular because it allows players to be more creative and avoid memorization.",
      "Team World votes on each move, and each side has 24 hours to make their play. Carlsen is playing the white pieces.",
      "\u201cFor most of the world, it is their first chance to say they\u2019ve played a chess game against Magnus Carlsen,\u201d Mike Klein, senior journalist with Chess.com, told The Associated Press. \u201cI think \u2018the world\u2019 is going to be kind of tickled pink to be able to say, \u2019I was part of a draw against Magnus Carlsen.\u2019\u201d",
      "Klein has played, and lost, to Carlsen twice in blitz matches in a hotel bar when the Norwegian was bored during some downtime in a world championship.",
      "\u201cHe beat me twice without much effort, so I would have happily signed up for a draw in any of those games,\u201d Klein said.",
      "A grandmaster at 13, Carlsen enjoys celebrity status that few other chess players have.",
      "The 34-year-old became the world\u2019s top-ranked player in 2011 and has won five World Championships. He achieved the highest-ever chess rating of 2882 in 2014 and has remained the undisputed world number one for more than a decade.",
      "Last year, he garnered headlines for quitting a tournament in New York after refusing to change out of the jeans he wore to the competition. He later accepted a $200 fine and officials agreed to loosen the dress code.",
      "Carlsen auctioned the jeans off for charity and donated the winning $36,100 bid to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, a national youth-mentoring charity that carries out its mission through local chapters across 5,000 communities nationwide.",
      "This is the third \u201cvs. The World\u201d record-setting online game.",
      "In 1999, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov played against more than 50,000 people on the Microsoft Network.",
      "A few top-ranked players helped steer the world's moves, but Kasparov won after four months and hailed it as \u201cthe greatest game in the history of chess.\u201d",
      "Klein was a summer camp chess teacher at the time. \u201cWe would start class each day by checking out Kasparov\u2019s next move and talking about it and spending a few minutes each morning deciding what we\u2019d reply.\u201d",
      "Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand won his \u201cvs. The World\u201d match last year against nearly 70,000 players on Chess.com.",
      "The goal of the Carlsen match was to break Anand\u2019s 70,000-player mark, and ended up doubling it.",

      "The veneration of Virgin Mary is central to Catholics, from popes to the ordinary faithful",
      "GENAZZANO, Italy -- Pope Leo XIV closed his first public blessing as pontiff with a Hail Mary, after invoking the feast day of Our Lady of Pompei. On his first papal trip, he went to the Sanctuary of Our Mother of Good Counsel in the medieval village of Genazzano and on the drive back stopped to pray by Pope Francis\u2019 tomb in the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome.",
      "That\u2019s just three of a myriad Virgin Marys around the world, whose veneration is central to Catholics from the pope to the ordinary faithful. Even many of the less-than-devout know what it means to throw a Hail Mary.",
      "The month of May is dedicated to Marian celebrations, so here\u2019s a look at the history and traditions about Mary and why praying to her means so much to so many.",
      "According to the Gospel, Mary is the mother of Jesus \u2014 and the mystery of the incarnation of the son of God through her is central to Christian dogma.",
      "The oldest title for Mary is precisely \u201cmother of God,\u201d or Theotokos in the original Greek. It was chosen after heated theological debate in the first centuries of Christianity.",
      "St. Mary Major is the oldest still-standing sanctuary dedicated to that, said Giuseppa Falanga, professor of liturgy at Pontificia Universita della Santa Croce in Rome. It was built on one of Rome\u2019s hills in the 5th century \u2014 according to tradition, because of the pope\u2019s dream and an August snowfall there on what is now also celebrated as the day of Our Lady of the Snows.",
      "There are three major categories of titles for Mary \u2014 first, those related to dogma and major events in her life.",
      "The Assumption on Aug. 15, for instance, celebrates Mary being taken body and soul into heaven. It's marked by Masses and religious festivals but also the peak of summer holidays for faithful and atheists alike in countries such as Italy and Greece, where all but the most essential work grinds to a halt on that feast day.",
      "Then there are titles related to apparitions. In December, millions gather in Mexico, and across the Americas, to celebrate the Virgin of Guadalupe who, according to church tradition, appeared to an Indigenous man in 1531. Millions more visit the sanctuaries in Fatima, Portugal, and in Lourdes, France, other sites of apparitions in the past few centuries.",
      "And then there are titles based on what pilgrims and faithful want \u2014 from Good Counsel to protection (the many \u201cGuard\u201d Marys ) to Star of the Sea, invoked by seafarers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like there\u2019s a Mary for everything,\u201d said Kayla Harris, professor and director of Marian Library at University of Dayton in Ohio.",
      "It\u2019s also why the rosary is one of the most widely used prayers \u2014 including publicly for the pope \u2014 and why popular devotions to the Virgin Mary, including processions and festivals, are so central to Christianity, Falanga said.",
      "How Mary is represented, however, varies greatly across time and places, Harris added.",
      "There are \u201cBlack\u201d Virgin Marys \u2014 dark-skinned paintings and statues like Brazil\u2019s much beloved Virgin of Aparecida. In rare icons, she\u2019s represented pregnant or as an older woman.",
      "She\u2019s either portrayed alone or, most often, holding the baby Jesus, as in the Genazzano 15th century painting, a close-up of the two faces with Jesus' fingers holding his mother\u2019s neck. Mary looking at Jesus makes a theological point, too \u2014 inviting worshippers to fix their gaze on Christ, not her.",
      "In fact, according to the Catechism, Catholics are to give Mary special veneration, but not worship her \u2014 something reserved for God alone, Falanga said.",
      "It\u2019s that relatability as a mother figure that makes Mary so universally appealing as an intercessor before God, Harris said.",
      "Since the 19th century, May has been devoted to the Virgin Mary \u2014 though already in Greek and Roman times, goddesses of fertility were celebrated in this month of springtime blooming, she added.",
      "Mother\u2019s Day is also celebrated in May in many countries, including Italy and the United States \u2014 and it coincided with Leo\u2019s first public Sunday blessing at noon, a time for another traditional daily invocation to the Virgin Mary.",
      "Two mothers who went to morning Mass on a recent weekday at the Genazzano chapel \u2014 where the Mary icon stands \u2014 said they pray their children, ranging in age from 18 to 24, will keep the faith.",
      "\u201cThe Madonna has been holding my hand since I was a child,\u201d said Anastasia Galizia, who grew up in the village and witnessed Leo\u2019s visit. \u201cI ask her how to love her son and I pray for conversion, for me, for my family and for the whole world.\"",
      "At the Basilica of St. Augustine in Rome, which is served by Augustinians \u2014 Leo\u2019s religious order \u2014 there are two popular prayer spots for mothers. One is a sculpture known as the \u201cLabor Madonna\u201d where expecting mothers go; the other is a chapel with the relics of St. Monica, St. Augustine\u2019s mother, who prayed incessantly for his conversion.",
      "\u201cWe welcome a lot of moms, who come to pray to St. Monica for their children, who have walked away from the faith, and they ask the Lord for the gift to touch their hearts,\u201d said the Rev. Pasquale Cormio, the basilica\u2019s rector.",

    "story": [
      "Young men who once lived the \u201cgangster life\u201d in Kenya's capital have become farmers with a social mission",
      "MATHARE, Kenya -- Joseph Kariaga and his friends once lived the \u201cgangster life\u201d in Nairobi\u2019s Mathare slum, snatching phones, mugging people and battling police. But when Kariaga's brother was shot dead by police, the young men took stock.",
      "\u201cWe said, 'We cannot live like this. We are going to lose our lives.\u2019 Many of our friends had died,\u201d said Kariaga, now 27. \u201cI reflected on my life. I had to change.\u201d",
      "Now the men are farmers with a social mission. Nearly a dozen of them founded Vision Bearerz in 2017 to steer youth away from crime and address food insecurity in one of Kenya\u2019s poorest communities.",
      "Despite challenges, Vision Bearerz makes a modest but meaningful community impact, including feeding over 150 children at lunches each week. Some residents praise the group and call the men role models.",
      "Amid cuts to foreign funding by the United States and others, experts say local organizations like this may be the future of aid.",
      "Vision Bearerz works on an urban farm tucked away in the muddy streets and corrugated-metal homes that make up Mathare, one of Africa's most populous slums. Estimates say about a half-million people live in this neighborhood of less than two square kilometers.",
      "Some 2 million people, or 60% of Nairobi\u2019s population, live in informal settlements, according to CFK Africa, a non-governmental organization that runs health and poverty reduction programs in such neighborhoods and is familiar with Vision Bearerz' work.",
      "Lack of infrastructure is a key challenge in these communities, which are growing amid sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s rapid urbanization and booming youth population, said Jeffrey Okoro, the group\u2019s executive director.",
      "Poverty pushes youth into crime, Okoro added.",
      "\u201cMost folks in slums such as Mathare are not able to earn enough to buy a decent meal, and kids who are under 5 are twice as likely to be malnourished,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the other major challenges affecting young people is gangs, and the promise of making a quick buck.\u201d",
      "The farmers of Vision Bearerz know this well.",
      "\u201cWhen you are born from this land, there is not much you have inherited, so you have to make it yourself,\u201d said Ben Njoki, 28, whose face tattoos are reminders of a gang-affiliated past. \u201cYou have to use violence.\u201d",
      "In 2017, not long after Kariaga\u2019s brother was killed, Njoki and other young men made a plan to change. More than a dozen people they grew up with had been killed, and they realized they would follow if they did not find an alternative to crime, said Moses Nyoike, 32, the chair of Vision Bearerz.",
      "To keep busy, the group began collecting garbage and would split profits from trading vegetables, buying produce in another county and reselling it locally. They noticed a gap in the supply of vegetables to Mathare, and with permission from authorities they cleaned up a garbage dump and began planting.",
      "Polluted soil, and water rationing, made it a tough start. Then, inspired by a TikTok account that showcased farming in a Colombian slum, Vision Bearerz tried their hand at hydroponics. With the help of an NGO that supports community enterprises, Growth4Change, they were able to get materials and training in urban farming methods.",
      "Today, Vision Bearerz grows vegetables, raises pigs and farms tilapia in a small pond. They sell a portion of what they produce, with revenue also coming from running a car wash and public toilet.",
      "With the earnings, the group buys maize flour to make ugali, a dough-like staple food, and beans, which supplement produce from their farm in weekly lunches for children.",
      "Vision Bearerz also runs outreach programs to warn against drug use and crime, and has sessions where women teach girls about feminine health.",
      "\u201cThe life I was living was a lie. It didn\u2019t add up to anything. We just lost people. Now, we are winning people in the community,\u201d Njoki said.",
      "Davis Gichere, 28, another founding member, called the work therapeutic.",
      "Challenges remain. Joining Vision Bearerz requires a pledge to leave crime behind, and there have been instances of recidivism, with at least one member arrested. Lingering criminal reputations have led to police harassment in the past, and finding money to buy food for Saturday feedings is a weekly struggle.",
      "Funding cuts across the development space, including the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development, make the prospect of new financing dim.",
      "At least one other group in Nairobi\u2019s Kibera slum, Human Needs Project, does similar work of urging youth away from crime and addressing food insecurity through urban farming.",
      "It's a model that can be scaled up or copied elsewhere, said Okoro of CFK Africa.",
      "\u201cThe future of development is locally led organizations,\" he said, noting they are best suited to understanding the needs of their communities.",
      "Kariaga still feels the pain of his brother\u2019s death, but is proud of his new job.",
      "\u201cFarming can change the world,\u201d he said, a silver-capped tooth glinting in the sun.",

      "Ukrainian officials and analysts say Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has few options but to draw U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s ire against Vladimir Putin, while depending on Europe\u2019s support",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since U.S.-brokered talks began in March, Ukraine\u2019s strategy has been to convince the Trump administration that Vladimir Putin is unreliable and that Kyiv is serious about peace.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has few options, analysts and officials say, but to draw U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s ire against Putin, while depending on Europe\u2019s united and stalwart support.",
      "In the latest round, Zelenskyy not only accepted Putin's offer to hold direct talks in Turkey, after the U.S. endorsed the idea, but raised the stakes and challenged the Russian leader to a face-to-face. The gesture failed to move Putin and the Istanbul talks were demoted to a technical meeting Friday that failed to yield substantial results on ending the war.",
      "The U.S. has expressed frustration with the stalled talks and threatened to withdraw if results aren\u2019t achieved. On Friday, Trump told reporters after boarding Air Force One to return to Washington from Abu Dhabi that he may call Putin soon.",
      "\u201cHe and I will meet, and I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAt least we\u2019ll know. And if we don\u2019t solve it, it\u2019ll be very interesting.\u201d",
      "All along, Zelenskyy's message, directed at the Trump administration, has been: The Russian leader cannot be trusted.",
      "It's a rhetorical game of pingpong in which both Kyiv and Moscow try to outmaneuver the other vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. But the political theatrics are underscored by stark realities on the ground. In this war of attrition against Russia's invasion, Ukraine\u2019s position is poised to grow weaker as time goes on, unless powerful sanctions are imposed against Moscow and the U.S. continues arms deliveries.",
      "\u201cHe is in a difficult situation because behind him is a whole nation of people who are suffering,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezkho, a lawmaker in Zelenskyy\u2019s party. \u201cWe are playing (along), we are trying to do everything we can because we don\u2019t want to lose the support of the U.S. We don\u2019t want to be accused that it was our fault.\u201d",
      "Putin\u2019s no-show did not result in a strong reaction from Trump, which frustrated Ukrainian officials.",
      "\u201cIt looks surreal, weird when Ukraine is complying to everything required from us, and Putin ignores, rejects,\u201d said Merezhko. \u201cIt looks very imbalanced, it looks unfair for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Since March, Zelenskyy has made a point of showing Ukraine's willingness to acquiesce to U.S. demands to avoid alienating Trump, his most powerful ally.",
      "Kyiv hoped Russia\u2019s unwillingness to do the same would, in time, provoke the U.S. to unleash powerful sanctions and cripple Moscow\u2019s war machine \u2014 the most likely scenario in which Ukraine can hope to weaken Russia and negotiate an advantageous peace deal, analysts said.",
      "Russia\u2019s position has remained mostly consistent. The Kremlin kept repeating that it was ready for peace talks with Ukraine \u2014 while making demands that were politically untenable for Zelenskyy, and would require Ukraine to make territorial concessions, neutralize its army and vow never to join NATO.",
      "Throughout the war, Moscow has also accused Kyiv and its Western allies of seeking to prolong the fighting and derailing peace efforts.",
      "Most recently, the Kremlin pushed back against a proposed 30-day ceasefire, countering with two brief unilateral ones, and then accused Ukraine of failing to stop the fighting, painting it as unwilling to silence the guns. At the same time, Russian officials underscore the effort to resolve the conflict is complex.",
      "\u201cWe understand that Washington wants to achieve quick success in this process, but at the same time we hope that there is an understanding that the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis is too complicated, there are many questions and details that need to be addressed before the settlement,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters last month.",
      "Ukraine is asking for an unconditional temporary ceasefire, during which time future diplomatic talks can take shape. Zelenskyy also asked for a trust-building gesture, such as the release of prisoners of war, something the two sides agreed to Friday. The exchange of 1,000 prisoners would be their largest swap yet.",
      "But Ukraine has also maintained flexibility in its negotiating position by accepting Trump's proposals to avoid alienating the U.S. president.",
      "\u201cThey're desperate to keep the Americans on their side,\u201d said Balazs Jarabik, an analyst specializing in Eastern Europe and Ukraine.",
      "In March, Kyiv agreed to the U.S. proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire, which Putin effectively rejected by imposing conditions impossible for Ukraine. In April, Kyiv signed a landmark minerals deal sought by Trump after months of fraught negotiations and a brief pause in military aid.",
      "That is why agreeing to send a delegation to Istanbul, after Trump supported the idea, was a risky move for Zelenskyy. It played into Putin\u2019s aim of drawing Kyiv into talks that had been stalled since the early weeks of Moscow's 2022 invasion.",
      "\u201cWe showed that we are for peace negotiations and support Trump\u2019s plan,\" said Mykola Davydiuk, a Ukrainian political scientist. \u201cNow the ball is with Trump.\u201d",
      "Despite verbal threats from Europe and the U.S., sanctions of the kind that could devastate Russia\u2019s energy sector have not been forthcoming.",
      "Zelenskyy has expressed support for a sanctions package pushed in the U.S. Congress by Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham that could impose 500% tariffs on Russian energy imports. Graham has said he has enough support in the House to bring the sanctions bill to the floor.",
      "For now, Zelenskyy has few options but to continue to highlight Putin\u2019s disinclination to engage in meaningful talks and keep the U.S. engaged.",
      "\u201cIf it turns out that the Russian delegation really is just theatrical and can\u2019t deliver any results today, the world must respond,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said at a European summit in Albania on Friday. \u201cThere needs to be a strong reaction, including sanctions against Russia\u2019s energy sector and banks. Pressure must continue to rise until real progress is made.\u201d",
      "For Ukrainian soldiers fighting along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line the theatricality of the week\u2019s political developments stood in harsh contrast with the grinding war.",
      "\u201cBetter to call it a circus,\u201d said a Ukrainian drone operator with the 68th brigade who, like other soldiers, gave only his call sign Goose in line with military protocol.",
      "Analysts say Russia is at a crucial crossroads in the war, where it can negotiate a truce and consolidate gains, or launch a summer military campaign to maximize wins before the onset of winter.",
      "Ukraine has always been at a disadvantage and faces manpower and ammunition shortages. Analysts have offered estimates of six months to two years for how much longer it can hang on.",
      "Much will depend on what kind of support Ukraine receives from partners and how quickly the country can scale up domestic weapons production.",
      "Russian forces recently intensified offensive operations in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, according to Ukraine\u2019s Southern Defense Forces spokesperson. Soldiers said Russia has a clear aim of reaching the borders of the Dnipropetrovsk region, to be able to claim the capture of two out of four partially occupied territories.",
      "\u201cThe feeling is that we will either hold out and allow the political leadership of the country to freeze the conflict along the contact line, or the enemy will break through,\u201d said a Ukrainian soldier with the call sign Corsair Denis in the Sumy region.",

      "LA PAZ, BOLIVIA -- Hundreds of supporters of ex-President Evo Morales marched toward Bolivia's top electoral court on Friday to push for their leftist leader's candidacy in presidential elections later this year, a rally that descended into street clashes as police tried to clear out a group of demonstrators.",
      "The confrontations come in response to a ruling by Bolivia\u2019s Constitutional Court that blocks Morales, the nation's first Indigenous president who governed from 2006 until his ouster in 2019, from running again in Aug. 17 elections. The turmoil escalates political tensions as Bolivia undergoes its worst economic crisis in four decades.",
      "As the march arrived in Bolivia\u2019s capital of La Paz, protesters seeking to register Morales\u2019 candidacy surged toward the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, chanting, \u201cComrades, what do we want? For Evo to come back!\u201d",
      "Security forces barricading a road to the court held them back. Police reported that the clashes between rock-throwing protesters and tear gas-lobbing police forces injured two officers, a journalist and a local merchant.",
      "\"They're using firecrackers and rocks that are hurting our forces,\" said police Commander Juan Russo. \u201cThis is not a peaceful march.\u201d",
      "The authorities did not report on any injuries among the protesters, who were seen being pushed onto the ground, shoved into police cars and blasted with tear gas.",
      "The court's unanimous decision Wednesday upheld an earlier ruling that bans presidents from serving more than two terms. Morales has already served three, and, in 2019, resigned under pressure from the military and went into exile as protests erupted over his bid for an unprecedented fourth term.",
      "Morales returned to Bolivia a year later as the 2020 elections vaulted to power his preferred candidate, President Luis Arce, from his long-dominant Movement Toward Socialism party.",
      "Arce, who announced earlier this week that he would not seek re-election, insisted that the Constitutional Court had disqualified Morales, his mentor-turned-rival, from running in 2025.",
      "But many experts doubt the legitimacy of that decision in a country where political conflicts undermine the courts and presidents have maneuvered to get their allies on the bench.",
      "\u201cThe Constitutional Court issues unconstitutional arbitrary rulings at the whim of those in power,\u201d said Morales, who himself reaped the benefits of favorable judges while seeking to run for a fourth consecutive term in 2017.",
      "After Morales lost a referendum seeking to do away with term limits while still in power, the Constitutional Court ruled it would be against Morales\u2019 human rights to stop him from running for another term.",
      "That 2017 ruling allows Morales to register his candidacy, said Oscar Hassentoufel, the president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. \u201cThen the tribunal will decide whether he's eligible or not.\u201d",
      "In defiance of the latest court ruling, Morales called a mass march that marshaled his loyal supporters in the rural tropics. They long have championed the Indigenous coca-grower for transforming the country during his tenure \u2014 redistributing Bolivia\u2019s natural gas wealth and seeking greater inclusion for its Indigenous majority.",
      "Holed up in his stronghold for fear of arrest on human trafficking charges that he claims are politically motivated, Morales did not attend the march.",
      "The government confirmed that fear on Friday. \u201cWe ask Mr. Morales to surrender voluntarily,\u201d said Eduardo del Castillo, a senior minister. \"If we find him walking the streets, we will arrest him.\u201d",
      "Instead, scores of his supporters walked the capital's streets on Friday wearing masks of Morales' face.",
      "\u201cEvo Morales is each and every one of us. If they want to detain Evo Morales they would need to take every one of us, too,\u201d said David Ochoa, a representative of the marchers.",

      "PANAMA CITY -- Dozens of boats carrying around 200 people, mostly farmers waving Panamanian flags, traveled along the country's central Indio River on Friday to protest a planned reservoir in the Panama Canal intended to solve water shortages in the waterway that have threatened international trade flow.",
      "The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) says building the reservoir is the best way to provide an additional water source for over 2 million people in Panama City and to ensure the canal operates efficiently in the coming decades.",
      "The canal, which needs around 189 million liters (50 million gallons) of freshwater for each ship crossing, faced severe water shortages in 2023 due to lack of rain, forcing authorities to cut crossings by 20% and delay traffic. The proposed reservoir, which would take four years and $1.6 billion to build, could allow 12 to 13 more ship crossings per day and support new water treatment facilities being built, authorities say.",
      "But protesters say building the reservoir using the Indio River, in the canal's watershed, would also force 2,000 people to be relocated from their homes because their communities would be flooded. Other areas downstream could also be affected by reduced river flow.",
      "Iris Gallardo, a teacher from the Guasimo community and a member of the \u201cNo to Reservoirs\u201d movement, was among the group of mostly farmers waving Panamanian flags. She told the Associated Press they held the boat protest to show their rejection of the project and forced relocations.",
      "\u201cWe are demanding that the multipurpose reservoir proposed by the ACP not be built without consulting and getting permission from the affected communities,\u201d Gallardo said.",
      "Instead, protestors suggest using the nearby Bayano Lake, located east of the capital. Authorities dismissed that idea due to logistical, legal challenges and cost, and said that such a project would displace 200,000 people \u2013 far more than the current plan. They said the project would also offer jobs to communities and that the resettlement plan is being developed with the community.",
      "Former Panama Canal administrator Jorge Luis Quijano said opponents of the project don\u2019t understand how serious the water problem is.",

      "Petroperu told AP in a written statement that several companies were interested in Block 64 but withdrew at the last minute due to internal strategic shifts, not external pressure.",
      "The company denied that Indigenous opposition played a role, asserting that local communities support oil development and are urging operations to begin. It also said that the block has the required community approval \u2014 known as a social license \u2014 which is seen as crucial for multinational oil and gas projects to proceed without conflict.",
      "Since 1995, Indigenous groups have strongly opposed oil development in the area, blocking multiple companies due to environmental and rights concerns. In 2022, Petroperu took control of Block 64, which known as an oil concession where the government has granted rights to explore and extract oil within a specific territory.",
      "\u00a8It's been a fight ever since the Peruvian state granted the concession without consultation or consent (from Indigenous communities),\u00a8 Bisa Tirko said. \u00a8For more than 25 years, we have been fighting and resisting to defend our right to live in a healthy and balanced environment.\u00a8",

He said that pollution from other oil blocks has harmed other communities in the Amazon.",
      "\"The history of their sister Indigenous communities in neighboring oil blocks is poisoned water sources, social division and impoverishment,\" Miller said. \u201cEach day the oil doesn\u2019t flow is a day they can still use the rivers for their sustenance, as they always have.\u201d",
      "Miller says despite multinational companies having invested tens of millions of dollars in past attempts to develop Block 64, none have seen a return, suggesting the industry now sees it as a costly financial dead end. Despite this, he believes the Peruvian government will keep searching for a way to encourage development of Block 64.",

      "Kolluri spoke Saturday at Newark's Broad Street Station, saying the agency is preparing for the workweek commute by \u201csurging\u201d buses to help commuters at train stations. But he cautioned that the buses can't handle the entire volume of the commuter rail system.",
      "Kolluri said he and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen President Mark Wallace spoke and agreed to meet Saturday. It had been uncertain whether the two sides would meet ahead of a National Mediation Board meeting already set for Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to meet the union today. We\u2019re going to meet them tomorrow, with this goal of getting to a deal so we can get them back to work, get our customers the reliable service they need,\u201d Kolluri said.",
      "A message seeking comment Saturday was left with the union.",
      "The walkout comes after the latest round of negotiations on Thursday didn\u2019t produce an agreement. It is the state\u2019s first transit strike in more than 40 years and comes a month after union members overwhelmingly rejected a labor agreement with management.",
      "Wallace walked the picket line Friday outside New York City\u2019s Penn Station, and said the engineers are committed to staying on strike until they get a fair deal. Union members were nearly unanimous in authorizing a strike last summer, and 87% of them rejected the latest agreement.",
      "Wallace said NJ Transit needs to pay engineers a wage that\u2019s comparable to Amtrak and Long Island Railroad because engineers are leaving for jobs on those other railroads for better pay,",
      "The union has seen steady attrition in its ranks at NJ Transit as more members leave to take better-paying jobs at other railroads.

      "A federal judge in Texas struck down guidance from a government agency specifying protections against workplace harassment based on gender identity and sexual orientation",
      "A federal judge in Texas struck down guidance from a government agency specifying protections against workplace harassment based on gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Thursday determined that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission exceeded its statutory authority when the agency issued guidance to employers against deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, and barring employees from wearing dress code-compliant clothing according to their gender identity because they may constitute forms of workplace harassment.",
      "Kacsmaryk said the guidance is \u201cinconsistent with the text, history, and tradition of Title VII and recent Supreme Court precedent.\u201d",
      "Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects employees and job applicants from employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.",
      "The EEOC, which enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws, had updated its guidance on workplace harassment in April of last year under President Joe Biden for the first time in 25 years. It followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",
      "Texas and the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, in August challenged the guidance, which the agency says serves as a tool for employers to assess compliance with anti-discrimination laws and is not legally binding. Kacsmaryk disagreed, writing that the guidance creates \u201cmandatory standards ... from which legal consequences will necessarily flow if an employer fails to comply.\u201d",
      "The decision marks the latest blow to workplace protections for transgender workers following President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Kacsmaryk, a 2017 Trump nominee, invalidated all portions of the EEOC guidance that defines \u201csex\u201d to include \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity,\u201d along with an entire section addressing the subject.",
      "\u201cTitle VII does not require employers or courts to blind themselves to the biological differences between men and women,\u201d he wrote in the opinion.",
      "Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts commended the decision in an emailed statement: \u201cThe Biden EEOC tried to compel businesses \u2014 and the American people \u2014 to deny basic biological truth. Today, thanks to the great state of Texas and the work of my Heritage colleagues, a federal judge said: not so fast.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis ruling is more than a legal victory. It\u2019s a cultural one. It says no \u2014 you don\u2019t have to surrender common sense at the altar of leftist ideology. You don\u2019t have to pretend men are women. And you don\u2019t have to lie to keep your job. \u201d",
      "The National Women\u2019s Law Center, which filed an amicus brief in November in support of the harassment guidance, blasted the decision in an emailed statement.",
      "\u201cThe district court\u2019s decision is an outrage and blatantly at odds with Supreme Court precedent,\u201d said Liz Theran, senior director of litigation for education and workplace justice at NWLC. \u201cThe EEOC\u2019s Harassment Guidance reminds employers and workers alike to do one simple thing that should cost no one anything: refrain from degrading others on the job based on their identity and who they love. This decision does not change the law, but it will make it harder for LGBTQIA+ workers to enforce their rights and experience a workplace free from harassment.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice and the EEOC declined to comment on the outcome of the case.",
      "The EEOC in fiscal year 2024 received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and 3,000-plus in 2023, according to the agency\u2019s website.",

      "There's more muddle now to an issue that has split the photographic community",
      "An organization that honored The Associated Press' Nick Ut with its \u201c photo of the year \u201d in 1973 for a picture of a girl running from a napalm attack in the Vietnam War says it has \u201csuspended its attribution\u201d to Ut because of doubts over who actually took it.",
      "World Press Photo's report Friday adds to the muddle over an issue that has split the photographic community since a movie earlier this year, \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d questioned Ut's authorship. The photo of a naked and terrified Kim Phuc became an iconic symbol of the war's tragedy.",
      "After two investigations, The Associated Press said it found no definitive evidence to warrant stripping Ut's photo credit. The AP said it was possible Ut took the picture, but the passage of time made it impossible to fully prove, and could find no evidence to prove anyone else did.",
      "World Press Photo said its probe found that two other photographers \u2014 Nguyen Thanh Nghe, the man mentioned in \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d and Huynh Cong Phuc \u2014 \u201cmay have been better positioned\u201d to take the shot.",
      "\u201cWe conclude that the level of doubt is too significant to maintain the existing attribution,\u201d said Joumana El Zein Khoury, executive director of World Press Photo. \u201cAt the same time, lacking conclusive evidence pointing definitively to another photographer, we cannot reassign authorship, either.\u201d",
      "World Press Photo, an organization whose awards are considered influential in photography, won't attempt to recover the cash award given to Ut, a spokeswoman said.",
      "Ut's lawyer, James Hornstein, said his client hadn't spoken to World Press Photo after some initial contact before \u201cThe Stringer\u201d was released. \u201cIt seems they had already made up their mind to punish Nick Ut from the start,\u201d he said.",
      "Gary Knight, a producer of \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d is a four-time judge of the World Press Photo awards and a consultant to the World Press Photo Foundation.",
      "The AP said Friday that its standards \u201crequire proof and certainty to remove a credit and we have found that it is impossible to prove exactly what happened that day on the road or in the (AP) bureau over 50 years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe understand World Press Photo has taken different action based on the same available information, and that is their prerogative,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is no question over AP's ownership of the photo.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Pulitzer Prize that Ut won for the photo appears safe. The Pulitzers depend on news agencies who enter the awards to determine authorship, and administrator Marjorie Miller \u2014 a former AP senior editor \u2014 pointed to the AP\u2019s study showing insufficient proof to withdraw credit. \u201cThe board does not anticipate future action at this time,\u201d she said Friday.",

      "Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe wants his state to help with a renovated or new stadium for pro football's Chiefs and with a new home venue for baseball's Royals. A Kansas law enacted last year authorizes state bonds for 70% of the cost of a new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales, and new sales and alcohol taxes.",
      "Voters in Jackson County, Missouri, where the teams are located, encouraged Kansas officials to make a play for the teams by turning down a sales tax extension last year that would have helped finance a new, $2 billion ballpark district for the Royals and an $800 million renovation of the Chiefs\u2019 Arrowhead Stadium.",

      "The GOP-controlled Missouri House approved a Kehoe-backed bill Tuesday that would have allowed the state to issue bonds for up to half the cost of the stadium projects and allow tax credits of up to $50 million. But the Republican-controlled Senate abruptly ended its regular-session work Wednesday after a contentious fight over an anti-abortion measure, without taking up the stadium financing measure.",
      "At least a few Kansas and Missouri lawmakers from both parties are skeptical of state incentives. Many economists contend that public funding for stadiums isn\u2019t worth it, because sports tend to divert discretionary spending away from other forms of entertainment rather than generate new income.",

      "Between collections resuming, courts challenging student loan programs and layoffs in the Education Department, borrowers might be confused about the status their student loans",
      "NEW YORK -- Between collections resuming, courts blocking student loan programs and layoffs at the Education Department, borrowers might be confused about the status of their student loans.",
      "Recently, the Education Department announced it would start involuntary collections on defaulted loans, meaning the roughly 5.3 million borrowers who are in default could have their wages garnished by the federal government.",
      "At the center of the turmoil are the government's income-driven repayment plans, which reduce monthly payments for borrowers with lower incomes. Those plans were temporarily paused after a federal court blocked parts of the plans in February.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much confusion, they\u2019ve made it very complicated,\u201d said Natalia Abrams, president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center.",
      "At the same time, some borrowers are struggling to get their loan servicers on the phone, making it hard to find answers to their questions, said Abrams.",
      "If you're a student loan borrower, here are some answers to your questions.",
      "Applications for income-driven repayment plans are open, but they're taking longer than usual to process.",
      "The applications were temporarily shut down earlier this year after a federal court in Missouri blocked the SAVE plan, a Biden administration plan that offered a faster path to loan forgiveness. The judge's order also blocked parts of other repayment plans, prompting the Education Department to pause income-driven applications entirely.",
      "Amid pressure from advocates, the department reopened the applications on May 10.",
      "Borrowers can apply for the following income-driven plans: the Income-Based Repayment Plan, the Pay as You Earn plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment plan.",
      "Abrams expects applications will continue to be approved but at a slower pace than before the application pause.",
      "Borrowers currently enrolled in an income-driven plan should be receiving notifications about recertification, said Khandice Lofton, counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Recertification is required annually to update information on family size and income, and dates are different for each borrower.",
      "To review income-driven repayment plans, you can check the loan simulator at studentaid.gov.",
      "Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan have been placed in administrative forbearance while a legal challenge is resolved. That means they don't have to make payments and interest is not accruing. Time in forbearance normally does not count toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The Education Department will notify borrowers with updates on payments and litigation.",
      "\"We don't know for sure when the SAVE forbearance is going to end,\" Abrams said.",
      "While the future of the SAVE plan is decided in court, Abrams encourages borrowers to explore their eligibility for other income-driven repayment plans.",
      "The online application for loan consolidation is available again, at studentaid.gov/loan-consolidation. If you have multiple federal student loans, you can combine them into one with a fixed interest rate and a single monthly payment.",
      "The consolidation process typically takes around 60 days to complete. You can only consolidate your loans once.",
      "It would be difficult for the Education Department to reinstate loans that were canceled during President Joe Biden's administration. So far, it isn't believed to be happening, Abrams said.",
      "Nothing has changed yet.",
      "President Donald Trump wants to change the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to disqualify workers of nonprofit groups deemed to have engaged in \u201cimproper\u201d activities. He signed an executive order to that effect, but it has yet to be enforced.",
      "Borrowers enrolled in PSLF should keep up with payments to make progress toward loan forgiveness, said Sarah Austin, policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.",
      "\u201cThere could be some changes coming in regards to PSLF but at this current time PSLF is still functioning and there is still loan forgiveness being processed under the PSLF provision,\u201d said Austin.",
      "An income-driven repayment tracker has disappeared from the federal student loan website for many borrowers, said Abrams. For keeping track of their status, Abrams is recommending that borrowers take screenshots of their payments.",
      "Contacting your loan servicer is crucial to managing and understanding your student loans. Due to the large number of people trying to get answers or apply for programs, loan servicers are taking longer than usual to respond.",
      "Abrams recommends borrowers prepare for long wait times.",
      "\u201cWe've heard borrowers being in hold for three or four hours, then being transferred to a supervisor and then being hung up on, after all that wait time. It's incredibly frustrating,\u201d Abrams said.",
      "If you're delinquent, try to get back on track. Borrowers who don't make their payments for 270 days go into default, which has severe consequences.",
      "\u201cIf you're delinquent but have not defaulted yet, do whatever you can do to avoid going default,\u201d said Kate Wood, a student loans expert at NerdWallet.",
      "Borrowers who are delinquent on their student loans take a massive hit on their credit scores, which could drop 100 points or more, Wood said. A delinquency stays on your credit report for seven years.",
      "Wood recommends contacting your servicer to ask for options, which can include forbearance, deferment or applying for an income-driven repayment plan.",
      "The Education Department is recommending borrowers visit its Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation.",
      "Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute for Student Loan Advisors, recommends loan rehabilitation.",
      "Borrowers in default must ask their loan servicer to be placed into such a program. Typically, servicers ask for proof of income and expenses to calculate a payment amount. Once a borrower has paid on time for nine months in a row, they are taken out of default, Mayotte said. A loan rehabilitation can only be done once.",

      "Russia and Ukraine were holding their first direct peace talks in three years, in the Turkish port city of Istanbul, but officials and observers expected them to yield little immediate progress on stopping the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cUkraine is ready to take all realistic steps to end this war,\u201d Zelenskyy told leaders gathered for a summit of the European Political Community. But he warned: \u201cIf it turns out that the Russian delegation really is just theatrical and can\u2019t deliver any results today, the world must respond.\u201d",
      "That reaction, he said, should include \"sanctions against Russia\u2019s energy sector and banks.\u201d",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed his call, saying in a summit speech that \u201cRussia is dragging its feet and playing games.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must be prepared to follow through because if Russia won\u2019t come to the negotiating table, Putin must pay the price,\u201d he said, at the summit in the Albanian capital, Tirana.",
      "Zelenskyy's remarks came after Putin declined to attend face-to-face talks.",
      "\u201cI think Putin made a mistake by sending a low level delegation,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said as he arrived for the summit under a steady drizzle. \u201cThe ball is clearly in his part of the field now, in his court. He has to play ball. He has to be serious about wanting peace,\" Rutte added.",
      "European Union foreign chief Kaja Kallas said Putin was \u201cplaying games, which shows that they are not serious about peace.\u201d",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was clear that \u201cPresident Zelenskyy was ready to meet but President Putin never showed up, and this shows his true belief. So we will increase the pressure.\u201d",
      "Von der Leyen said the EU is preparing a new package of sanctions. She said that the measures will target the shadow fleet of aging cargo vessels that Russia is using to bypass international sanctions and the Nord Stream pipeline consortium.",
      "Russia\u2019s financial sector would also be targeted, she said. EU envoys have been working on the new sanctions package for several weeks, and the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers could enact them as soon as Tuesday.",
      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni stressed that efforts to reach a deal on Ukraine must continue.",
      "\u201cI think ... that we must not throw in the towel. I think we must insist, we must insist for an unconditional ceasefire and a serious peace agreement that includes guarantees of security for Ukraine,\u201d she said.",
      "The theme of the summit in Tirana is \u201cNew Europe in a new world: unity \u2014 cooperation \u2014 joint action.\u201d The gathering of leaders from about 50 nations and organizations was also scheduled to address ways to improve the continent\u2019s competitiveness and tackle unauthorized migration.",
      "But the summit best serves as a setting for leaders to meet bilaterally, or in small groups, to weigh in on major security issues. The inaugural summit in Prague in 2022 saw the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia holding rare talks in an effort to ease tensions between the longtime adversaries.",
      "The last summit, hosted by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, an ardent supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, was dominated by the concerns and opportunities that might arise in the wake of Trump's reelection.",
      "The leaders arrived in Tirana\u2019s central Skanderbeg Square on a rainy morning and were greeted by a brief performance by dancers in folk costumes before heading into the temporary conference hall, set up at the foot of a monument to Albania's national hero Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu, or Skanderbeg, who fought against the Ottoman Empire.",
      "The summit comes after the governing Socialist Party of the host, Prime Minister Edi Rama, won Albania\u2019s May 11 parliamentary election, attracting voters who support the country\u2019s long and somewhat uphill effort to join the European Union. The vote secured a fourth term for Rama.",
      "The prime minister said that the summit is a point of pride for Albania, and an \u201cinspiration and motivation to continue further on.\u201d",
      "His Socialist Party says it can deliver EU membership in five years.",
      "The EPC forum is Macron's brainchild, and was backed by former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, aiming to boost security and prosperity across the continent. But critics claimed it was an attempt by them to put the brakes on EU enlargement.",
      "The 2022 inaugural summit involved the EU's 27 member countries, aspiring partners in the Balkans and Eastern Europe, as well as neighbors like the U.K. \u2014 the only country to have left the EU \u2014 and Turkey.",
      "Russia is the one major European power not invited, along with Belarus, its neighbor and supporter in the war with Ukraine.",

      "A construction magnate and more than a dozen other people have surrendered to police on criminal negligence charges for the collapse of a Bangkok high-rise during a March 28 earthquake",
      "BANGKOK -- A construction magnate, builders, designers and engineers surrendered to police Friday on criminal negligence charges for the deadly collapse of a Bangkok high-rise in the March 28 earthquake that hit Myanmar.",
      "Premchai Karnasuta, the president of Italian-Thai Development Co, the main Thai contractor for the building project, as well as designers and engineers were among 17 charged with the felony of professional negligence causing death, Bangkok deputy police chief Noppasin Poonsawat said.",
      "Noppasin said those who met police on Friday formally denied the charges. Several have previously issued public denials in response to allegations in the media.",
      "Ninety-two people were confirmed dead in the rubble of the building that had been under construction and a small number of other people remain unaccounted for. The building, which was to become a new State Audit Office, was the only one in Thailand to collapse in the earthquake that was centered in neighboring Myanmar. The search for victims at the site has been halted, though efforts to identify remains through DNA will continue.",
      "Noppasin said at a news conference that evidence and testimony from experts suggested the building plan did not meet standards and codes. The Bangkok Post newspaper said police had also determined the project showed \"structural flaws in the core lift shaft and substandard concrete and steel.\u201d",
      "Thai media have reported allegations of wrongdoing in the project almost every day since the building\u2019s collapse, many of them involving irregular documentation for the project. Their reports have highlighted the role of Italian-Thai\u2019s Chinese joint venture partner, the China Railway No. 10 company, which is involved in projects around the world.",
      "One of the 17 charged Friday was Chinese executive Zhang Chuanling, a director at China Railway No. 10\u2019s joint venture with Italian-Thai Development. He was previously arrested last month on a charge of violating Thai business law by wrongly using Thai nominees to serve as the Chinese firm\u2019s proxies to allegedly control the joint venture. Three Thai executives were also arrested on the charge.",
      "A Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for the 17 on the negligence charge on Thursday. Noppasin said 15 turned themselves in at a police station in the morning and the remaining two were expected to do so later Friday.",
      "The epicenter of the quake was in central Myanmar, where it killed more than 3,700 people and caused major damage in Mandalay, the country's second biggest city, and the capital Naypyitaw.",
      "Premchai\u2019s case is his second major tangle with the law. In 2019, he was convicted of wildlife poaching and served about three years in prison.",
      "He was found guilty of killing protected animals and illegal possession of weapons after park rangers found a hunting party at a wildlife sanctuary in 2018 with carcasses of a rare black panther, a kalij pheasant and a barking deer. The panther had been butchered and its meat cooked for soup.",

      "Much like its creator, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok was preoccupied with South African racial politics on social media this week, posting unsolicited claims about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people.",
      "The chatbot, made by Musk's company xAI, kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in response to users of Musk's social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. Musk, who was born in South Africa, frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Musk and his companies haven\u2019t provided an explanation for Grok's responses, which were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment Thursday.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, but on Thursday the absence of any explanation forced those outside the company to make their best guesses.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Graham's post brought what appeared to be a sarcastic response from Musk's rival, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.",
      "\u201cThere are many ways this could have happened. I\u2019m sure xAI will provide a full and transparent explanation soon,\u201d wrote Altman, who has been sued by Musk in a dispute rooted in the founding of OpenAI.",
      "Some asked Grok itself to explain, but like other chatbots, it is prone to falsehoods known as hallucinations, making it hard to determine if it was making things up.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees Monday, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group as Trump suspends refugee programs and halts arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression and has now been decried by Musk and others as promoting the killing of whites. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck believes the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically very random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "Business travel to the U.S. fell 9% in April as companies and workers grappled with economic uncertainty and anger over the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and border policies.",
      "The National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures Thursday showing the number of airline and ship passengers who entered the country last month using business visas.",
      "The Middle East was the only region that saw higher business travel to the U.S., with arrivals up 9.4% compared to April 2024. But that didn't make up for big losses from other regions; the number of business travelers from Western Europe fell 17.7%, for example.",
      "The new government data didn't include people coming from Canada for business or who traveled by land from Mexico. Mexican arrivals by air for those holding business visas were down 11.8%, the government said.",
      "And overall travel from Canada also fell in April. According to Statistics Canada, Canadian residents' return trips by air from the U.S. fell 20% in April, while return trips by car were down 35%.",
      "Business travel to the U.S. held up better than leisure travel in the first quarter of the year. According to U.S. government data, more than 1.2 million travelers entered the U.S. using business visas in the January-March period, up 7% from the year before. The number of travelers using tourist visas fell 6%.",
      "But that flipped in April, as the late Easter holiday likely encouraged more leisure travel. Travel to the U.S. by international travelers holding tourist visas was up 13.8% in April.",
      "It's unclear if that trend will hold. Cirium, an aviation analytics company, said an analysis of online travel agency data indicated that advance bookings from Europe to 14 U.S. cities in June, July and August were down 12% from those same months last year.",
      "Multiple U.S. airlines have pulled their financial forecasts for the year, citing uncertainty and weaker demand from lower-fare leisure travelers. Many industry experts think business travel to the U.S. will continue to decline in the coming months.",
      "Leslie Andrews, the global travel leader for real estate company JLL and a board member at the Global Business Travel Association Foundation, said she thinks corporate travel to the U.S. will slow in the second and third quarters of the year as the full impact of economic and geopolitical volatility sets in.",
      "\u201cWhat I am hearing is, \u2018Things were good in the first quarter,\u2019 but in the second quarter it\u2019s a matter of, \u2018Must you take that trip?\u2019\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThey\u2019re pulling in the reins a bit to make sure only purposeful travel is happening as things grow and evolve.\u201d",
      "BT4Europe, a business travel association, said companies are increasingly wary about unpredictable procedures to enter the U.S. and the risk of detention, especially for LGBTQ+ individuals or those who have voiced political opinions on social media.",
      "Kevin Haggarty usually travels to the United States from Canada several times a year to attend trade shows in Atlanta or Las Vegas or to visit suppliers in Los Angeles. But his concerns about crossing the border will keep him from making those trips this year.",
      "Haggarty, who owns a company that sells gifts and souvenirs, said Canadian retailers no longer want U.S.-made merchandise. His U.S. suppliers are struggling to stay afloat due to U.S. tariffs on products made in China. Above all, he\u2019s concerned about reports of international travelers being detained at the U.S. border.",
      "\u201cHonestly, my nervousness and reluctance to cross into the U.S. stems from that more than any hostility to the American market,\u201d said Haggarty, who lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Global Business Travel Association CEO Suzanne Neufang said a poll of more than 900 of the association\u2019s members last month showed nearly one-third expected a decline in global travel volumes this year.",
      "Canadian members were the most pessimistic, with 71% saying they expect a decrease in travel this year, Neufang said.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty is unnerving for a business travel sector that likes to be safe and likes to be efficient,\u201d she said.",
      "A drop-off in business trips would represent a setback for the U.S. travel industry and cities that host international conventions and trade shows. The $1.6 trillion global business travel sector was finally returning to normal after the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. business travel spending reached pre-COVID levels in 2023, Neufang said, while the rest of the world achieved that last year.",
      "Brett Sterenson, the president of Hotel Lobbyists, a Washington firm that helps groups book hotels for meetings and conferences, said he was losing international business as some countries warn travelers not to visit the U.S.",
      "U.S. government cuts are also hurting business, Sterenson said. He works with several groups that offer international exchange programs through the State Department. The programs welcome travelers from Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and elsewhere and share best practices on things like energy policy and environmental stewardship, he said. But with funding cuts, that part of his business is down 75%.",
      "\u201cThese exchanges were monumentally useful in spreading goodwill, but also in educating developing nations on good governance,\u201d Sterenson said.",
      "Haggarty, in Canada, said he canceled a trip to a trade show in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and said several retailers he works with also pulled out. He\u2019s now looking to England, France, Spain and other markets for goods to sell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. It\u2019s much easier to bring products to Canada from the U.S., but we\u2019re in a corner,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to know just how much damage this administration is doing to their relationships globally.\u201d",

      "Services prices fell 0.7%, the biggest drop in government records going back to 2009, on shrinking profit margins at wholesalers and retailers. Wholesale food prices fell 1%, and egg prices plunged 39%, though they are still up nearly 45% from a year ago because of bird flu.",

      "\u201cIt'd be electric,\" he said following the Mets' 3-2 win Saturday. \u201cAny chance we can avoid the Van Wyck, that\u2019d be great.\u201d",
      "Alonso would love the chance to play an environmentally friendly World Series entirely in New York and avoid the perpetually congested expressway leading to John F. Kennedy International Airport.",
      "Subway Series spark memories of Don Larsen's perfect game, clutch catches by Al Gionfriddo and Sandy Amoros, and David Cone coming out of the bullpen to retire Mike Piazza. With the Mets and Yankees leading their divisions a quarter of the way through the regular season, there's a chance of the first Subway Series since 2000 but a long way to go.",
      "Even for a regular-season meeting on a Saturday afternoon, the sellout crowd of 47,510 at Yankee Stadium was amped up \u2014 especially when booing Soto, who helped the Yankees reach the World Series last year and then bolted across town for a record $765 million, 15-year contract with the Mets.",
      "\u201cTypically I do a pretty good job of blocking the noise out,\u201d Yankees pitcher Clarke Schmidt said. \u201cThere was a time where he was up I had to turn up the PitchCom because it was tough to hear.\u201d",
      "Winners of a record 27 titles but none since 2009, the Yankees lead the AL East at 26-19. The Mets, boosted by hedge fund owner Steve Cohen's fortune, top the NL East at 29-17 as they seek their third championship and first since 1986.",
      "Last year, the Mets lost in the National League Championship Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers, who beat the Yankees in the World Series. While there were 13 Subway Series from 1921-56 \u2014 six between the Yankees and Brooklyn Dodgers and seven between Yankees and New York Giants \u2014 there has been only one since.",
      "\u201cIt'd be sick,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cThat\u2019d be probably the best postseason matchup ever because you don\u2019t have to go on the road. You have seven home games. ... You don\u2019t have to worry about dealing with all the great wall of traffic out of JFK.\u201d",
      "A day after the Yankees won the opener of six regular-season meetings 6-2, Francisco Lindor's ninth-inning sacrifice fly off Fernando Cruz broke a 2-all tie and Edwin D\u00edaz ended the game by getting Aaron Judge to swing over a 98.6 mph full-count fastball. A runner on each team was thrown at the plate, and an umpire interference call on himself by James Jean negated a Yankees double steal.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you call a big league game, big league matchup. Every pitch was intense, every play,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \u201cThat's what you pay for, to come and watch a big league game when you got two teams with a lot of superstars.\u201d",
      "Soto went 1 for 4 with a walk and is 1 for 6 with four walks in his first two games back in the Bronx, booed noisily each time he walked to the plate or touched the ball defensively. He threw some shade two pitches into his first at-bat Saturday \u2014 he tossed his mirrored sunglasses on a perfect spring afternoon, deciding he'd see better without them.",
      "Soto tipped his helmet to the crowd before his first plate appearance Friday and provided another moment of levity in the fifth inning Saturday when he shook a \u201cno\u201d to Schmidt after the pitcher started to the dugout following a 2-2 knuckle-curve at the low, outside corner. Jean called ball three, and Soto wound up walking.",
      "\u201cI thought out of the hand it was a ball and it was a ball,\u201d Schmidt said.",
      "Consistent throughout the season, the Mets are the only team that hasn't had a three-game losing streak. And while players and staff are focused on the next game, fans have the luxury to dream ahead to a 15th Subway Series.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, \u201cit would be pretty cool.\u201d",

      "Journalism has won the 150th running of the Preakness Stakes",
      "BALTIMORE -- Journalism jostled with horses down the stretch, shrugged off the contact, burst through the lane and came from behind to win the 150th running of the Preakness Stakes on Saturday.",
      "The odds-on favorite was bumped by Goal Oriented near the quarter pole, and it looked like another second-place finish was coming two weeks after being the runner-up to Sovereignty in the Kentucky Derby. Journalism instead ran right by Gosger to give trainer Michael McCarthy his second win in a Triple Crown race.",
      "\u201cA lot of bouncing around there,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWhen I saw that, I kind of resigned myself to the fact it was another fantastic effort and maybe come up a little bit short. But it just goes to show the testament that this horse has. Couldn\u2019t be prouder of him.\u201d",
      "Gosger was second by a half-length. Sandman was third and Bob Baffert-trained Goal Oriented fourth. Journalism went 1 3/16 miles in 1:55.37.",
      "Umberto Rispoli became the first jockey from Italy to win any of the Triple Crown races.",
      "\u201cWhen I crossed the wire, the first things that comes up to my mind, it\u2019s all of the 20 years of my career that pass in front of me,\u201d Rispoli said. \u201cI had to wait so long to be on a champion like that.\u201d",
      "Journalism handled the adversity and thrived on a warm day that dried out the track after torrential rain fell at Pimlico Race Course for much of the past week. Those conditions suited him better than the slop at Churchill Downs in the Derby",
      "\u201cThis victory symbolizes so much about life,\" co-owner Aaron Wellman said. \u201cIt took guts for Umberto Rispoli to power his way through a seemingly impossible hole getting side-swiped and threading the needle and powering on through. And it took guts from an incredible horse to somehow will his way to victory.\u201d",
      "Journalism paid $4 to win, $2.80 to place and $2.40 to show.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a remarkable horse,\u201d Baffert said of Journalism. \u201cI wanted to be on the lead and was behind horses. I knew (Goal Oriented) was intimidated. He\u2019s never run that way. He ran well, but he\u2019s still too green for that.\u201d",
      "Sovereignty did not take part after his owners and trainer Bill Mott decided to skip the Preakness, citing the two-week turnaround, and aimed for the Belmont on June 7. That made this a fifth time in seven years that the Preakness, for various reasons, was contested without a Triple Crown bid at stake.",
      "But Journalism staked his claim for 3-year-old horse of the year by winning the $2 million American classic race run at the old Pimlico Race Course for the last time before it\u2019s torn down and rebuilt. While work went on around him before the postrace news conference, Wellman asked, \u201cAre they already tearing this place down?\u201d",
      "Not yet, and not before Journalism could add a memorable chapter by squeezing through the space he had to win.",
      "\u201cI still can\u2019t realize what this horse did,\u201d Rispoli said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about him. It\u2019s a pleasure and privilege to ride a horse like him.\u201d",
      "The Preakness is set to be held at nearby Laurel Park, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., next year before a planned return to the new Pimlico in 2027. McCarthy raved about the history at the place known as \u201cOld Hilltop\u201d and still remembers where he was when Sunday Silence beat Easy Goer at the wire in 1989 in a fashion similar to how Journalism won this time.",
      "\u201cThings kind of come full circle,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI\u2019m sad to see this place go, but we\u2019ll try to get back here next year, whichever locale it\u2019s at.\u201d",
      "Journalism is the first horse to win the Preakness after running in the Kentucky Derby since Mark Casse-trained War of Will in 2019. He is the first Derby runner-up to follow that up by winning the Preakness since Exaggerator in 2016.",
      "Only two others from the 19 in the Derby participated in the Preakness: Casse\u2019s Sandman and fellow Hall of Famer D. Wayne Lukas\u2019 American Promise, who did not have the same positive response as Journalism.",
      "\u201cThe best horse won,\u201d Lukas said. \u201cHe finished beautifully.\"",
      "Lukas, the 89-year-old who has saddled the most horses in Preakness history, referred to McCarthy once this week as \u201cthe new guy.\u201d This was just McCarthy\u2019s second, and he\u2019s 2 for 2 after Rombauer sprung the upset as an 11-1 long shot in 2021.",
      "This one was more emotional, with McCarthy and his wife still displaced from their home by the Southern California wildfires.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll get back there,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cEverybody will get back there. We\u2019ll rebuild. This is for Altadena.\u201d",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Rory McIlroy was part of roughly 50 players whose drivers were tested before the PGA Championship, which was described Saturday as a normal procedure designed to protect players who are not aware if their clubs have exceeded limits.",
      "McIlroy drew particular attention when Sirius XM PGA Tour Radio reported Friday afternoon that his driver was deemed nonconforming and the Masters champion could no longer use it at Quail Hollow.",
      "McIlroy has not spoken to the media the last two days.",
      "Kerry Haigh, chief championships officer for the PGA of America, confirmed the USGA was asked to test drivers at the PGA Championship. The USGA, which governs golf in the U.S. and Mexico, regularly conducts tests on the PGA Tour when asked.",
      "Results are confidential.",
      "Haigh said the standard process is for one-third of the 156-man field to have driver tests and that was the case at Quail Hollow.",
      "\u201cFinding driver heads that have crept over the line of conformance is not an unusual occurrence, especially for clubs that are hit thousands of times over a long period of time,\u201d Haigh said in a statement. \u201cThe results are kept confidential to protect players, who are unaware the club has fallen out of conformance and not responsible for it falling out of conformance other than hitting the club thousands of times.\u201d",
      "Drivers that exceed USGA limits, particularly when the face gets too thin and can cause a slight trampoline effect, need to be replaced. Haigh said players change \u201cwithout issue.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo publicly identify players whose club did not conform can lead to that player being questioned unnecessarily,\u201d Haigh said, referring to why results are confidential. \"Neither the USGA nor the PGA of America have any concerns about player intent.\u201d",
      "Some companies tend to make the face as thin as possible, within limits, for greater distance. When constantly hit at swing speeds around 115 mph, topping 120 mph for the power players, that can allow a club to become nonconforming, known as \u201ccreep.\"",

      "The Caitlin Clark-Angel Reese rivalry has added another chapter",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese agreed on one thing Saturday: Their minor dustup during the season opener was just the result of a basketball play.",
      "Aside from that, Clark did most of the talking.",
      "She downplayed the on-court fracas that occurred with 4:38 left in the third quarter, which spurred Indiana to a 93-58 victory over the Chicago Sky. It started with Reese grabbing an offensive rebound and Clark slapping Reese's arm hard enough to jar the ball loose and knock Reese to floor.",
      "When Reese got up, she tried to confront Clark before Indiana center Aliyah Boston stepped in between the two players. Clark's third personal foul was upgraded to a flagrant 1 while Boston and Reese each drew technical fouls following a replay review by the referees.",
      "\u201cLet's not make it something that it's not,\u201d Clark said after posting the third triple-double of her career. \u201cIt was just a good play on the basketball. I'm not sure what the ref saw to upgrade it, and that's up to their discretion. It's a take foul to put them at the free-throw line. I've watched a lot of basketball in my life, that's exactly what it was. I wasn't trying to do anything malicious. That's not the type of player I am.\u201d",
      "Still, it's hard to ignore the obvious \u2014 that the fray added another chapter to the rivalry that has captivated women's basketball. It dates to their college days, when Reese helped lead LSU to a 102-85 victory over Clark's Iowa Hawkeyes for the 2022-23 national championship. Clark won the rematch in the spring of 2024, a game that drew 12.3 million television viewers.",
      "Less than eight weeks later, they were squaring off in the WNBA in the first of four matchups. The Fever took three of those contests, many featuring hard fouls. In the end Clark helped Indiana make the playoffs and the Sky came up short as Reese missed the final two weeks of games with a season-ending wrist injury.",
      "Now this.",
      "Reese's analysis of what happened?",
      "\u201cA basketball play,\u201d she said without elaborating after scoring 12 points and grabbing 17 rebounds.",
      "When a follow-up question was asked later in the interview, a team spokesman cut her off, saying Reese had already answered the question. And when new coach Tyler Marsh was asked about his thoughts, he paused before repeating Reese's answer.",
      "Indiana had a little more to say after Clark finished with 20 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and a career-high four blocks.",
      "\u201cNobody's going to get anything easy against us,\u201d new Fever coach Stephanie White said. \u201cWe're going to be a tough defensive team. I thought it was a clear play on the ball as well. One of the points of emphasis is we can't give up. But I thought it was a clear play on the ball.\u201d",
      "Crew chief Roy Gulbeyan disagreed.",
      "\u201cThe foul on Clark met the criteria for flagrant foul 1, for wind up, impact, and follow through for the extension of the left hand to Reese\u2019s back, which is deemed not a legitimate basketball play, and therefore deemed unnecessary contact,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the foul, there is a physical taunt technical on Boston and a verbal technical on Reese, which offset.\u201d",
      "Boston may have been the most surprised, not even realizing she had been called for the technical until after the game. She reacted by putting her hands on her face, looking surprised and asking if she really had drawn the technical.",

      "After Reese missed the first of two throws, Gainbridge Fieldhouse erupted in cheers. Reese made the second and Chicago added a layup on the ensuing possession to close to 56-45.",
      "Then the Fever closed the third quarter with nine straight points to extend the margin by 20 and never let Chicago get closer than 18 the rest of the way as they matched the second-largest victory margin in franchise history.",
      "\u201cI went for the ball, clear as day in the replay,\u201d Clark said. \u201cYou watch it, you know it shouldn't have been upgraded. Again that's up to the refs' discretion, but I appreciate A.B. having my back.\u201d",

But he\u2019s only averaging 16.5 points and shooting 33.7% from the field in the series, way down from his regular-season numbers. Denver\u2019s Jamal Murray hasn\u2019t shot his best in the series either, but he overcame an illness to score 25 points and be a critical factor in Denver\u2019s Game 6 win. He\u2019s up and down, but if the good version of him shows up, Oklahoma City could be in trouble.",

      "Goaltender Frederik Andersen has been strong through two rounds of the playoffs for the Carolina Hurricanes",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Frederik Andersen has stayed as calmly consistent as it gets in the NHL playoffs. That's helped the Carolina Hurricanes make it back to the Eastern Conference final for the second time in three seasons.",
      "The 35-year-old veteran has the best save percentage and goals-against average in the postseason among goalies with multiple starts, notably by holding opponents to one or zero goals in six of his nine starts. He's coming off giving up six goals in five second-round games against the Washington Capitals, who posted the conference's best regular-season record and was second behind Winnipeg for the Presidents' Trophy.",
      "\u201cHe's just doing what we knew he could always do,\u201d defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere said Saturday as the Hurricanes await the end of the Florida-Toronto series to learn their next opponent. \u201cHe's been the backbone of our team for sure, all playoffs. And we've relied on him heavily in the sense he's making that big save for us that allows us to win these games.\u201d",
      "Andersen has posted elite numbers so far.",
      "He's 7-2 with a 1.36 goals-against average and a .937 save percentage. No other starting goaltender has a sub-2.00 GAA in the playoffs entering the weekend. And he's been a perfect backstop for a defense that has smothered its first two foes.",
      "\u201cI just try to be as good as possible in every situation, and be in the moment in whatever comes in front of me and in whatever situation in the game,\u201d Andersen said before the Hurricanes' Game 5 closeout of the Caps. \"I don't get to decide how much we have the puck, how much they have the puck and how many times they shoot it.",
      "\u201cI've just got to put myself in the best position to make saves in whatever situation comes.\u201d",
      "Two things have stood out in Andersen's postseason through two rounds. One is how firmly he's grabbed the role of no-doubt, every-game starter in this postseason.",
      "\u201cHe gave us the \u2018I want the net,\u2019 and that's all you need to hear,\u201d coach Rod Brind'Amour said before Game 4 of the first-round series against New Jersey.",
      "The other has been his durability so far after health and injury issues of recent year. The only hiccup in these playoffs was an early exit in Game 4 against the Devils due to a hit by a skating-in Timo Meier that sidelined him for the Game 5 clincher, though a long break between rounds had him back in the crease for Game 1 against Washington.",
      "He's had strong postseason stretches before, notably when the Hurricanes last reached the Eastern final in 2023 and his 1.83 GAA was second among goalies with multiple postseason starts. But the health issues had been more frequent, from him missing the 2022 playoffs due to a lower-body injury late in the regular season to appearing in just 16 regular-season games last season due to a blood-clotting issue.",
      "This year, he missed November, December and most of January due to knee surgery then returned as part of a rotation with 25-year-old Pyotr Kochetkov.",
      "\u201cI just kind of enjoy being out here,\" Andersen said. \"I think that's one of the bigger things for me. You guys obviously know my history the last couple of years with some things that no one wants to have happen to you. You go through it and it's a good reminder of how precious this time you get to play the sport is.\u201d",
      "Andersen's play has been an integral part of Carolina's elite defensive efforts through two rounds, fitting perfectly in with the Hurricanes' efforts to smother opponents with an aggressive forecheck, control the puck in the offensive zone to pressure defenders \u2014 and thereby minimize some of the chances Andersen has to stop.",
      "To that point, Andersen has faced as many as 30 shots on goal only once in the postseason. The Capitals never managed more than 21 shots in any game, and had seven or fewer shots in 11 of 15 regulation periods. And he recently signed a one-year contract extension to return next season alongside Kochetkov.",
      "In the meantime, keeping Andersen fresh and healthy is a priority. After all, the Hurricanes are merely at the halfway point in their pursuit to win a second Stanley Cup, the other coming in 2006 with Brind'Amour as captain.",
      "\u201cWhen Freddie is in net, he\u2019s a stud and he\u2019s been a stud his whole career,\u201d Carolina captain Jordan Staal said after Thursday's win in Washington. \u201cYou guys always talk about his calmness and he\u2019s a rock, just makes things look easy.\u201d",

      "The fate of the NASCAR All-Star Race largely rests on the whims of Marcus Smith, who is giving few hints about how he\u2019ll deploy a new \u201cPromoter\u2019s Caution.\u201d",
      "The fate of the NASCAR All-Star Race largely rests on the whims of Marcus Smith, who is giving few hints about how he\u2019ll deploy a new \u201cPromoter\u2019s Caution.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest goofy gimmick in an event defined by annual format changes designed to goose the competition in the name of fender-banging fireworks. At a randomly selected point Sunday night during the first 220 of 250 laps at North Wilkesboro Speedway, a yellow flag will fly and possibly wipe out a big lead while bunching the field for a race-altering restart.",
      "The decision on when to throw the yellow rests solely with Smith, the president and CEO of Speedway Motorsports, which owns the 0.625-mile track in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll have a very special mystery guest with a little All-Star Race history of his own to help me out when it\u2019s time to drop the yellow,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll create a little chaos for the teams and some fun for the fans at the same time.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an attempt to restore some luster to the All-Star Race, which has lost touch with its no-holds-barred origins. The past two events at North Wilkesboro produced runaway victories for Kyle Larson and Joey Logano, who led 199 of 200 laps in 2024.",
      "The most memorable event last year came after the race when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Kyle Busch engaged in fisticuffs after tangling for a mid-pack position. It was a far cry from the furious last-lap battles that once sent an All-Star Race winner to the emergency room (Davey Allison sustained a concussion in 1992 after crashing from contact with Kyle Petty at the checkered flag).",
      "The Promoter\u2019s Caution won\u2019t guarantee a slam-bang ending, but it\u2019s in the vein of an exhibition race with $1 million but no points at stake. While other pro sports have struggled to keep all-star events relevant, Cup Series drivers pride themselves on competing as hard as they would in a race with championship implications \u2014 and sometimes harder.",
      "\u201cThe All Star Race is not just another race,\u201d Joe Gibbs Racing\u2019s Christopher Bell said. \u201cEverybody is more aggressive than a normal Sunday Cup race. Everyone has that win it or wear it attitude, and it races differently because of that.\u201d",
      "A sense of resignation from the All-Star Race\u2019s annual format overhauls also makes it easier to accept the inanity of a random yellow.",
      "\u201cI have a hard enough time keeping up with all of the different format stuff,\u201d Team Penske\u2019s Austin Cindric said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really bother me that much that we\u2019re going to have a Promoter\u2019s Caution because, unless I\u2019m the caution, I can\u2019t control it in any way. It\u2019s just the racing gods, but maybe they\u2019re on earth this time.\u201d",
      "Though its timing could cost him a win, Logano is fine with the Promoter\u2019s Caution because \u201cthe All-Star Race presents the opportunity to try things outside of the box.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we should have a Promoter\u2019s Caution in points-paying events,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in this case, we do something different. It\u2019s something everyone can talk about. And I just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do. Are they going to put Marcus in the flag stand, and he\u2019s just going to throw a yellow flag?\u201d",
      "The son of late NASCAR Hall of Famer Bruton Smith, who once lobbied for random yellows as the most bombastic promoter in Cup history, is coy about how the Promoter\u2019s Caution will be unveiled.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had no shortage of NASCAR experts from inside and outside of the garage giving me advice on what to do,\u201d Marcus Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of scenarios in mind depending on what\u2019s happening with the race. Or I could just go spur of the moment with my gut.\u201d",
      "Christopher Bell (+350) is the BetMGM Sportsbook favorite, followed by pole-sitter Brad Keselowski (+600), Logano (+650), two-time defending Daytona 500 winner William Byron (+700) and Denny Hamlin (+800). Kyle Larson, who will start last after missing practice and qualifying while attempting to make the Indy 500, is listed at +1000. ... Keselowski and Bell were the winners Saturday of the two 75-lap heat races that set the starting lineup for the All-Star Race. Keselowski already was guaranteed the top starting spot for Sunday night's main event after qualifying on the pole position Friday. Bell will start second Sunday, followed by Ross Chastain, Logano and Byron. \u2026 After sitting essentially dormant for more than 35 years, North Wilkesboro Speedway is playing host to its third consecutive All-Star Race since a $20 million makeover. Keselowski wants to move a points race from Charlotte Motor Speedway\u2019s \u201cRoval\u201d layout to North Wilkesboro Speedway and shift the All-Star Race back to Charlotte\u2019s 1.5-mile oval (the host from 1987-2019). \u201cThis needs to be a points racetrack,\u201d Keselowski said of North Wilkesboro. \u201cI\u2019m very strong about the Roval has got to go.\u201d",

      "It was three familiar faces at the top of the Indianapolis 500 qualifying board after the first round of time trials",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Three familiar faces were at the top of the Indianapolis 500 qualifying board after the first round of time trials, with two-time defending IndyCar series champion Alex Palou holding the provisional pole.",
      "Palou, winner of four of the first five races this season, qualified at 233.043 mph in a Honda-powered entry Saturday to top the Team Penske drivers of Scott McLaughlin and two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden.",
      "\u201cIt was an amazing day for us,\u201d Palou said. \u201cIn practice we were not able to finish a full qualifying run. It was tough conditions. But we had a ton of speed in the car.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin went 233.013 and Newgarden was third at 233.004 in Chevrolets. A year ago, all three Penske cars swept the front row at the Indianapolis 500 and Newgarden used a last-lap pass to put himself in position to become the first driver to win \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing\u201d three consecutive years in next Sunday\u2019s race.",
      "That trio took the rest of the day off after their initial qualifying runs. It was a far more stressful session for some other top stars, including Marco Andretti, who failed to lock himself into the field of 33 on the first day of qualifying.",
      "Andretti will now have to prepare for a Sunday shootout against Marcus Armstrong, who crashed in morning practice but got a backup on track as the minutes ticked down on Saturday's session, Rinus VeeKay and rookie Jacob Abel.",
      "One of the four will not make the field for \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing\u201d on May 25.",
      "\u201cWe just need to do four solid ones (laps Sunday) and we should be OK,\u201d Andretti said. \u201cBut just even running tomorrow is a bummer. We have speed problems. I've seen it across the garage with big teams. It's just how it is. I drew that straw this year.\"",
      "The famed Andretti family has only won the Indianapolis 500 once \u2014 a 1969 win by Mario Andretti \u2014 and the struggles his sons, nephew and grandson have gone through at the speedway are referred to as \u201cThe Andretti Curse.\u201d",
      "Armstrong said in addition to the car preparation Meyer Shank Racing had to do, the New Zealand native also had to go through IndyCar's concussion protocol to even be cleared to race.",
      "Their struggles ultimately benefited Graham Rahal, who was bumped from the field in 2023, but battled all day to finally grab the 30th and final guaranteed spot in Saturday's session. He had to sit inside his car and wait as Andretti and VeeKay made desperate final runs that could have knocked Rahal out of the field.",
      "Instead, they fell short and Rahal breathed a huge sigh of relief.",
      "\u201cTwo of the guys that ran there at the end, Marco and VeeKay, are two of the guys I respect the most around here. Both guys have been extremely fast, extremely talented at this place, and so you just never know,\u201d Rahal said. \u201cI think we improved our car. This day did not start out well. But we found a lot and I man, that beer is going to taste good tonight.\u201d",
      "The Saturday qualifying session decided the fast 12 that will run again Sunday to set the first four rows and crown the pole-winner. Drivers that qualified in spots 13 through 30 locked in their positions, but the slowest four cars go into a last-chance shootout Sunday to determine the final three spots. One driver will not make the field.",
      "The 12 drivers who will try for the pole Sunday are Palou, McLaughlin, Newgarden, Pato O'Ward, Scott Dixon, rookie Robert Shwartzman, David Malukas, Felix Rosenqvist, Takuma Sato, Will Power, Marcus Ericsson and Christian Lundgaard.",
      "The fast 12 fight for the pole comprises of seven former Indy 500 winners and a split of seven Chevrolet drivers and five Hondas.",
      "Track conditions were the worst of the week with heavy wind gusts that affected handling on the cars and played into two frightening crashes: Armstrong's morning wreck and an even more horrific crash for Colton Herta, who crashed in nearly the same spot as Armstrong in a much during his qualifying attempt.",
      "Herta's car actually flipped on its side and he was stuck riding the wall, cockpit side facing the concrete. His team desperately tried to reach him on the radio to check on him but the car was so mangled, Herta could not reach the button to answer Andretti Global.",
      "He got back onto the track in a totally rebuilt car.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that transferred over was the engine, everything else was destroyed,\u201d said Herta, who qualified 29th. \u201cThis place doesn't scare me. I don't have a problem hitting the wall here and having big ones like today. It doesn't feel good, it sucks, but it doesn't scare me when I get back in the car.\u201d",
      "Kyle Larson, who is attempting to run both the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day, locked into the Indy field but will start 21st at Indy. He planned to stay overnight in Indianapolis and travel to North Wilkesboro Speedway in North Carolina on Sunday for NASCAR's All-Star race.",

      "New York built a 14-point halftime lead before Las Vegas chipped away to get within 66-64 early in the fourth quarter. Cloud, who came to the Liberty in an offseason trade, then had consecutive three-point plays to start an 8-0 run that made it 74-64 with 5:47 left.",
      "Las Vegas could only get within six the rest of the way.",
      "A'ja Wilson led Las Vegas with 31 points and 16 rebounds. Jackie Young added 16 points for the Aces, who were missing reserve Crystal Bradford. Bradford was serving a one-game suspension for an incident from 2021. This was her first time on a regular-season roster since then.",
      "Jewell Loyd, who came to the Aces in the offseason via a trade, struggled in her first game with Las Vegas. She missed her first four shots before scoring her first points on an elbow jumper midway through the second quarter. She finished with five points.",

      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Alex Ovechkin said Saturday he intends to return to the Washington Capitals for his 21st NHL season after breaking Wayne Gretzky's career goal-scoring record earlier this spring.",
      "Ovechkin joked about joining the minor league Hershey Bears for their playoff run and indicated the question wasn't whether he'd be back but rather if he had what it takes to earn a spot.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, (I have) to make a roster at 40 years old,\u201d Ovechkin quipped on locker cleanout day, less than 48 hours after he and the Capitals were eliminated in the second round by Carolina.",
      "Ovechkin, who turns 40 in September, has one season left on his five-year, $47.5 million contract he signed in 2021. He said he is approaching the summer like any other, planning to train the same way in the offseason and see where things go.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to use those couple months (in the offseason) to rest, enjoy my life, then back to work,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cMe and (trainer Pavel Burlachenko are) going do our job to get ready for the season and just do my best.\"",
      "Ovechkin is coming off a whirlwind of a season, where he overcame a broken leg to score 44 goals \u2014 the third most in the league \u2014 and pass Gretzky's mark of 894 that long seemed unapproachable. The Russian superstar has 897.",
      "\u201cFor him to come back this year and play the way that he did, chase down this record, the start that he had, breaking his leg, coming back from that, and just continuing to not only do things he did individually, statistically, but lead our team \u2014 that\u2019s part of the story that will be a minor part of it, but it\u2019s a big part of it,\" coach Spencer Carbery said after the Game 5 loss to the Hurricanes on Thursday night.",
      "\"He did what he came back this year to prove and show, and he did it in the playoffs as well. I tip my cap to \u2018O\u2019 and the season that he had and as our captain leading the way.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin led the team with five goals in 10 games this postseason, but had just one goal in the second round as he and the team fell short of the Eastern Conference final for the 15th time in 16 appearances during his career. The other time was their Stanley Cup run in 2018, when Ovechkin won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP.",
      "Going into next season, Ovechkin wants to work toward chasing a second championship.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking forward for next year,\" Ovechkin said. \"I\u2019m going to try to do my best to play and my team is going to help me, too. ... I just want to come back next year and see the team who\u2019s capable of winning the Stanley Cup.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s not really about the books.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has instead morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers, as the White House tries to wrest control of what has for centuries been a legislative institution.",
      "It\u2019s a power struggle with potentially vast consequences. The Library of Congress not only stores the world's largest collection of books but also an office overseeing reams of copyrighted material of untold value.",
      "There is a research institute that has long been protected from outside influence. Its servers house extremely sensitive information regarding claims of workplace violations on Capitol Hill, as well as payments and other financial data for the legislative branch\u2019s more than 30,000 employees. There\u2019s even speculation that the whole affair is tied to an ongoing debate over whether big tech companies can use copyrighted material for artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Because of this, the battle over control of the Library of Congress has prompted Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver rare pushback against a president who has pressed to expand the boundaries of his own power to enact his priorities. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans have been talking with the White House about a potential path to d\u00e9tente.",
      "This all has left the library in a bizarre state of purgatory.",
      "For now, Trump's choices for interim library leaders \u2014 most notably Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general who had represented the president in his criminal proceedings \u2014 have not appeared to challenge the assertion by the library that one of its veteran officials would be the acting head. It would be unheard of for an executive branch official such as Blanche to simultaneously serve in the legislative branch, according to experts.",
      "\u201cThis egregious overreach into the legislature by the executive branch is just unwarranted and, we believe, unprecedented,\u201d said New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which oversees the Library of Congress.",
      "The controversy began to unfold publicly last week, when Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden was fired in a terse email from a White House official. She had just one year left in her 10-year term.",
      "Then this week, Blanche was tapped by the White House to be the interim librarian, and two other Justice Department officials were chosen for other senior library posts. Those officials, Brian Nieves and Paul Perkins, tried unsuccessfully to enter the U.S. Copyright Office on Monday, but left voluntarily after library officials called Capitol Police.",
      "Thune told The Associated Press that Congress was \u201cnot entirely\u201d consulted ahead of Trump\u2019s dismissal of Hayden.",
      "Lawmakers want to ensure that \u201ccongressional legislative branch equities are protected,\u201d Thune said. He speculated that discussions with the White House to resolve the standoff would bleed into next week.",
      "The White House has said Trump was within his authority to dismiss Hayden, a former head of the library systems in Baltimore. It cited \u201cquite concerning\u201d behavior from Hayden involving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as well as books for children that the White House found inappropriate.",
      "A copy of virtually every book published in the U.S. is sent to the Copyright Office, then the library decides whether to include it in the main collection. No one under 16 can get a reader card to access the collection.",
      "Existing regulations and past practices call for an acting librarian to come from the Library of Congress\u2019 current ranks if there is a vacancy. But the White House has argued that a law governing federal vacancies applies, even though the 1998 law deals with the executive branch, according to two people familiar with the discussions.",
      "When Nieves and Perkins showed up on Monday, they held a letter that invoked the vacancies law to justify their appointments, according to one of the people.",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who leads the panel overseeing funding for the Library of Congress, argued that in practice, the librarian is not a legislative branch employee, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an appointment by the president of the United States, because we have to confirm her.\u201d",
      "Yet there is deep concern among lawmakers and aides about any unjustified intrusion of the administration into the Library of Congress and its operations.",
      "Especially worrisome to them is potential meddling with the Congressional Research Service, known as the nonpartisan think tank of Capitol Hill. It fields roughly 75,000 requests from members of Congress every year for research, legal expertise and other information critical for policymaking.",
      "The discussions between lawmakers and the Congressional Research Service are considered so sensitive that they are protected under the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which shields members of Congress from being questioned -\u2013 such as in court -\u2013 about official legislative acts.",
      "The service's \u201cutility and trustworthiness would be substantially undercut if these inquiries were not protected or the Administration sought to shape responses to reflect its priorities,\u201d said Hope O\u2019Keeffe, a former associate general counsel at the Library of Congress.",
      "The library also oversees the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which functions as the human resources office of the legislative branch, fielding complaints about harassment, discrimination and other workplace violations. It also stores financial information about legislative branch employees, who include not just those at the Library of Congress, lawmakers and their aides, but employees of the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, told library staffers shortly after Hayden\u2019s firing that he will serve as the acting librarian. He said in a note this week that while the White House had appointed its own acting librarian, \u201cwe have not yet received direction from Congress about how to move forward,\u201d indicating that the library was defying Trump\u2019s wishes.",
      "California Sen. Alex Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, this week said flatly that Newlen is the acting librarian of Congress. Asked whether Blanche was respecting that, Padilla said, \u201cthat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d",
      "But a White House official stressed on Thursday that Trump selected Blanche to be the acting librarian. The official, granted anonymity because of the ongoing private discussions with lawmakers, said Trump chose Blanche because the president is \u201cappointing highly-qualified individuals who are wholeheartedly committed to advancing the America-first agenda.\" The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Some suspect that the Copyright Office is the true aim of the administration. Housed in the Library of Congress with a leader chosen by the librarian, the office accepts millions of copies of copyrighted material such as books, artwork and music every year as part of the copyright registration process.",
      "Shortly before the director of the office, Shira Perlmutter, was fired, her office released a report that questioned whether it was legal for the tech industry to use copyrighted material to \u201ctrain\u201d their artificial intelligence systems. Tech companies contend that doing so is legal when used for educational or research purposes or creating something new. Perlmutter\u2019s report said doing so, in some circumstances, would go beyond established boundaries of fair use when the AI-generated content is competing with creative works made by people.",
      "The material there is extremely valuable. For instance, copyright violation damages for the office's existing collection \u2014 if, for instance, tech companies scraped the material for AI purposes and then later were found liable for copyright infringement \u2014 would likely exceed $1.5 trillion, according to a person familiar with the calculations.",
      "Morelle noted that the firing came \u201cone day after, and I doubt there\u2019s any coincidence to this, a report which is in many ways at odds with what Elon Musk wants to do around intellectual property and copyright.\u201d Musk is the billionaire outside adviser for Trump who operates his own AI startup, called xAI. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Fortnite says it\u2019s unavailable on Apple\u2019s iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe",
      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, says an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d led its Grok chatbot to post unsolicited claims on social media about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people in South Africa",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company said an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d to its chatbot Grok was the reason why it kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d on social media this week.",
      "An employee at xAI made a change that \u201cdirected Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic,\u201d which \u201cviolated xAI\u2019s internal policies and core values,\u201d the company said in an explanation posted late Thursday that promised reforms.",
      "A day earlier, Grok kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa in response to users of Musk\u2019s social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. It was echoing views shared by Musk, who was born in South Africa and frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself before the fixes were made Wednesday, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Grok's responses were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment but on Thursday, xAI said it had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation\u201d and was implementing new measures to improve Grok's transparency and reliability.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, fueling criticism in the hours between the unauthorized change \u2014 at 3:15 a.m. Pacific time Wednesday \u2014 and the company's explanation nearly two days later.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group that came after Trump suspended refugee programs and halted arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression by the Afrikaner-led apartheid government that ruled South Africa until 1994. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck said it was clear the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Musk's company said it is now making a number of changes, starting with publishing Grok system prompts openly on the software development site GitHub so that \u201cthe public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\u201d",
      "Among the instructions to Grok shown on GitHub on Thursday were: \u201cYou are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media.\u201d",
      "Noting that some had \u201ccircumvented\u201d its existing code review process, xAI also said it will \u201cput in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can\u2019t modify the prompt without review.\u201d The company said it is also putting in place a \u201c24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok\u2019s answers that are not caught by automated systems,\u201d for when other measures fail.",

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators will seek public comment on proposed changes from Microsoft for Teams, signaling the U.S. company may be nearing the end of a long-running antitrust case targeting its messaging and videoconferencing app.",
      "Microsoft had previously offered some modifications including unbundling Teams from its Office software suite in an attempt to head off the antitrust probe shortly after it was opened by the EU two years ago.",
      "But those proposals didn't satisfy the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s top competition enforcer, which accused Microsoft last year of potentially abusive behavior.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The internet wouldn't be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip.",
      "Like it or not, the button has served as a creative catalyst, a dopamine delivery system and an emotional battering ram. It also became an international tourist attraction after Facebook plastered the symbol on a giant sign on that stood outside its Silicon Valley headquarters until the company rebranded itself as Meta Platforms in 2021.",
      "A new book, \u201cLike: The Button That Changed The World,\" delves into the convoluted story behind a symbol that's become both the manna and bane of a digitally driven society.",
      "It's a tale that traces back to gladiator battles for survival during the Roman empire before fast-forwarding to the early 21st century when technology trailblazers such as Yelp co-founder Russ Simmons, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, and Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit were experimenting with different ways using the currency of recognition to prod people to post compelling content online for free.",
      "As part of that noodling, a Yelp employee named Bob Goodson sat down on May 18, 2005, and drew a crude sketch of thumbs up and thumbs down gesture as a way for people to express their opinions about restaurant reviews posted on the site. Yelp passed on adopting Goodson's suggested symbol and, instead, adopted the \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d buttons conceived by Simmons. But the discovery of that old sketch inspired Goodson to team up with Martin Reeves to explore how the Like button came to be in their new book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something simple and also elegant because the Like button says, \u2018I like you, I like your content. And I am like you. I like you because I am like you, I am part of your tribe,\u2019 \u201d Reeves said during an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cBut it's very hard to answer the simple question, \u2018Well, who invented the Like button?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Although Facebook is the main reason the Like button became so ubiquitous, the company didn't invent it and almost discarded it as drivel. It took Facebook nearly two years to overcome the staunch resistance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg before finally introducing the symbol on its service on February 9, 2009 \u2014 five years after the social network's creation in a Harvard University dorm room.",
      "As happens with many innovations, the Like button was born out of necessity but it wasn't the brainchild of a single person. The concept percolated for more than a decade in a Silicon Valley before Facebook finally embraced it.",
      "\u201cInnovation is often social and Silicon Valley was the right place for all this happen because it has a culture of meet-ups, although it's less so now,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEveryone was getting together to talk about what they were working on at that time and it turned out a lot of them were working on the same stuff.\u201d",
      "The effort to create a simple mechanism to digitally express approval or dismay sprouted from a wellspring of online services such as Yelp and YouTube whose success would hinge on their ability to post commentary or video that would help make their sites even more popular without forcing them to spend a lot of money for content. That effort required a feedback loop that wouldn't require a lot of hoops to navigate.",
      "And when Goodson was noodling around with his thumbs-up and thumbs-down gesture, it didn't come out of a vacuum. Those techniques of signaling approval and disapproval had been ushered into the 21st century zeitgeist by the Academy Award-winning movie, \u201cGladiator,\u201d where Emperor Commodus \u2014 portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix \u2014 used the gestures to either spare or slay combatants in the arena.",
      "But the positive feelings conjured by a thumbs up date even further back in popular culture, thanks to the 1950s-era character Fonzie played by Henry Winkler in the top-rated 1970s TV series, \u201cHappy Days.\u201d The gesture later became a way of expressing delight with a program via a remote control button for the digital video recorders made by TiVO during the early 2000s. Around the same time, Hot or Not \u2014 a site that solicited feedback on the looks of people who shared photos of themselves \u2014 began playing around with ideas that helped inspire the Like button, based on the book's research.",
      "Others that contributed to the pool of helpful ideas included the pioneering news service Digg, the blogging platform Xanga, YouTube and another early video site, Vimeo.",
      "But Facebook unquestionably turned the Like button into a universally understood symbol, while also profiting the most from its entrance into the mainstream. And it almost didn't happen.",
      "By 2007, Facebook engineers had been tinkering with a Like button, but Zuckerberg opposed it because he feared the social network was already getting too cluttered and, Reeves said, \u201cis he didn\u2019t actually want to do something that would be seen as trivial, that would cheapen the service.\u201d",
      "But FriendFeed, a rival social network created by Buchheit and now OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, had no such qualms, and unveiled its own Like button in October 2007.",
      "But the button wasn't successful enough to keep the lights on at FriendFeed, and the service ended up being acquired by Facebook. By the time that deal was completed, Facebook had already introduced a Like button \u2014 only after Zuckerberg rebuffed the original idea of calling it an Awesome button \u201cbecause nothing is more awesome than awesome,\u201d according to the book's research.",
      "Once Zuckerberg relented, Facebook quickly saw that the Like button not only helped keep its audience engaged on its social network but also made it easier to divine people's individual interests and gather the insights required to sell the targeted advertising that accounted for most of Meta Platform's $165 billion in revenue last year. The button's success encouraged Facebook to take things even further by allowing other digital services to ingrain it into their feedback loops and then, in 2016, added six more types of emotions \u2014 \u201clove,\u201d \u201ccare,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d \u201cwow,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d",
      "Facebook hasn't publicly disclosed how many responses it has accumulated from the Like button and its other related options, but Levchin told the book's authors that he believes the company has probably logged trillions of them. \u201cWhat content is liked by humans...is probably one of the singularly most valuable things on the internet,\u201d Levchin said in the book.",
      "The Like button also has created an epidemic of emotional problems, especially among adolescents, who feel forlorn if their posts are ignored and narcissists whose egos feast on the positive feedback. Reeves views those issues as part of the unintentional consequences that inevitably happen because \u201cif you can\u2019t even predict the beneficial effects of a technological innovation how could you possibly forecast the side effects and the interventions?\u201d",
      "Even so, Reeves believes the Like button and the forces that coalesced to create it tapped into something uniquely human.",
      "\u201cWe thought serendipity of the innovation was part of the point,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can get bored with liking or having our capacity to compliment taken away so easily because it\u2019s the product of 100,000 years of evolution.\u201d",

      "A 29-year-old former tire shop manager who quit his job and cashed in his retirement savings to buy a sailboat has become a social media sensation as he sails from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix",
      "HONOLULU -- Midway while sailing across the Pacific with just his cat named Phoenix, Oliver Widger reflected on why he thinks his many followers \u2014 more than a million on TikTok and Instagram \u2014 are drawn to his story of quitting his 9-to-5 job and embarking on a journey from Oregon to Hawaii.",
      "\u201cThe world kind of sucks and, like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in how I felt with my work,\u201d Widger, 29, told The Associated Press on Wednesday via Zoom. \u201cYou can be making $150,000 a year and you still feel like you\u2019re just making ends meet, you know what I mean? And I think people are just tired of that and working really hard for nothing and want a way out.\"",
      "People are inspired by someone who found a way out, said Widger, who is among a growing number of people who have undertaken such voyages in recent years.",
      "Being diagnosed four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis made him realize he hated his job as a manager at a tire company, a job requiring him to be clean-shaven and wear pressed shirts. He heard about people who sailed from California to Hawaii and decided that was the life for him.",
      "He abruptly quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt.",
      "\u201cI knew one thing: I'm buying a sailboat,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI'm sailing around the world.\u201d",
      "He liquidated his retirement savings, taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast, where he spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.",
      "Now, Widger is harnessing the power of social media to fund his round-the-world sailing dream.",
      "Since he set sail in April, followers have been tuning into his \u201cSailing with Phoenix\u201d social media posts to view videos of him and his feline first mate battling the waves and bouts of seasickness, enjoying dazzling sunsets, recounting tricky boat repairs or just reflecting on life at sea.",
      "As he discussed his journey with the AP, a netted bag carrying bottled water and snacks swung wildly over his head as the boat rocked.",
      "He recalled highlights of the voyage so far, including marveling at the speed dolphins cut through the water and finding flying fish on the deck. There have been stretches when there were no birds in sight for days. It can be a struggle to sleep when the boat is creaking while being buffeted by waves or to steady a boiling pot for the MREs he has been subsisting on.",
      "There have been harrowing moments like when a rudder failed and the boat tilted sideways in the surf for three hours as he made repairs, and the time he locked himself in the engine compartment and pried his way out with a wrench.",
      "Widger acknowledged he is relatively inexperienced as a sailor, but he has implemented safety measures and communication backup plans, including a satellite phone and an emergency beacon.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Jesse Harms of the U.S. Coast Guard in Hawaii hasn't been following the journey closely, but said he is relieved to hear Widger has the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, known as an EPIRB.",
      "It's a critical tool for rescuers to locate a mariner's position during an emergency, especially in the Pacific, the largest ocean, Harms said.",
      "Widger's journey provides a good opportunity to educate the public about sailing safety, such as the importance of wearing a personal flotation device whenever topside on the boat, monitoring the weather closely and registering emergency tools like the EPIRB, Harms said.",
      "\u201cThat's a really critical piece for anybody that's getting motivated by his story to go set off on their own adventure,\u201d Harms said.",
      "Until his arrival, likely in Honolulu, Widger is making sure everything is in place to avoid Phoenix having to undergo Hawaii's animal quarantine. A mobile vet will sign off on Phoenix's health when they arrive, he said.",
      "Widger wasn't aware of the deadly danger of cat feces to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, but he has been keeping all his trash, including kitty litter, on board. Even though he said he is legally allowed to throw it overboard, seeing so much plastic in the ocean motivates him not to.",
      "In addition to managing the practicalities of daily life on a boat, he is coping with going viral in the middle of the ocean by creating social media content and making decisions about merch his fans want to buy.",
      "He credits it all to his neck issue, which \u201cshook up my world and it changed my perspective on everything.\u201d He also hopes he can be an inspiration for anyone who's in a rut.",
      "\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done I thought was impossible,\u201d Widger said. \"Sailing around the world is such a ridiculous dream. Whatever your dream is, just go, just do it.\u201d",

      "The planned network includes vertiports at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum south of downtown, which are slated to share opening and closing ceremonies. Other locations are Los Angeles International Airport, Hollywood, Santa Monica and Orange County.",
      "\u201cWe want to transform the way people get around Los Angeles and leave a legacy that shapes the future of transportation in America,\" Adam Goldstein, CEO and founder of Archer Aviation, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s no better time to do that than during the LA28 Games.\u201d",

The eVTOL aircraft is built with redundant, fault-tolerant systems, including 12 total engines and propellers, allowing Archer to target certification with the FAA at similar levels of safety as commercial airliners. The air taxis are made at the company's manufacturing plants in San Jose, California, and Covington, Georgia.",

      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him",
      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.",
      "Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he\u2019s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.",
      "Knowing KJ\u2019s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.",
      "\u201cWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Nicole said.",
      "\u201cWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,\u201d her husband added.",
      "Within six months, the team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ\u2019s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA \u201cletter\u201d \u2014 also known as a base \u2014 to the correct type. Known as \u201cbase editing,\" it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cvery exciting\u201d that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.\u201d",
      "In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.",
      "While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, \u201che slept through the entire thing,\u201d recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.",
      "After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 \u00bd-month old also takes less medication.",
      "Considering his poor prognosis earlier, \u201cany time we see even the smallest milestone that he\u2019s meeting \u2013 like a little wave or rolling over \u2013 that\u2019s a big moment for us,\u201d his mother said.",
      "Still, researchers caution that it\u2019s only been a few months. They\u2019ll need to watch him for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,\u201d Ahrens-Nicklas said. \u201cBut every day, he\u2019s showing us signs that he\u2019s growing and thriving.\u201d",
      "Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.",
      "Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.",
      "Musunuru said his team\u2019s work \u2014 funded in part by the National Institutes of Health \u2014 showed that creating a custom treatment doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was \u201cnot far off\u201d from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.",
      "\u201cAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,\u201d Musunuru said.",
      "Scientists also won't have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research \u201csets the stage\u201d for treating other rare conditions.",
      "Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn't involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.",
      "\u201cOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time\" for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. \u201cThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years. Then the whole field will move as a block because we\u2019re pretty much ready.\u201d",

      "All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence",
      "MEXICO CITY -- All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence.",
      "The nongovernmental organization\u2019s business account had been blocked. Weeks later, a similar digital blackout struck a collective in Colombia.",
      "Across the Americas, organizations that guide women seeking abortions in various countries are raising alarm, decrying what they see as a new wave of censorship on platforms owned by tech giant Meta \u2014 even in countries where abortion is decriminalized. The organizations believe this is due to a combination of changes to Meta policies and attacks by anti-abortion groups that denounce their content.",
      "While this also occurs on Instagram and Facebook, the blocking of organizations\u2019 verified WhatsApp business accounts, which they use to communicate with people seeking help, has been particularly disruptive. These accounts are crucial for communicating with people seeking help, and their blockage has significantly complicated daily interactions between women and support providers.",
      "Meta usually attributes its content blocking to policy violations, though it has acknowledged occasional mistakes. Since January, Meta changed the way it moderates content, now relying on user-generated notes \u201cto allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump has said the changes were \u201cprobably\u201d made in response to his threats over what conservatives considered a liberal bias in fact-checking.",
      "Among the organizations whose WhatsApp business accounts were suspended is the MSI Foundation (part of MSI Reproductive Choices, formerly Marie Stopes) a network working in Mexico for 25 years. Its account was suspended in February, and the Colombian group Ori\u00e9ntame, or Guide Me, which has worked in women's health in Colombia for decades, was labeled by Instagram as \u201cdangerous.\u201d",
      "While conservatives cheered the change in Meta moderation policies, organizations helping women who seek abortions say that, even if they just apply in the U.S., they often result in over-enforcement, likely driven by Artificial Intelligence, which disproportionately flags or removes their posts \u2014 obstacles that have increased since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt is not always intentional censorship, but the outcome is still more censorship for us and our partners,\u201d said Martha Dimitratou, cofounder of Repro Uncensored, an organization that monitors digital suppression of reproductive health content.",
      "In additional comments on Thursday, Meta rejected any link between the groups\u2019 experiences and its policy changes.",
      "\u201cOur policies and enforcement regarding abortion medication-related content have not changed recently and were not part of the content moderation changes,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFrom one day to the next they blocked communication between our users and women who need first-hand information\u201d to address doubts or look for medical follow-up with MSI, said Araceli L\u00f3pez-Nava, the organization\u2019s Latin America director.",
      "In the days after the suspension, appointments dropped 80%",
      "L\u00f3pez Nava said that MSI had previously faced issues with regular WhatsApp numbers, because it\u2019s easy to file complaints. So, the organization thought it would be different with a business account, which gives them a platform to manage the thousands of messages they receive every month.",
      "That wasn't the case. After an initial suspension, MSI's WhatsApp business account was permanently suspended two weeks later. The reason cited in Meta\u2019s notification? \u201cSending spam.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe argument is that they\u2019ve received complaints, but from whom?\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava asked. She said the organization can\u2019t be accused of sending spam because they only answer those who contact them and provide information in line with Mexican law. Abortion is decriminalized in Mexico at the federal level and in the majority of its 32 states.",
      "\u201cIt looks like an orchestrated strategy to us,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava said. \u201cAnd not necessarily by Meta.\"",
      "Dimitratou, who is also digital strategist for Canada-based Women on Web and the U.S.-based Plan C, said cases of blocked content have increased since Trump\u2019s election, not only in the U.S., but around the world, likely driven by anti-abortion groups.",
      "Conservative or religious groups have a history of attempting to leverage technology companies to obstruct abortion supporters\u2019 efforts, but the anonymity of app reporting prevents organizations from proving who is behind it.",
      "That is why MSI and an ally NGO, Women\u2019s Link Worldwide, have asked Meta to implement transparent mechanisms to be able to appeal the company\u2019s decisions and to respect international human rights standards. They have not received a response.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told The Associated Press that MSI's WhatsApp business account was blocked for valid reasons, saying that organizations receiving numerous negative comments receive warnings before suspension. Meta declined to provide details about the nature of the negative comments or comment on whether they could be coordinated by anti-abortion groups aiming to paralyze MSI.",
      "The Instagram accounts of Women on Web United States and Women on Web Latin America were suspended right after the U.S. presidential election in November, though they were later reinstated. Dimitratou said that Meta has also limited the organization\u2019s ability to place ads on accounts in Latin America, South Korea and West Africa.",
      "Repro Uncensored has documented at least 60 instances of similar digital censorship since January. The most recent occurred this week, when Thailand's TamTang Group said that Facebook had accused them of violating rules on selling medicines simply for sharing information about free abortion pills provided by the Thai government.",
      "A 2025 report by the California-based Center for Intimacy Justice, based on a survey of 159 nonprofits worldwide, found that major tech platforms were removing ads and content related to abortion and other women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health issues like menopause.",
      "When asked about the report, Meta downplayed its findings, noting that it was based on a small number of examples.",
      "Tech companies often cite policies against explicit or inappropriate sexual content or the advertisement of unsafe substances, such as abortion pills, even though the World Health Organization has said they\u2019re safe.",
      "In April, months after Meta announced changes to ensure greater freedom of expression, Ori\u00e9ntame, the Colombian collective that offers reproductive health services, posted on Instagram a drawing of a heart and the phrase \u201cAbort without pain.\u201d The post was blocked with the explanation: \u201cDangerous people and organizations, photo removed.\u201d",
      "While Colombia legalized abortion in 2022, Ori\u00e9ntame experienced censorship of at least 14 of their posts on Instagram in April 2025. That same month, their WhatsApp business account was suspended, said Tatiana Mart\u00ednez, who manages their social media. Although the WhatsApp account was restored after a week, they worry it could happen again.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said this week that the Instagram posts were mistakenly taken down and not the result of a change in its content standards.",
      "Ori\u00e9ntame director Mar\u00eda Vivas says the organization has been battling Google for years over online content limitations. The tech giant said in a message to the AP that it only restricts content when it violates policies. But Google keeps Colombia on the list of countries with restrictions on abortion ads \u2014 even though abortion was decriminalized there in 2022.",
      "As for their problems with Meta, Vivas said they started in late 2024, when the company started to make some data management adjustments.",

      "NEW YORK -- Responding to complaints from the tech industry and other countries, the U.S. Department of Commerce has rescinded a Biden-era rule due to take effect Thursday that placed limits on the number of artificial intelligence chips that could be exported to certain international markets without federal approval.",
      "\u201cThese new requirements would have stifled American innovation and saddled companies with burdensome new regulatory requirements,\u201d the Commerce Department stated in its guidance.",

While the United States had already restricted exports to adversaries such as China and Russia, some of those controls had loopholes and the rule would have set limits on a much broader group of countries, including Middle Eastern countries that President Donald Trump is visiting this week.",
      "The Biden rule's sorting more than 100 countries into different tiers of export restrictions drew strong opposition from those countries, as well as U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. They argued the restrictions could actually push some countries to turn to China instead of the U.S. for their AI technology.",

      "A Brazilian scientist whose work shows farmers how to shift crop production toward more biologically based solutions instead of chemical fertilizers is being honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- A Brazilian scientist who pushed back against chemical fertilizers and researched biologically based approaches to more robust food production has been honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize, the organization announced Tuesday.",
      "Microbiologist Mariangela Hungria's research helped her country become an agricultural powerhouse, an accomplishment that has now won her $500,000 from the Iowa-based World Food Prize Foundation. Hungria has been researching biological seed and soil treatments for 40 years, and has worked with Brazilian farmers to implement her findings.",
      "\u201cI still cannot believe it. Everybody said, my whole life, it's improbable, you are going the wrong way, just go to things like chemicals and so on. And then, I received the most important prize in the world of agriculture,\" Hungria said in an interview. \"Sometimes I still think I'll wake up and see that it's not true.\u201d",
      "Norman Borlaug, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work to dramatically increase crop yields and reduce the threat of starvation in many countries, founded the World Food Prize. Since the first prize was handed out in 1987, 55 people have been honored.",
      "Hungria said she grew up wanting to alleviate hunger. Early in her career, she decided to focus on a process called biological nitrogen fixation, in which soil bacteria could be used to promote plant growth. At that time, farmers in Brazil and around the world were reluctant to reduce their use of nitrogen fertilizers, which dramatically increase crop production but lead to greenhouse gas emissions and pollutes waterways.",
      "Hungria studied how bacteria can interact with plant roots to naturally produce nitrogen. She then demonstrated her work on test plots and began working directly with farmers to convince them that they wouldn't have to sacrifice high crop yields if they switched to a biological process.",
      "The work is credited for increasing yields of several crops, including wheat, corn and beans, but it has been especially affective on soybeans. Brazil has since become the world's largest soybean producer, surpassing the United States and Argentina.",
      "Although Hungria's research could be applied on farms in other countries, soybean production in the U.S. is different than it is in Brazil; American farmers typically rotate crops on their land between growing corn and soybeans. Enough nitrate fertilizer applied to corn still remains in the soil when soybeans are planted that little or no fertilizer needs to be applied, Hungria said.",
      "Brazilian agricultural companies have faced fierce criticism for clearing forested land to create farmland, largely to grow soybeans.",
      "Much of that criticism is justified, Hungria said, but she added that her biological approach builds up the soil and makes further encroachment into forested areas less necessary.",
      "\u201cIf you manage the crop well, the crop will enrich the soil with nitrogen. Soil health improves if you do the right things,\u201d she said.",
      "Hungria will be awarded her prize at an annual October gathering in Des Moines, Iowa, of agricultural researchers and officials from around the world.",
      "Gebisa Ejeta, chair of the World Food Prize Laureate Selection Committee, credited Hungria for her \u201cextraordinary scientific achievements\u201d that have transformed agriculture in South America.",
      "\"Her brilliant scientific work and her committed vision for advancing sustainable crop production to feed humanity with judicious use of chemical fertilizer inputs and biological amendments has gained her global recognition both at home and abroad,\u201d Ejeta said in a statement.",

      "Major social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and X have failed to protect LGBTQ+ users from hate and harassment, in part, because they intentionally rolled back previous safety practices, the advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday in its annual So...",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Major social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and X have failed to protect LGBTQ+ users from hate and harassment, in part, because they intentionally rolled back previous safety practices, the advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday in its annual Social Media Safety Index.",
      "The report said that recent \u201cunprecedented hate speech policy rollbacks\u201d from Instagram and Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google's YouTube are \u201cactively undermining the safety of LGBTQ people\u201d both online and offline. Meta\u2019s rollback now allows users to call LGBTQ people \u201cmentally ill,\u201d among other policy changes.",
      "The scorecard assigns numeric ratings to each platform with regard to LGBTQ safety, privacy, and expression. Elon Musk's X received the lowest score at 30 out of 100, while TikTok came in highest at 56. Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Google's YouTube were in the 40s. The group's methodology has changed since last year, so the scores are not directly comparable to previous reports.",
      "\u201cAt a time when real-world violence and harassment against LGBTQ people is on the rise, social media companies are profiting from the flames of anti-LGBTQ hate instead of ensuring the basic safety of LGBTQ users,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO.",
      "While X has received the lowest scores since Musk's takeover of the platform in 2022 \u2014 when it was called Twitter \u2014 Meta's backslide can largely be attributed to its recent policy shift. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that Meta is removing restrictions on topics like immigration and gender \u201cthat are out of touch with mainstream discourse,\u201d citing \u201crecent elections\u201d as a catalyst. GLAAD calls the rollback \u201dparticularly extreme.\"",
      "Representatives for Meta, TikTok and X did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday afternoon.",
      "GLAAD said Google recently removed \u201cgender identity and expression\u201d from YouTube's list of protected characteristic groups, which suggests that the platform is \"no longer protecting transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people from hate and discrimination.\"",
      "Google says this is not the case.",
      "\u201cWe confirmed earlier this year our hate speech policy hasn\u2019t changed. We have strict policies against content that promotes hatred or violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community and we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to quickly detect and remove this content,\u201d Google said in a statement.",
      "Although GLAAD acknowledges Google's statement, the organization stresses that gender identity has not been restored as a protected characteristic on YouTube's hate speech policy page.",
      "\u201cYouTube should reverse this dangerous policy change and update its \u2018Hate Speech\u2019 policy to expressly include gender identity and expression as a protected characteristic,\u201d the report says.",
      "GLAAD's report makes policy recommendations for protecting LGBTQ users, though it's unclear if the platforms will take these up, given that many have rolled back such protections. For instance, GLAAD says platforms should protect LGBTQ people from hate, harassment and violence, prohibit targeted misgendering and \u201cdeadnaming\u201d of transgender users and explain steps it takes to stop wrongfully removing or demonetizing legitimate accounts and content related to LGBTQ topics.",

    "story": [
      "Cuts to Medicaid could increase the number of uninsured.",
      "Key components of the bill to fund President Donald Trump's agenda looks to provide major tax breaks by cutting spending elsewhere, including massive cuts to Medicaid.",
      "Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) works with state programs to administer Medicaid, under which more than 71.2 million people are enrolled.",
      "Medicaid offers benefits including nursing home care, personal care services and assistance paying for premiums and other costs, according to CMS.",
      "An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates cuts to Medicaid could increase the number of people without health insurance by at least 8.6 million by 2034.",
      "\"Medicaid is an important safety net for so many Americans,\" Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, told ABC News. \"When we look at the most vulnerable and most underserved, it's going to impact these groups disproportionately.\"",
      "Many Republicans have insisted that cuts to Medicaid are only to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse and will not result in lost coverage for those who need it, which was repeated during testimony this week by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "But some Americans who rely on Medicaid for their own coverage, or coverage for their families, told ABC News they're worried that cuts could reduce their ability to receive health care, or force them to choose between paying for coverage or paying for necessities.",
      "'I feel very scared'",
      "Rosa Andresen, from Southgate, California, has been her 27-year-old daughter's caregiver for the past 13 years.",
      "Her daughter, Amanda, is disabled and has conditions including cerebral palsy and a seizure disorder. Over a decade ago, Andresen left her job at a data entry retrieval company to care for her daughter full time.",
      "Andresen, 54, said Amanda is covered by Medicare and Medicaid, which has helped pay for diapers, seizure medication and mobility tools such as a shower chair and a ramp to help her go up and down stairs.",
      "It's unclear if Amanda would lose Medicaid coverage under the new proposal but, if she did, it would be a massive blow to her care, Andresen said.",
      "\"It's very devastating,\" Andresen told ABC News. \"I'm very, very sad, and I feel very scared for my daughter's well-being. It could drastically affect her health and her life, the quality of life that she has.\"",
      "Andresen said she is scared that she will receive a letter in the mail telling her that her daughter is no longer eligible for Medicaid or she'll take Amanda to a doctor's appointment and find out that her daughter cannot receive care there or can no longer be prescribed a certain medication.",
      "She said she has tried to see if she could get private insurance for her daughter, such as through her husband's job, but insurance companies allegedly told her they don't cover people with chronic illnesses.",
      "According to the HHS, \"health insurers can no longer charge more or deny coverage to you or your child because of a pre-existing health condition like asthma, diabetes, or cancer, as well as pregnancy\".",
      "While California does have Medi-Cal, which is the state's implementation of the federal Medicaid program, Andresen said she doesn't know what the program would cover and what she would have to pay out of pocket.",
      "\"I use government assistance to buy food, like the [electronic benefit transfer], to put food at my table and if I have to also use money out of my pocket, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it if I [have to] decide to buy my daughter's medication or put food on the table,\" Andresen said.",
      "Work requirements could jeopardize care",
      "Four years ago, Jodie Montplaisir, a mother-of-five from North Hampton, Massachusetts, was struggling with opioid use disorder. She was unhoused, unemployed and separated from her children.",
      "Montplaisir said she realized she had hit a low point and needed help. She entered an opioid treatment program (OTP), paid for by Medicaid.",
      "\"I really just was like, 'I need to fix my life,' and I did,\" Montplaisir, 38, told ABC News. \"I really stuck in with the clinic and doing all of the meetings, all the groups, all my therapy, just really utilizing the clinic \u2026 and they really helped me.\"",
      "Montplaisir is now three years into her recovery, currently living in an apartment, reunited with her children and has a job working with unhoused people.",
      "Medicaid currently covers her medication-assisted treatment, and she attends clinic weekly to stay accountable. However, she fears any interruption, such as red tape or new requirements, could jeopardize her progress.",
      "\"If I didn't have Medicaid, I wouldn't have been able to do the clinic,\" she said. \"There's absolutely no way possible. If I didn't have Medicaid and the help of the system, I wouldn't have been able to do it alone.\"",
      "The Republicans' proposed bill would impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients -- at least 80 hours per month -- or require enrolling in an educational program for at least 80 hours or some combination per month.",
      "Not all Republicans are in favor the bill in its current form. A growing number of House GOP members are expressing grievances, some because they don't believe the bill does enough to protect vulnerable Americans and others because it does not include some of the most drastic cuts that Republican hardliners were pushing for.",
      "Montplaisir said if work requirements were in place when she was in OTP, it would have made it impossible for her to focus on her recovery, and it will make it difficult for the unhoused people she now works with.",
      "While the draft language has exemptions for certain adults, including those who have substance use disorder, Montplaisir worries proving an exemption could be complex and may result in lost coverage anyway.",
      "Additionally, trying to prove work requirements as opposed to focusing on recovery could derail people's progress, she said.",
      "\"Medicaid is there to help us ... how we supposed to work if we're trying to get sober?\" Montplaisir said. \"If I had to have paid money while I'm trying to get sober or having to work while I'm trying to get sober, it wouldn't work.\"",

      "Details vary by state, but many efforts contain at least some aspects of a four-pronged plan outlined two years ago by a pair of conservative think tanks. The legislative model promoted by the Manhattan Institute and the Goldwater Institute focused on higher education, seeking to abolish DEI offices and staff, end mandatory diversity training, ban compulsory diversity statements and outlaw racial or sexual preferences in hiring and admissions.",
      "Now Republican-led states are using the same model to prohibit DEI initiatives in state and local governments.",
      "\u201cDespite the Trump administration taking action, the states cannot rely on the federal government to root out DEI for them,\u201d said Timothy Minella, senior fellow at the Goldwater Institute.",
      "Efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion have existed for years in higher education institutions, businesses and government bureaucracies. Supporters say such initiatives benefit everyone by helping people navigate diverse societies and understand people's differing viewpoints and experiences. Their goal is to promote student bodies and workplaces where everyone feels valued.",
      "That is why some DEI offices have tailored services to people of particular races, genders, sexual orientations and cultures and disabilities. Some institutions also have factored in equity goals when admitting students, providing scholarships or making employment decisions, to try to reflect society at large.",
      "Findings in a poll conducted earlier this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show that while \u201cDEI\u201d has become a politically toxic term for many Americans, some components of DEI programs have much less opposition.",
      "The poll found about 4 in 10 Americans \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favor DEI programs in colleges and universities, while about 3 in 10 oppose those initiatives and about 3 in 10 are neutral.",
      "Support is higher for courses on racism and scholarships for students of color, among other services designed to help students from underrepresented groups.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration required diversity and equity goals in various government programs.",
      "Trump has reversed those efforts, denouncing DEI policies as a form of discrimination that threatens merit-based decision-making. The Republican roll-back gained momentum after the Supreme Court in 2023 struck down racial affirmative action in college admissions. With Trump's return to the presidency, a growing number of businesses have voluntarily withdrawn their DEI programs.",
      "There is no universal definition about what\u2019s covered by those initiatives. But most state laws and gubernatorial orders focus on initiatives related to race, ethnicity, gender or sex.",
      "Some measures, such bills passed in Oklahoma and Wyoming, further narrow their definition of DEI activities to those that grant preferential or differential treatment of individuals based on such factors.",
      "The state measures don\u2019t typically mention people with disabilities, military veterans or those from lower-income households, even though they might also be included in an institution's equity efforts, said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.",
      "\u201cDiversity, equity and inclusion efforts extends well beyond race, gender and sexuality, but it has been framed in ways that targets those populations and demonize those populations,\u201d she said.",
      "Some workers targeted by Trump\u2019s anti-DEI measures claim they are being used to justify firing people who happen to be minorities and women. One class-action complaint by federal workers alleges that Trump\u2019s anti-DEI executive orders discriminate against employees who aren\u2019t white men.",
      "Limits on DEI initiatives in higher education recently approved by legislatures in Missouri and Oklahoma raise the total number of similar state laws and gubernatorial orders to two dozen since 2023. That includes bills passed earlier this year in Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming. More are under consideration in additional states.",
      "The Missouri measures show the growth of the movement. A provision limiting DEI in higher education got left out of the state budget last year. But it got included this year after new Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe issued an order barring executive agencies from using state funds on DEI positions and activities.",
      "New laws in Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming target DEI initiatives in state and local governments as well as higher education.",
      "More governors are issuing directives now.",
      "On his first day in office in West Virginia in January, Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey ordered an end to DEI staff positions and activities that grant preferential treatment based on race, ethnicity or sex in executive departments and state-funded institutions. On his second day, Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Braun issued a similar order. Kehoe's anti-DEI order came in his second month as Missouri governor.",
      "Texas was among the first states in 2023 to legislate against spending on DEI programs in higher education. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott expanded upon that this year, ordering all state agencies to \u201ccomply with the color-blind guarantee\u201d of the U.S. and state constitutions. His executive order described DEI concepts as \u201cblatant efforts to divide people\u201d with \u201cnew forms of racism.\u201d",
      "A new Idaho law signed by Republican Gov. Brad Little not only bans DEI offices and programs in higher education but also addresses what's taught in the classroom. It prohibits colleges and universities from requiring students to take DEI-related courses to meet graduation requirements, unless they're pursuing degrees in race or gender studies.",
      "It's the first such law nationally, according to the Goldwater Institute, which teamed up with Speech First to develop a model they describe as the \u201cFreedom from Indoctrination Act.\u201d DEI opponents are hoping more states will soon follow.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to get rid of the DEI mandates for general education and programs in order to get a degree,\" Minella said.",

    "summary": "As FEMA prepares for hurricane season starting on Jun 1, the agency is ill-prepared, according to an internal document obtained by ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "The acting agency head told staff that planning is about 80-85% complete.",
      "The acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency told staff members on Thursday that he believes President Donald Trump is a bold man with a bold vision for the agency -- but that FEMA doesn't yet have a full plan to tackle hurricane season.",
      "\"I would say we're about 80 or 85% there,\" Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson told staff on a conference call, parts of which were obtained by ABC. \"The next week, we will close that gap and get to probably 97-98% of a plan. We'll never have 100% of a plan. Even if we did have 100% of a plan, a plan never survives first contact. However, we will do our best to make sure that the plan is all-encompassing.\"",
      "The conference call came after an internal document prepared for Richardson as he takes the helm of the agency responsible for managing federal disasters indicated the agency was ill-prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, which starts on June 1.",
      "\"As FEMA transforms to a smaller footprint, the intent for this hurricane season is not well understood, thus FEMA is not ready,\" according to the document, which was obtained by ABC News.",
      "In the conference call, Richardson said he and staff sat down for \"about 90 minutes\" and started to come up with a plan for this year's disaster season.",
      "He said the plan would be ready soon.",
      "\"Listen closely: The intent for disaster season 2025 (is to) safeguard the American people, return primacy to the states, strengthen their capability to respond and recover, and coordinate federal assistance when deemed necessary, while transforming to the future of FEMA,\" Richardson said.",
      "Richardson was placed at FEMA by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after former acting Administrator Cam Hamilton was fired last week because of his testimony in front of a House panel, according to a source familiar with the matter, which went against the shuttering of the agency.",
      "The acting administrator said this version of FEMA will look different than the agency of the past.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s intent for FEMA is to ensure that FEMA is only doing the things in law that it should be doing,\u201d he said during the conference call, adding there is a \u201clarge push\u201d to get resources to the states.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine that makes FEMA look very, very different. What it's going to look like in the end, we'll find out,\u201d he told staff. \u201cRemember, the president's a bold man. The president has a bold vision, he makes bold statements.\"",
      "The earlier document about the agency's hurricane planning said that staffing limitations, hiring and a lack of coordination with states will also impact FEMA's operations heading into hurricane season.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told ABC News earlier that the information in the document is \"grossly out of context.\"",
      "\"You are referencing one line on a nineteen-page slide deck and the unsubstantiated opinion of one official inside the agency,\" a DHS spokesperson said. \"The slide was used during a daily meeting Acting Administrator David Richardson has held every day titled Hurricane Readiness Complex Problem Solving. In other words, exactly what the head of an emergency management agency should be doing before Hurricane Season. This is just another example of a long line of internal leaks from people who clearly couldn't care less about Americans facing disaster and prefer to manufacture petty drama for their own self-aggrandizement. Under Secretary Noem's leadership, and the efforts of Acting Administrator Richardson FEMA is fully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season.\"",
      "At his first all-hands meeting last week, Richardson told employees to not get in his way when he is trying to achieve the president's objectives, a source told ABC News.",
      "\"Don't get in my way if you're those 20% of the people,\" he told employees last Friday morning, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. \"I know all the tricks.\"",
      "\"Obfuscation. Delay. Undermining. If you're one of those 20% of the people and you think those tactics and techniques are going to help you, they will not because I will run right over you,\" he said, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. \"I will achieve the president's intent. I am as bent on achieving the president's intent as I was on making sure that I did my duty when I took my Marines to Iraq.\"",
      "Morale at FEMA has been sinking since Noem said she was going to eliminate the agency, according to sources within the agency.",
      "Noem was pressed during a House panel on Wednesday about whether she has a plan to eliminate FEMA. She said she didn't have a plan, but said the White House would be coming forward with a plan.",
      "\"There is no formalized final plan for how this goes forward, because the input of Congress is critically important,\" she told Rep. Bennie Thompson.",

      "Beginning next school year, the curriculum standards for Oklahoma high school students will including conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma high school students studying U.S. history learn about the Industrial Revolution, women\u2019s suffrage and America's expanding role in international affairs.",
      "Beginning next school year, they will add conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s new social studies standards for K-12 public school students, already infused with references to the Bible and national pride, were revised at the direction of state School Superintendent Ryan Walters. The Republican official has spent much of his first term in office lauding President Donald Trump, feuding with teachers unions and local school superintendents, and trying to end what he describes as \u201cwokeness\u201d in public schools.",
      "\u201cThe left has been pushing left-wing indoctrination in the classroom,\u201d Walters said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving it back to actually understanding history ... and I\u2019m unapologetic about that.\u201d",
      "The previous standard for studying the 2020 election merely said, \u201cExamine issues related to the election of 2020 and its outcome.\" The new version is more expansive: \u201cIdentify discrepancies in 2020 elections results by looking at graphs and other information, including the sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, the security risks of mail-in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters, and the unprecedented contradiction of \u2018bellwether county\u2019 trends.\u201d",
      "The new standard raised red flags even among Walters' fellow Republicans, including the governor and legislative leaders. They were concerned that several last-minute changes, including the language about the 2020 election and a provision stating the source of the COVID-19 virus was a Chinese lab, were added just hours before the state school board voted on them.",
      "A group of parents and educators have filed a lawsuit asking a judge to reject the standards, arguing they were not reviewed properly and that they \u201crepresent a distorted view of social studies that intentionally favors an outdated and blatantly biased perspective.\u201d",
      "While many Oklahoma teachers have expressed outrage at the change in the standards, others say they leave plenty of room for an effective teacher to instruct students about the results of the 2020 election without misinforming them.",
      "Aaron Baker, who has taught U.S. government in high schools in Oklahoma City for more than a decade, said he\u2019s most concerned about teachers in rural, conservative parts of the state who might feel encouraged to impose their own beliefs on students.",
      "\u201cIf someone is welcoming the influence of these far-right organizations in our standards and is interested in inserting more of Christianity into our practices as teachers, then they\u2019ve become emboldened,\u201d Baker said. \u201cFor me, that is the major concern.\u201d",
      "Leaders in the Republican-led Oklahoma Legislature introduced a resolution to reject the standards, but there wasn\u2019t enough GOP support to pass it.",
      "Part of that hesitation likely stemmed from a flurry of last-minute opposition organized by pro-Trump conservative groups such as Moms for Liberty, which has a large presence in Oklahoma and threatened lawmakers who reject the standards with a primary opponent.",
      "\u201cIn the last few election cycles, grassroots conservative organizations have flipped seats across Oklahoma by holding weak Republicans accountable,\u201d the group wrote in a letter signed by several other conservative groups and GOP activists. \u201cIf you choose to side with the liberal media and make backroom deals with Democrats to block conservative reform, you will be next.\u201d",
      "After a group of parents, educators and other Oklahoma school officials worked to develop the new social studies standards, Walters assembled an executive committee consisting mostly of out-of-state pundits from conservative think-tanks to revise them. He said he wanted to focus more on American exceptionalism and incorporate the Bible as an instructional resource.",
      "Among those Walters appointed to the review committee are Kevin Roberts, the president of The Heritage Foundation and a key figure in its Project 2025 blueprint for a conservative administration, and Dennis Prager, a radio talk show host who founded Prager U, a conservative nonprofit that offers \u201cpro-American\u201d educational materials for children that some critics say are not accurate or objective.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, Walters defended teaching students about \u201cunprecedented and historically significant\u201d elements of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\"The standards do not instruct students on what to believe; rather, they encourage critical thinking by inviting students to examine real events, review publicly available information, and come to their own conclusions,\u201d he said.",
      "Recounts, reviews and audits in the battleground states were Trump contested his loss all confirmed Democrat Joe Biden's victory, and Trump lost dozens of court cases challenging the results.",
      "Critics say Walters' new standard is filled with misleading phrasing that seeks to steer the discussion in particular direction.",
      "Democrats characterized it as another political ploy by Walters, widely viewed as a potential candidate for governor in 2026, at the expense of school children.",
      "\u201cIt's harmful posturing and political theater that our kids do not need to be subjected to,\u201d said Sen. Mark Mann, a Democrat from Oklahoma City who previously served on the school board for one of the state's largest districts.",
      "National experts on education standards also expressed alarm, noting that Oklahoma has historically ranked highly among the states for its standards.",
      "Brendan Gillis, the director of teaching and learning at the American Historical Association who oversaw a research project that analyzed standards in all 50 states, said Oklahoma\u2019s social studies standards had been \u201cquite good\u201d until the latest version.",
      "In addition to concerns about election misinformation, Gillis added: \u201cThere was also a lot of biblical content that was sort of shoehorned in throughout the existing standards.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Testimony in the sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs began this week, opening a window into what prosecutors say was the sordid world of group sex, drugs and violence beneath the glittering, jet set persona cultivated by the Bad Boy Records founder.",
      "Much of the testimony was hard to watch. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie, recounted being beaten and pressured into degrading sexual performances with strangers.",
      "Here are five key moments from the trial, which resumes Monday:",
      "Lawyer Teny Geragos took a novel approach to defending Combs in her opening statement.",
      "She conceded the hip-hop impresario has a \u201cbad temper\u201d and is prone to violent outbursts that are often fueled by alcohol, jealousy and drugs.",
      "But she maintained that while his actions might have warranted domestic violence charges, they aren\u2019t proof he engaged in sex trafficking and racketeering \u2014 the charges he faces.",
      "Geragos argued that Combs\u2019 sexual habits were part of a swinger lifestyle involving consenting adults and reminded jurors that \u201ckinky\u201d sexual predilections don\u2019t equate to sex trafficking.",
      "\u201cSean Combs is a complicated man. But this is not a complicated case,\" she said. \u201cThis case is about love, jealousy, infidelity and money.\u201d",
      "The packed courtroom fell silent when jurors were shown security camera video of Combs assaulting Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.",
      "The video depicts Cassie, an R&B singer, headed down a hallway toward the hotel\u2019s elevators just before Combs rounds a corner, strikes her and throws her to the ground before kicking her and then dragging her back toward their hotel room.",
      "Jurors also viewed photographs of damage in the hotel hallway, including flowers strewn on the floor and soil spattered against a wall. Later, as Cassie testified about the attack, they were shown photos of the musician\u2019s swollen lip.",
      "The trial\u2019s first witness was a former security guard at the hotel. Israel Florez testified Combs attempted to bribe him, holding out a stack of money with a $100 on top, telling him: \u201cDon\u2019t tell nobody.\u201d",
      "Florez said he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t want your money. Just go back into your room.\u201d",
      "The \u201cMe & U\u201d singer, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, testified that Combs was into voyeurism and dictated every aspect of sex events he dubbed \u201cfreak-offs.\u201d",
      "The highly orchestrated affairs, which Combs also called \u201cwild king nights\u201d or \u201chotel nights,\" involved male sex workers, heavy drug use and copious lubrication.",
      "\u201cIt was his fantasy,\u201d Cassie said.",
      "Cassie said each \u201cfreak-off\u201d involved about 10 large bottles of baby oil -- heated up.",
      "\u201cIt was such a mess,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said Combs also asked her to perform degrading and painful sex acts with male sex workers.",
      "Cassie said eventually she was doing \u201cfreak-offs\u201d weekly for a decade, with the final one in 2017 or 2018.",
      "\u201cThe freak-offs became a job,\u201d Cassie recounted.",
      "She said she felt she couldn't refuse because she feared the videos would be made public.",
      "Jurors also heard from Daniel Phillip, who said he was a professional stripper paid to have sex with Cassie while Combs gave instructions. He testified that he once saw Combs drag Cassie by her hair as she screamed.",
      "Defense lawyers, during their cross examination of Cassie, sought to cast the musician as an enthusiastic participant in the sex marathons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always ready to freak off,\u201d she wrote in one 2009 message read in court.",
      "Later that year, however, Cassie expressed frustration with the state of their relationship and told Combs she needed something more from him than sex.",
      "In a 2017 text message, Cassie told Combs: \u201cI love our FOs when we both want it,\u201d using the initials of freak-off. On the stand, Cassie explained: \u201cI would say loving FOs were just words at that point.\u201d",
      "The former cast member on Combs\u2019 MTV reality show \u201cMaking the Band\" testified that she saw Combs physically attack Cassie on multiple occasions.",
      "During a 2009 incident in his home, Richard said Combs tried to strike Cassie in the head with a black skillet before he put his arm around her neck and dragged her up the stairs.",
      "\u201cI was scared for her and scared to do anything,\" she said. \u201cI had never seen anything like that before.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In 1971, Oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a \u201cbottle bill.\"",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Monica Truax has lived in her Portland home since 1992, on a cul-de-sac she described as a close-knit community. But since a bottle redemption center opened next door several years ago, her block has struggled with drug dealing, garbage and fights in the middle of the night, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's just all completely changed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the people are all still here, you know, all the residents are here still, and still raising their families.\u201d",
      "After more than five decades, Oregon's first-in-the-nation \u201cbottle bill\u201d \u2014 now replicated in nine other states \u2014 faces a potential overhaul, with lawmakers considering new time restrictions on bottle redemption sites that some say have become magnets for drugs and homelessness.",
      "The trailblazing law to reduce littering by incentivizing recycling helped cement the state's reputation as a leader in the emerging environmental movement. It has also become a financial security net for many, including those experiencing homelessness.",
      "The legislation echoes calls to modernize the bottle bill, with some saying changes are needed to address unintended consequences.",
      "\u201cHe did not envision this,\u201d Truax said of former Oregon Gov. Tom McCall, who signed the bottle bill into law. \u201cIt\u2019s just a mess.\u201d",
      "Consumers originally paid a 5-cent deposit on each eligible bottle or can, then collected the deposit when they redeemed the empty container at a retailer, such as a supermarket or convenience store.",
      "Over the years, the program has expanded accepted containers and increased the deposit to 10 cents. Twenty-seven centers exclusively for returns have been opened across the state.",
      "California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Vermont and the U.S. territory of Guam followed Oregon in adopting the concept, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "In Oregon, people can sign up for accounts in which their refunds are deposited or choose cash redemptions. Some stores count containers by hand. Other sites have counting machines or areas where account holders can drop off bags of containers.",
      "The deposit has not kept pace with inflation \u2014 5 cents in 1971 would be equal to 40 cents today, according to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s inflation calculator \u2014 but many low-income residents rely on it.",
      "Stores must accept container returns when they are open, and owners of all-night convenience stores, particularly in Portland, say they're concerned about employee safety.",
      "In an op-ed for The Oregonian/OregonLive last year, Jonathan Polonsky, president and CEO of the Plaid Pantry chain of convenience stores, wrote that fentanyl was selling for less than $1 a pill and \u201ca small number of cans add up to enough to buy drugs.\u201d",
      "People redeeming containers at night \"may be belligerent and intimidating, presenting a major safety risk to our store associates who have no choice under Oregon\u2019s Bottle Bill to handle returns at that hour,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Truax, who lives with her husband in northeast Portland, said homeless encampments and people relieving themselves in public were among the many things she had witnessed on her block.",
      "\u201cI've seen it all,\u201d she said, describing the scourge of fentanyl as \u201cthe cherry on the sundae.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just sad,\" she added.",
      "At the bottle redemption center near Truax's home, Chris Grass waited with his father and girlfriend in the long line outside the door. They each redeemed the maximum amount of 350 containers per person per day for $105 in cash to help pay for gas and provide some extra money for things like cigarettes and coffee while he's unemployed, he said.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don't like people that go out and can,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it's actually good for the environment.\"",
      "In 2023, roughly 87% of eligible containers were returned for redemption, according to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission. That was the highest rate in the nation that year, according to the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, which operates the bottle bill program on behalf of its distributor members.",
      "The bill being considered by lawmakers would allow stores across the state to refuse container returns after 8 p.m.",
      "In Portland, it would allow for \u201calternative\u201d redemption sites, including possible mobile sites such as trucks that travel to different neighborhoods. Nonprofits would run the alternative sites for people who redeem containers every day, relieving the pressure on retailers, particularly downtown.",
      "Stores in an area with an alternative drop site could limit or refuse hand-counted returns, with convenience stores specifically allowed to stop them at 6 p.m.",
      "The proposal is supported by retailers as well as groups like the Ground Score Association, whose members include \u201ccanners\u201d and waste pickers who collect containers for income. The association operates a Portland redemption center under a bridge called The People's Depot that processes some 38,000 containers daily, according to its website.",
      "It has pushed back against claims that the bottle bill fuels the fentanyl crisis and says most people redeeming bottles need the money to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cSince becoming manager of The People's Depot, I'm learning how polarizing The Oregon Bottle Bill is,\u201d the depot's operational manager Kristofer Brown said in written testimony supporting the bill.",
      "Unlike in some other states, Oregon\u2019s bottle bill program is run by the private beverage industry rather than state government. The Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative retains unredeemed deposits, which topped $30 million in 2019, according to a 2020 state audit of the bottle bill.",
      "The audit recommended several changes, including having some or all unredeemed deposits go to the state to help fund environmental programs.",
      "Consolidated Oregon Indivisible Network, a progressive advocacy group, said in written testimony supporting the bill that \u201cmoney is piling up in the bottle deposit fund\u201d and called for another government audit.",
      "The OBRC says unredeemed refunds go toward operating expenses for the beverage container redemption system.",
      "The Legislature has until late June to approve the bill, which received overwhelming approval in the Senate and is now in the House.",

      "House Republicans are in the final rounds of negotiations over a sweeping budget plan that has been significantly influenced by President Donald Trump's priorities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Days before Republicans unveiled their sweeping tax cut plan, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee had one last person to consult. He went to the White House, where he and President Donald Trump went over the legislation \u201cline by line.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very happy with what we\u2019re delivering,\u201d said Rep. Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri.",
      "Trump had every reason to be pleased. His imprint is all over on the bill making its way through the House, starting with its title \u2014 the \u201c One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\u201d",
      "The legislation realizes many of Trump's campaign promises, temporarily ending taxes on overtime and tips for many workers, creating a new $10,000 tax break on auto loan interest for American-made cars, and even creating a new tax-free \u201cMAGA account\u201d \u2014 a nod to his \u201dMake America Great Again\" movement, but in this case, it means \u201cMoney Accounts for Growth and Advancement.\u201d This would contribute $1,000 to children born in his second term.",
      "The Trump-inspired contours of the legislative package, months if not years in the making, reflect not only the president's considerable influence over the Republican Party, but also the hard political realities in the House, where Republicans have only the barest of majorities and often find it difficult to find consensus without Trump's involvement.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., effectively owes his job to Trump and has kept in constant contact with him during the negotiations, including during his overseas trip this week.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s excited about our forward progress,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou know, I keep him apprised of the developments, and he\u2019s had a busy time over there in the Middle East, and it\u2019s been good \u2014 he\u2019s in good spirits and we\u2019re in good spirits.\u201d",
      "The Republican bill runs a whopping 1,116 pages and includes more than $5 trillion in tax cuts, costs that are partially offset by spending cuts elsewhere and other changes in the tax code. The legislation would make permanent the tax cuts from Trump's first term while reducing funding for programs involving food assistance, college financing and environmental protection.",
      "As talks over the bill have progressed, divisions have emerged among Republicans, particularly between fiscal hawks most concerned about federal deficits and others more focused on the impact of cuts back home.",
      "That's where Trump usually comes in, playing the \u201ccloser\u201d who turns no votes to yes.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has gone out of his way to ask us: \u2018Are there any members you want me to call? Anybody that you want me to talk to?\u2019 And he calls them right then,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. \"He\u2019s been incredibly hands-on and incredibly helpful at getting the bill to where it is.\u201d",
      "Trump's involvement seems certain to grow as Johnson labors to get the tax package through the House by a self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Conservatives slowed the process Friday, refusing to advance the tax package out of the House Budget Committee until it includes faster implementation of Medicaid changes and a more wholesale repeal of Biden-era green energy credits. They vowed to hold firm until their demands are met.",
      "Trump took notice, applying pressure even before the gavel went down on the failed committee vote.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t need \u2018GRANDSTANDERS\u2019 in the Republican Party,\" Trump wrote on social media. \"STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!\u201d",
      "Negotiations were expected to stretch through the weekend, with the Budget Committee reconvening late Sunday night in hopes of a breakthrough.",
      "Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, predicted the tax package will ultimately get over the finish line once Trump \u2014 just returning from a tour of the Middle East \u2014 starts making calls to skeptical lawmakers.",
      "\u201cYou may have noticed he likes talking on the telephone,\u201d Rogers said.",
      "Added Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, \u201cI think the only way we\u2019re going to get on track with it is with Trump.\u201d",
      "The close coordination with Republican leaders stands in stark contrast to Trump's first term, when the party first enacted a slew of personal and corporate tax breaks. Republicans quickly cobbled that tax package together in late 2017 after a disastrous attempt at fulfilling their central campaign promise -- repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "This time, White House aides have been in regular contact with GOP lawmakers as the tax bill progresses through drafts and markups, highlighting programs they aim to overhaul and provisions they\u2019d like to add or cut.",
      "The president \u201cis much more engaged in directing what happens than the first time because he and the leadership of Congress in 2017 were not seeing eye-to-eye,\" Scalise said. \"He didn\u2019t necessarily want health care to be the first thing that was done, and yet it was. This time around we talked a lot before he was sworn in to make sure we were all on the same page.\u201d",
      "Trump first began to set the course of the GOP's current legislative strategy back in January, when he posted to social media that Republicans should pass \u201cone powerful bill\u201d that would tackle all of the party\u2019s priorities instead of splitting the agenda into two packages.",
      "Senate Republicans argued for a different approach. They urged quick passage of a bill to provide billions for the Pentagon and Trump's immigration clampdown, saying a second tax package could wait until later.",
      "Trump wavered for a time, giving Republicans on Capitol Hill mixed signals over the best approach. But his original preference for one bill won out in the end, in part because House Republicans insisted their chamber could not do it any other way.",
      "Democrats uniformly oppose the package but have little power to stop it from becoming law if Republicans remain unified. As they continue to grapple with the party's losses in last year's election, Democrats have worked to mobilize public opposition to the bill, decrying it as a giveaway to the rich paid for with cuts to healthcare and other social services.",
      "Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called it \u201cone big, beautiful betrayal.\u201d",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to press ahead and get the tax package to the Senate, with hopes of getting it on Trump's desk by the Fourth of July.",
      "Burchett said that while \u201ceverybody rises up in righteous indignation\u201d over the details, Republicans will start \u201ccoming to the table\u201d once Trump is fully engaged.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an NBA basketball game right now,\" Burchett said. \"Don\u2019t watch the game. Just wait till the last two minutes and then turn on the TV.\u201d",

      "A decade ago, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was a volunteer organizer for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign",
      "Among Democrats on Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wields far more power than New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But the progressive champions have the hearts of Democratic voters across the country.",
      "About three-quarters of Democrats have a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d favorable view of Sanders, while about half have a favorable view of Ocasio-Cortez, according to a recent survey from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Compare them with Schumer, an establishment Democrat, who is viewed favorably by only about a third of Democrats.",
      "Nearly the entire difference in favorability ratings between Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez can be explained by voters who said they don\u2019t know enough to form an opinion of AOC. Their unfavorable ratings among Democrats were essentially the same, around 15% for both.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez, now 35, was an anonymous Sanders campaign volunteer a decade ago. Now she\u2019s perhaps the best positioned to be the 83-year-old Sanders\u2019 successor atop his progressive movement as the Democratic Partytries to position itself in Trump\u2019s America.",
      "But that role comes with risks \u2014 President Donald Trump and Republicans have long made AOC a foil, and some Democrats, progressive and moderate alike, have argued she and Sanders are too disruptive and push for unrealistic policy ideas.",
      "Sanders and AOC have long portrayed their political relationship as familial. She used to call him \u201cTio Bernie,\u201d Spanish for \u201cUncle Bernie.\u201d He recently held her hand onstage in front of a huge crowd and said, tongue in cheek, \u201cI want to say a word about my daughter.\u201d",

      "\u201cIn many ways, the congresswoman represents what Bernie has been advocating for decades: When working-class people in this country stand up against the entrenched political elite and fight to fix an economic system propelled by uncontrollable greed, they will win,\u201d Bahr said.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez returned home to the Bronx after graduating from Boston University in 2011. She was a volunteer organizer for Sanders' 2016 campaign, his first presidential run and one that built a national movement around his vision of democratic socialism, even as he lost to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "When she decided to run for office herself, AOC had virtually no money but was assisted by progressive organizations, among them Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats, with ties to veterans of Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign.",
      "Sanders was quick to congratulate his virtually unknown prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in June 2018 after she defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, a member of the Democratic leadership and potential future speaker, in the primary.",
      "A month later, they campaigned together in Kansas for two progressive House candidates and sat for a joint interview on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust two years ago, we were both in St. Mary\u2019s Park in the South Bronx. I was in the crowd with thousands of other people across ages, races, creeds, incomes. And to be here two years later pushing that revolution in Kansas is pretty amazing,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said during their joint Kansas appearance.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez began her congressional career in 2019 by introducing the Green New Deal. The ambitious proposal called for transforming the U.S. economy by eliminating fossil fuels while creating national health care coverage and job guarantees, as well as high-quality education and affordable housing. It has been criticized by Republicans and many Democrats for its cost and the potential disruption that would be caused by a restructuring of the economy.",
      "It was only a nonbinding resolution, but the Green New Deal became a major issue in the 2020 Democratic primary and a lightning rod for criticism on the right, further cementing Ocasio-Cortez as a power player in Democratic politics.",
      "By late 2019, Sanders was struggling in his second White House campaign. Much of the Democratic field \u2014 notably Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 had co-opted pieces of his agenda and split the progressive coalition.",
      "Then, Sanders suffered an untimely heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas. He needed a boost, and it came from Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "She bestowed her endorsement during a rally at a park in her congressional district. She later campaigned with him in the crucial early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and she seconded his nomination at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "As the Sanders presidential campaign floundered, Ocasio-Cortez was conflicted about whether to endorse him, according to a book published years later. Just months into her first term in Congress and already one of the best-known members of the House, she was still uncomfortable speaking to crowds and still feeling out how to build and wield her influence, aides told the authors of \u201cThe Truce: Progressives, Centrists, and the Future of the Democratic Party.\" The book was published last year and excerpted in Vanity Fair magazine.",
      "Corbin Trent, her first communications director in the House, threatened to quit when Ocasio-Cortez floated delaying the rally, according to the book. He told the authors he remembered a \u201cbig argument\" about the episode. Even as she campaigned for Sanders, she worried she'd be outshined and her star power would evaporate as quickly as it arrived.",
      "After Sanders lost the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, they continued occasional joint appearances, campaigning for progressive candidates or discussing topics such as the early response to COVID-19, union activism and climate change. As the 2024 election approached, they campaigned together for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee who replaced Biden after his debate performance.",
      "Trump's return to the White House left Democrats dejected and searching for a way forward. Sanders answered with a series of rallies he called his \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour, an attempt to push the rebuilding party to lead the working class in existential struggle against wealthy elites.",
      "After a few solo rallies, he invited AOC to come along.",
      "She introduced him, as she had years prior, as the inspiration for her own political career. But she added more depth.",
      "\u201cI know that one of the things that inspired me to run for office for the first time is that when I saw Sen. Sanders on television, and I was wiping tables down and saw the TV on and saying, every person in this country deserves health care as a human right,\" she told a crowd in Tempe, Arizona, in March. \"And I know it made me feel almost for the first time that this isn\u2019t something that we should earn. This is something that should be afforded to all of us because we are human. I just want to thank him, and so let\u2019s give him the most earthshaking round of applause.\u201d",
      "Sanders has resisted talking publicly of naming a successor while noting that he will not run for president again in 2028, when he turns 87. But holding her hand in Salt Lake City last month, he told a roaring crowd that he considered AOC to be family.",
      "\u201cNow I want to say a word about my daughter. I want to say a word about Alexandria and why what she\u2019s doing is so important,\" he said. \"Six years ago, what were you doing for a living? She was a waitress. But she looked around her and she saw a society that was fundamentally unjust and in many ways ugly to the people in the community in which she lived in New York City. She stood up and took on one of the most powerful people in the House of Representatives.\u201d",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has announced he will veto a measure to create a commission to study potential slavery reparations in the state",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced Friday he will veto a measure to create a commission to study potential slavery reparations in the state, saying that while it was a difficult decision, the issue already has been studied and now is the time \u201cto focus on the work itself.\u201d",
      "Moore, a Democrat who is the state's first Black governor and the only Black governor currently serving, wrote in his veto letter that he applauded the legislature's work on the bill.",
      "\u201cBut in light of the many important studies that have taken place on this issue over nearly three decades, now is the time to focus on the work itself: Narrowing the racial wealth gap, expanding homeownership, uplifting entrepreneurs of color, and closing the foundational disparities that lead to inequality \u2014 from food insecurity to education,\u201d Moore wrote.",
      "The governor also noted in his veto letter that Black politicians have risen to the highest levels of government in the state in recent years. For example, U.S. Senator Angela Alsobrooks is the state's first Black U.S. senator. Maryland also has a Black attorney general, a Black state House speaker and a Black treasurer.",
      "\u201cWe have moved in partnership with leaders across the state to uplift Black families and address racial disparities in our communities,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cThat is the context in which I\u2019ve made this difficult decision. Because while I appreciate the work that went into this legislation, I strongly believe now is not the time for another study. Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve.\u201d",
      "The bill was introduced in this year's legislative session as a top priority of the Legislative Black Caucus, which, with 66 members, is the largest Black caucus in the nation's state legislatures.",
      "The caucus released a statement Friday night expressing deep disappointment in the governor's veto.",
      "\u201cAt a time when the White House and Congress are actively targeting Black communities, dismantling diversity initiatives, and using harmful coded language, Governor Moore had a chance to show the country and the world that here in Maryland we boldly and courageously recognize our painful history and the urgent need to address it,\" the caucus said in the statement. \u201cInstead, the State\u2019s first Black governor chose to block this historic legislation that would have moved the state toward directly repairing the harm of enslavement.\u201d",
      "The measure passed with strong support in the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats. The House voted 101-36 for the bill, and the Senate approved it 32-13. Both chambers approved the measure with margins large enough to override a veto, if all members who voted for the bill decided to vote to override the governor's veto.",
      "The legislature ended its regular 90-day session last month, and it would not take up veto overrides until lawmakers gather again, whether next year's regularly scheduled 90-day session in January, or a special session this year, if one were to be called.",
      "The governor's veto was one among 23 announced by the governor late Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cThe Senate will closely evaluate each veto from the Governor's Office and have more details on possible action in the near future,\" said David Schuhlein, a spokesman for Senate President Bill Ferguson.",
      "House Speaker Adrienne Jones issued a statement specifically on the governor's veto of creating the commission, saying \u201cI am proud of all our work during the 2025 session and grateful to lead a state that has always put these issues at the forefront of our policy discussions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe work is not done, and I remain committed to working alongside all our partners to continue righting historical inequities,\u201d the speaker, a Democrat, added.",
      "Potential reparations outlined in the bill included official statements of apology, monetary compensation, property tax rebates, social service assistance, as well as licensing and permit fee waivers and reimbursement. Reparations also could include assistance with making a down payment on a home, business incentives, childcare, debt forgiveness and tuition payment waivers for higher education.",
      "The governor wrote in his veto letter that over the last 25 years, Maryland has launched several commissions and study groups to examine the legacy of slavery in the state, from the Maryland Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission to the State Commission to Coordinate the Study, Commemoration, and Impact of the History and Legacy of Slavery in Maryland.",
      "\u201cThe scholarship on this topic is both vast in scope and robust in scale,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cAnd we are grateful for the Marylanders who have contributed their expertise to the vital project of understanding how the legacy of slavery continues to impact Black communities in our state today.\u201d",
      "Last year, California lawmakers passed some of the nation\u2019s most ambitious legislation aimed at atoning for a legacy of racist policies that drove racial disparities for Black people. None of the bills provided widespread direct payments to Black Americans. Instead, California lawmakers approved the return of land or compensation to families whose property was unjustly seized by the government, and issuing a formal apology.",
      "New York City lawmakers approved legislation last year to study the city\u2019s significant role in slavery and consider reparations to descendants of enslaved people.",

      "Slaton described being caught in an avalanche at one point, causing her to fall and hurt her leg. She didn\u2019t say which day that happened. She had a bicycle, a tent, two sleeping bags and food, she said, but she ended up losing all of her equipment, leaving her with only a lighter, a knife and some snacks. She didn\u2019t describe how she lost her tent or other gear.",

      "\u201cI would have never anticipated her in my wildest dreams being able to get back as far as she did,\u201d Sheriff John Zanoni said.",
      "Slaton had been on an extended biking and backpacking trip that also included time in Oregon, department spokesman Tony Botti said. Her journey took her to the Sierras, where she decided to make the trek to the Mono Hot Springs before meeting a friend in mid-April, he said. She was last seen on April 20 by a security camera near Huntington Lake, an unincorporated mountain community, riding on a bicycle and also sitting on a sidewalk with a backpack.",
      "Slaton\u2019s parents, who live in Georgia, reported her missing on April 29 after they hadn't heard from her in a week.",

      "The owner of Vermilion Valley Resort, Christopher Gutierrez, said his staff left cabin doors unlocked during the winter in case someone needed shelter during the frequent mountain snowstorms. His backcountry lodge sits in the Sierra Nevada about halfway between Yosemite and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks and is a frequent stop for hikers on the John Muir and Pacific Crest trails.",
      "Slaton found safe haven in one of those cabins during an intense snowstorm where all she could see was white, she said. It was just eight hours later that Gutierrez arrived to open the cabin for the season, authorities said.",

The cartel was recently designated a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "An indictment alleging the crimes by Maria Del Rosario Navarro Sanchez, a 39-year-old Mexican, was unsealed Friday in the Western district of Texas. It was not immediately clear if Navarro Sanchez had a lawyer.",

      "The Trump administration argues that the international connections and operations of the groups \u2014 including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory \u2014 warrant the designation.",

      "Inside a basement classroom in Santa Monica on Wednesday, Smith and Samuel O\u2019Neal, The Temple News\u2019 editor-in-chief, handed out the papers to the high school staff.",
      "It was the first time they had seen their Tideline articles in print, as the paper had moved online years ago due to the cost.",
      "Kate Swain, 18, a co-editor-in-chief for the paper, said it felt surreal to finally flip through the printed pages.",
      "\u201cBecause of everything that we\u2019ve gone through together, everything that we\u2019ve had to persevere through and everyone\u2019s had all these personal things that they\u2019ve been dealing with,\" she said. \"And yet simultaneously, we\u2019ve been pouring all this time and energy and all of our passion for journalism into writing these articles.\u201d",
      "Gigi Appelbaum, 18, a co-editor-in-chief of the paper who lost her home in the fire, said the project felt especially distinct because it involved people thousands of miles away.",
      "\u201cThe fact that people from across the country are aware of what's going on with us and emphasize with our situation and want to get our voices out there, it\u2019s really special,\u201d said Appelbaum, who has been on the paper for four years.",
      "One of the things she lost in the fire was a box filled with important cards and messages. She said she plans to store her copy in a new box as she works to restart the collection.",
      "Smith and Nehus Saxon met in 1983 during a game between the Angels and Yankees in Anaheim, California. Nehus Saxon said she walked over to Smith to introduce herself and found her hustling to meet a deadline.",
      "\u201cWho knew that little introduction would blossom into this,\u201d said Nehus Saxon.",
      "In the years since, they\u2019ve traveled to London together for Major League Baseball\u2019s first games in Europe, and they cried together in 2017 as Smith became the first woman to win the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America\u2019s Career Excellence Award.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t talk every week,\u201d Nehus Saxon said. \u201cSometimes we can go, you know, months and months without talking. But all we have to do is send each other a text message and we know the other will be there immediately.\u201d",
      "That bond was made all the more clear when Nehus Saxon heard from Smith as fire engulfed her community. Her home was only three blocks from the school. While it survived the blaze, it\u2019s filled with led laden ash and may not be safe to live in for years.",
      "But with the help of Smith, she and her students have been able to move forward and produce the final edition of the school year. After the papers were handed out, Nehus Saxon kept one for the school's archive.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019ve lost everything you\u2019ve got to start somewhere,\u201d Smith said.",

      "A Wisconsin angler fishing in the fog this week discovered the wreck of an abandoned tugboat in Lake Michigan",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A Wisconsin angler fishing in the fog this week discovered the wreck of an abandoned tugboat submerged in the waters of Lake Michigan for more than a century, state officials announced Friday.",
      "Wisconsin Historical Society Maritime Archaeologist Tamara Thomsen said that the society confirmed that Christopher Thuss found the wreck of the J.C. Ames. Thuss was fishing in Lake Michigan off the city of Manitowoc in foggy conditions on Tuesday when he noticed the wreckage in nine feet of water off a breakwater, she said in a message to The Associated Press.",
      "The society said that according to the book \u201cGreen Bay Workhorses: The Nau Tug Line,\u201d the Rand and Burger shipbuilding company in Manitowoc built the J.C. Ames in 1881 to help move lumber. The tug was one of the largest and most powerful on the Great Lakes, with a 670-horsepower engine.",
      "The tug served multiple purposes beyond moving lumber, including transporting railway cars. It eventually fell into disrepair and was scuttled in 1923, as was the practice then when ships outlived their usefulness, Thomsen said.",
      "The ship had been buried in the sand at the bottom of the lake for decades before storms this winter apparently revealed it, Thomsen said. A lack of quagga mussels attached to the ship indicates it was only recently exposed, she said.",
      "Historians are racing to locate shipwrecks and downed planes in the Great Lakes before quagga mussels destroy them. Quagga have become the dominant invasive species in the lower lakes over the last 30 years, attaching themselves to wooden shipwrecks and sunken aircraft in layers so thick they eventually crush the wreckage.",
      "\u201cThese kinds of discoveries are always so exciting because it allows a piece of lost history to resurface. It sat there for over a hundred years and then came back on our radar completely by chance,\u201d Thomsen said in a statement. \u201cWe are grateful that Chris Thuss noticed the wreck and reported it so we can share this story with the Wisconsin communities that this history belongs to.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The board that oversees California\u2019s toxic substances agency unanimously voted Thursday to remove a controversial proposal that would have weakened a state hazardous waste disposal rule",
      "CYPRESS, Calif. -- California shouldn't weaken hazardous waste rules to allow local landfills to accept toxic dirt that currently goes to two specialized disposal sites in the Central Valley and hazardous facilities in other states, the state Board of Environmental Safety voted Thursday.",
      "The vote went against a proposal by the Department of Toxic Substances Control that had prompted fierce opposition from environmental groups.",
      "\u201cI think they have been really listening to the community,\" said Melissa Bumstead with the advocacy group Parents Against the Santa Susana Field Lab.",
      "California's hazardous waste laws are stricter than the federal government's, and the state has long transported much of the waste it considers hazardous to other states with more lenient rules.",
      "The Department of Toxic Substances Control said disposing more waste in state would likely reduce costs and truck emissions. But environmental advocates worried the plan could have exposed already vulnerable communities to contaminated waste and set the precedent for more rules to be weakened.",
      "\u201cI don't think that municipal waste landfills were ever designed to accept this kind of waste, and to deregulate it ... puts those landfill communities\u201d at risk, said Jane Williams, executive director of California Communities Against Toxics.",
      "California only has two hazardous waste landfills \u2014 Buttonwillow and Kettleman Hills in the San Joaquin Valley \u2014 which are expected to reach capacity by 2039, according to a report by the department. An estimated 47% of California\u2019s hazardous waste is trucked across state borders. Contaminated soil, waste oil and mixed oil are the state\u2019s three largest annual sources of hazardous waste. On average, more than 567,000 tons (514,373 metric tons) of toxic soil are produced every year.",
      "The hearing comes months after wildfires in Los Angeles incinerated cars, homes and everything in them, turning ordinary objects into hundreds of tons of hazardous waste requiring specialized cleanup. It was the largest wild\ufb01re hazardous materials cleanup in the EPA\u2019s history.",
      "The infernos have also raised concerns about toxic ash and soil. Just this week, the Pasadena Unified School District published soil testing results showing high levels of arsenic or brain-damaging lead in nearly half its schools.",
      "After the fires, hazardous waste was sent to temporary sites to be separated and packaged before most of it was trucked to Utah, Arizona, Nebraska and Arkansas. Two facilities were in California \u2014 in Wilmington, near the port of Long Beach, and Buttonwillow. The type and amount of waste deposited in them varies by site, but it includes oil, radioactive materials, paint residue, asbestos, controlled substances and fluorescent lamps.",
      "\u201cI think that the fires have really brought to the fore some long-standing issues,\u201d said Angela Johnson Meszaros with the environmental law group Earthjustice. \u201cAnd one of them is, how are we going to deal with cleanup, right? Because fires are not the only thing that cause soil to be hazardous.\u201d",
      "A state law passed in 2021 set out to reform the Department of Toxic Substances Control. In March, the department released a draft plan of sweeping proposals that would guide state and local hazardous management. The board is expected to make a final decision in the summer, and it's not clear if the department could go against the board's wishes not to weaken the hazardous waste disposal rule.",
      "Board member Alexis Strauss Hacker recalled how concerned people were about the proposal during their March meeting in Fresno. The fear, she said, was \u201cso palpable.\u201d",
      "Although California has decreased its hazardous waste by more than 40% since 2000, lithium-ion batteries and other types of waste are expected to increase, the report says, and the state currently lacks the capacity to manage them. Lithium-ion batteries are found in common items such as electronic vehicles, cellphones and laptops.",
      "Decades of industrial environmental pollution can accumulate, too.",
      "Bumstead has lived near the heavily polluted Santa Susana Field Laboratory in Southern California, once a site for rocket testing and nuclear reactor development.",
      "Her 15-year-old daughter is a two-time cancer survivor, and Bumstead was born with three spleens. She believes her family\u2019s health issues are linked to pollution from the nearby site. So when she heard that California environmental regulators wanted to weaken hazardous waste disposal rules in a bid to dump toxic soil into local landfills, she was very concerned.",
      "The Los Angeles fires have made more people realize that toxic materials could end up in their backyard, Bumstead said.",
      "\u201cThe more we see climate change, the more we see wildfires, the more this is going to become a front line issue,\u201d she told the board. \u201cThis is an opportunity not just for hazardous waste that is manufactured, but also hazardous waste that is created by wildfires on how to create a plan that is going to protect Californians in the future.\u201d",

      "The addition of 20,000 National Guard troops would provide a huge boost to immigration enforcement. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the DHS agency responsible for immigration enforcement in the interior of the country, has a total staff of about 20,000 people spread across three divisions.",
      "Enforcement and Removals Operations, which is the division directly responsible for arresting and removing people who do not have the right to stay in the country, has a total staff of roughly 7,700 people, including a little over 6,000 law enforcement officers.",

      "So far, these troops have largely been limited to providing airlift, bolstering the wall, surveillance and administrative support to free up border agents for arrests or detentions.",
      "Along the newly militarized zone, troops have put up warning signs and accompanied border agents but left the detention of migrants crossing the border to other agencies.",
      "In New Mexico, where the new militarized zone was first created, federal magistrate judges have started dismissing national security charges against migrants accused of crossing the southern U.S. border through the newly designated military zone, finding little evidence that they were aware of the zone.",

The growth has come so quickly that the city \u2014 which more than doubled its population since 2020 \u2014 has struggled to build roads and infrastructure fast enough as it transforms from a farming community.",

Princeton now has several stoplights and a Walmart, he said, but has had to implement a temporary moratorium on new home construction so infrastructure can keep pace.",
      "Cities of all sizes grew on average from 2023 to 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's Vintage 2024 estimates, with New York City, Houston and Los Angeles seeing the greatest numeric gains and some cities in the Northeast and Midwest marking their first population increase in recent years.",

      "The tanks are a key part of a parade that will honor the Army's 250th birthday and fall on President Donald Trump's 79th birthday. Since it was announced, the parade has grown in scope and participation, and one of the highlights will be columns of tanks rolling in formation along Constitution Avenue. Each Abrams tank can weigh 60 tons or more and carry a crew of four.",

The metal plates are seen as the best way to protect the streets Each plate weighs hundreds of pounds and will be placed at points along the parade route where the tanks will turn \u2014 and where their metal and rubber-shoed tracking that helps them move can do the most damage, the official said.",

      "\u201cAs the leader, I am championing resources. I am moving mountains if they get in your way,\u201d Johnson told the board during her job interview. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the best academian at this point in my career.\u201d",
      "The appointment of Johnson came at the end of a contentious and at times emotional process that critics argued lacked transparency and was tainted by political influence. One member of FAMU's board resigned after suggesting the school suspend the search to address community concerns.",
      "Johnson's supporters said that though she's not an academic leader, she's prepared to navigate the changing landscape of higher education, at a time when public universities are increasingly dependent on the political priorities of state lawmakers.",
      "\u201cWe have to survive in Florida,\u201d said Jamal Brown, president of the Faculty Senate and a member of the board. \u201cThis moment calls for someone who understands the systems that fund and govern us, because right now our survival depends on how we navigate those systems.\u201d",
      "Johnson's selection came over the fierce opposition of some of the school\u2019s staunchest supporters, who celebrate FAMU\u2019s legacy of Black excellence, social mobility and cultural pride.",
      "\u201cThere was a lack of intellectual depth and a gap in cultural connection that was just painfully blatant,\u201d Board Chair Kirstin Harper said of Johnson.",
      "\u201cIn an age of merit-based hiring decisions, how can one justify settling for a candidate who does not meet all of the position criteria? Or turning a blind eye to exceptionally qualified candidates?\u201d Harper added.",
      "The board chose Johnson from a field of four finalists, which included FAMU's chief operating officer Donald Palm, who was the clear favorite among an outspoken contingent of the university's students and supporters, and who was endorsed by the school's influential alumni association.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have your own students, faculty, and alumni behind you, no matter what relationships you have, that\u2019s a recipe for disaster,\" film producer and alum Will Packer told the board ahead of the vote. \"Do not set Marva Johnson up to fail. Do not put her in a position to take over a house severely divided.\u201d",
      "Johnson's nomination comes at a time when public universities are grappling with mounting threats to their state and federal funding, and as the officials overseeing Florida's public universities \u2014 many of whom were appointed by DeSantis \u2014 are increasingly turning to former Republican state lawmakers to lead the schools.",
      "Board member Belvin Perry said while he discussed the search with the governor's staff, he didn't feel any political pressure to pick a certain candidate. Perry ultimately cast his vote for Palm, though he felt Johnson's selection was inevitable.",
      "\u201cIt is a foregone conclusion as to result of this vote today,\" Perry said. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d",

      "The plaintiffs ask the court to \"stop this imminent threat to our nation\u2019s historic and critical support of the humanities by restoring funding appropriated by Congress.\" It notes the \u201cdisruption and attempted destruction, spearheaded by DOGE,\u201d of a partnership between the state and the federal government to support the humanities.",

      "The humanities groups' lawsuit said DOGE brought the core work of the humanities councils \u201cto a screeching halt\" this spring when it terminated its grant program.",
      "The filing is the most recent lawsuit filed by humanities groups and historical, research and library associations to try to stop funding cuts and the dissolution of federal agencies and organizations.",

      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",

      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",

      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "Regulator Ofwat has been able to stop firms using customer money to fund bonuses, but the new rules mean they could not use funds from shareholders or lenders either.",

      "It could mean that water companies' bonuses could be blocked as soon as next month.",
      "The ban would also be retrospective, meaning bonuses paid in the last financial year could be clawed back.",
      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said customers \"should not pay the price for water company mismanagement\" and that it was \"demanding an improvement in performance\".",
      "It said firms would be judged each year on four measures - environmental performance, consumer matters, financial resilience and criminal liability.",
      "Bonuses would be \"prohibited if [the water companies] fail to meet acceptable standards\".",
      "'Competitive marketplace'",
      "\"The government will ban the payment of unfair bonuses for polluting water bosses,\" Reed said. \"The days of profiting from failure are over.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Thames chairman Sir Adrian Montague told MPs: \"We live in a competitive marketplace and we have to provide the right sort of packages to these people otherwise the head hunters come knocking.\"",
      "In a statement, a Thames spokesperson said the company was involved in a \"complex turnaround and restructuring process\" to \"deliver better results for our customers and the environment and seek a long-term solution to our financial resilience\".",
      "\"It is critical that the business retains the people best placed to deliver the improved outcomes our stakeholders rightly expect.\"",
      "Thames said the upcoming payments were not performance-related bonuses covered by the new rules, but instead \"retention payments\".",
      "It said none of these retention payments would be funded by customers.",
      "Last November, Ofwat blocked three water firms - including Thames, Yorkshire Water and Dwr Cymru Welsh Water - from using customer money to fund a total of \u00a31.6m in bosses' bonuses.",
      "It said that by stopping customers from \"paying for undeserved bonuses\", it was looking \"to sharpen executive mindsets\" and to push firms to improve their cultures of performance and accountability."

      "The UK needs more nuclear energy to power the data centres needed for artificial intelligence (AI), the boss of the world's largest cloud computing company has said.",
      "Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is part of the retail giant Amazon, plans to spend \u00a38bn on new data centres in the UK over the next four years.",
      "A data centre is a warehouse filled with computers that remotely power services such as AI, data processing, and streaming, but a single one can use the same amount of energy as a small town.",
      "Matt Garman, chief executive of AWS, told the BBC nuclear is a \"great solution\" to data centres' energy needs as \"an excellent source of zero carbon, 24/7 power\".",
      "AWS is the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world and has funded more than 40 renewable solar and wind farm projects in the UK.",
      "The UK's 500 data centres currently consume 2.5% of all electricity in the UK, while Ireland's 80 hoover up 21% of the country's total power, with those numbers projected to hit 6% and 30% respectively by 2030.",
      "The body that runs the UK's power grid estimates that by 2050 data centres alone will use nearly as much energy as all industrial users consume today.",
      "In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Matt Garman said that future energy needs were central to AWS planning process.",
      "\"It's something we plan many years out,\" he said.",
      "\"We invest ahead. I think the world is going to have to build new technologies. I believe nuclear is a big part of that particularly as we look 10 years out.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Amazon cuts hundreds of jobs in cloud business",
      "Trump calls Bezos as Amazon says no plan to show tariff price rises",
      "French company EDF is currently building a giant new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset and a decision to build another one at Sizewell in Suffolk is pending. EDF's UK Chair Alex Chisholm unsurprisingly agrees with Mr Garman.",
      "\"Why are data centre providers turning to nuclear? They will need a lot of energy, reliably,\" Mr Chisholm told the BBC.",
      "\"Replication of Hinkley Point C, alongside the roll out of SMRs, can power Britain's digital economy.\"",
      "SMRs refers to small modular reactors which are the size of a football stadium as opposed to the size of a whole town, like Sizewell or Hinkley.",
      "Amazon is already partnering with SMR firms in Washington and Virginia to develop SMRs and would be a natural customer for Rolls Royce which is developing its own SMR designs here.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero told the BBC that modular reactors \"will play a particularly important roles in growing energy-hungry sectors like AI and we're shaking up the planning rules to make it easier to build nuclear power stations across the country\"",
      "But this technology is many years away and new grid connections already take years to establish.",
      "Jess Ralston at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said: \"Investors can be waiting years for grid connections holding back growth.\"",
      "\"Nuclear could be a way of supply data centre's power needs, but hardly any SMRs have been built anywhere in the world and traditional nuclear remains very expensive and takes a long time to build. So, it may be a while, if ever, for this to be a viable solution\".",
      "AI regulation",
      "AWS estimates that 52% of businesses are using AI in some way \u2013 with a new business adopting it at a rate of one a minute. Mr Garman said this is a good thing.",
      "\"AI is one of the most transformative technologies since the internet. It's going to have a significant effect on almost every part of our lives.\"",
      "He said he understands why many are nervous.",
      "\"With any technology that is sufficiently new or hard to understand, people are probably appropriately scared of it initially, until they better understand it so that initial response is not particularly surprising.\"",
      "He added that he \"would caution against\" international regulation.",
      "\"The technology is moving at such a rate that I don't believe there's the knowledge of the folks that are building those regulations are going to be able to keep up.",
      "\"I think the most likely case is that those regulations would accomplish the exact inverse thing they are trying to do.\"",
      "However, he admitted he thinks a lot about the responsibility of releasing AI into the world.",
      "\"Anytime you're building that much of a transformational technology, its important to think about those controls and guardrails so that it can go towards the betterment of society not the detriment.",
      "\"So absolutely. I think a ton about that, for sure.\"",

      "Government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m at a rate of 20% \u2013 half the usual rate \u2013 saw protests across the UK after they were announced in the Autumn Budget.",

      "Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double trade to $500bn, but Delhi is unlikely to offer concessions in sectors such as agriculture where there are deeper political sensitivities involved.",
      "India has recently shown more openness to doing trade deals after years of scepticism.",
      "Last week, it inked a trade pact with the UK that will substantially slash duties in many protected sectors like whisky and automobiles.",

    "summary": "The Caribbean island is building a power station that will use steam naturally heated by volcanic rock.",
    "story": [
      "With rainforests, waterfalls, volcanoes and hot springs, the Caribbean island of Dominica's dramatic landscape is a haven for adventure-seeking ecotourists.",
      "It attracted 83,966 visitors last year, a 13% rise from 2023, and led by new direct flights from the US, and the opening of more hotels.",
      "Nicknamed the \"Nature Island\", and now recovered from the extensive damage caused by 2017's Hurricane Maria, Dominica's government is set to harness its natural resources to generate clean electricity for its 66,000 residents and tourism sector.",
      "To end the country's long reliance on generators fuelled by imported diesel, a geothermal power station is being built in the south of the country. It will access the boiling hot water contained in natural underground reservoirs that are heated by the surrounding volcanic rock.",
      "The 10-megawatt plant, under construction near the village of Laudat in the lush Roseau Valley, is on track to become operational by the end of the year.",
      "Steam will be drawn up to the surface to drive turbines that will generate electricity. The used steam will then be cooled to the point where it becomes water again, and reinjected back underground for the process to restart.",
      "Dominica country profile",
      "\"We hope to totally eliminate the need for diesel generation for electricity in Dominica by 2030,\" Dominica's energy minister Dr Vince Henderson tells the BBC. The government also says that the geothermal plant will reduce electricity bills.",
      "And it is not just Dominica (not to be confused with the similarly named Dominican Republic), that is set to benefit. Long-term plans include exporting surplus electricity via undersea cables to neighbouring islands.",
      "Dr Henderson adds that he hopes the success of the geothermal plant will inspire other Caribbean nations to explore more renewable energy sources.",
      "Dominica's geothermal plant will be just the second in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France, has had a 15-megawatt station in operation for three decades.",
      "The Roseau Valley facility is being created through a public-private partnership between the Dominican government and US-Israeli renewable energy company Ormat Technologies.",
      "It is costing tens of millions of US dollars, partially funded by grants and investments from several governments, including the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand. Additional funding has come from various non-governmental organizations from around the world, and loans from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).",
      "The Dominican government has also ploughed significant resources into the project, which required high upfront costs and a complex exploration process including drilling deep underground to test temperatures.",
      "\"Finding the resource is the first challenge. Then you need someone like us to build the facility,\" says Ormat's chief executive Doron Blachar. \"Ormat is doing the entire project, from making the plant's elements, shipping them to Dominica, mainly from Israel, and then constructing the power plant.\"",
      "Ormat has been designing and building renewable energy systems for more than five decades, and owns and operates geothermal plants in various countries from the Americas to Africa.",
      "\"Geothermal is a great, zero-emission electricity that doesn't depend on wind or sun, and operates 24/7,\" Mr Blachar explains. \"It brings jobs to a country, both during construction and, more importantly, during the plant's operations, along with new technology and expertise.\"",
      "Yet despite geothermal's green credentials, Dominica's new plant has raised concerns among some local residents, including environmentalist Atherton Martin who fears for the effects on the ecologically valuable Roseau Valley.",
      "\"There is no other area like it in the Caribbean,\" he says, adding that the removal of vegetation during the exploration process \"decimated wildlife\" including endemic frogs.",
      "Other residents told the BBC of some controversy over the amount of money the project was costing. It has certainly been several years in the making with the Dominican government alone said to have invested around $15m (\u00a311.3m).",
      "Dr Henderson admits that the project is \"not easy\" for a country that \"faced a big challenge\" when it had to substantially repair its electricity network after 2017's Hurricane Maria. But he insists \"it will be worth it in the end\".",
      "Another common fear about geothermal plants is the potential for triggering earthquakes.",
      "Ormat says it has never had a such an incident in its many years of operations.",
      "Mr Blachar believes the Caribbean could become \"a hub\" for geothermal technology.",
      "Ormat acquired Guadeloupe's plant from the French government in 2017 and is currently expanding it to boost its capacity to 25 megawatts.",
      "With support from the CDB and driven by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission, work is also under way to explore and develop geothermal potential in fellow volcanic island nations Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.",
      "Ormat will operate the Dominica plant for 20 years before handing it over to state electricity provider Domlec. Mr Blachar estimates it will employ around 30 local people when it comes on stream later this year.",
      "It should initially generate enough power to meet half of Dominica's peak electricity demand, says Fred John, managing director of the government-owned Dominica Geothermal Development Company, which is also involved in the scheme.",
      "Authorities are confident the plant will then soon support the entire country, and have enough spare electricity for some to be exported to neighbouring islands.",
      "Mr John says that the facility will \"serve as a test case for an attractive alternative\" to fossil fuels. \"The rest of the OECS will benefit from the lessons learned here \u2013 both what worked and what didn't,\" he adds.",
      "The OECS recently set a target to reach 30% renewable energy within 10 years, with some countries, including Dominica and St Kitts, aiming for 100% by then.",
      "OECS Director General Dr Didacus Jules describes Dominica's geothermal project as a \"bold and visionary step\".",
      "\"As a region heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, the transition to green energy is not optional - it is existential,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This development also breathes new life into the long-held vision of a regional energy grid - one that connects our islands through clean, reliable, and affordable energy.\""

      "Yet with two high-speed rail (HSR) projects now under construction, and others planned, is the US finally on track to start catching up with the fast trains seen in China, Japan and Europe?",
      "Rick Harnish, of US campaign group High Speed Rail Alliance, says it is at least good to see the first two schemes being built.",

      "Globally, there are 23 nations with HSR, according to Mr Harnish. His non-profit organisation has the sole mission of bringing it to the US.",
      "Allowing HSR trains to run safely is far from straightforward, he adds. \"You can't have any crossings with highways, it needs to be very straight and a sealed corridor.\"",
      "In China the country is still building more and more HSR lines, with the total distance expected to reach around 60,000km by 2030.",
      "Chinese cities that get HSR links see their economies increase by 14.2%, according to data from Denmark-based think tank 21st Europe.",
      "Chinese firms are also helping to build HSR systems in other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Will Doig, who wrote a book called High-Speed Empire, Chinese Expansion, and the Future of Southeast Asia, says that China is not just interested in helping its neighbours improve their rail networks.",
      "\"It is a way of China spreading its influence across a region that it felt was geopolitically strategic,\" he says.",
      "\"In some of these cases, countries have taken out loans from China so that China can then build the railways.\" He warns that this may put them \"in a position where they're beholden to China\".",

      "His think tank is now calling for further expansion of HSR, so that it connects most capitals and main cities in the EU, and those in the UK.",
      "Mr Pour says that if the US wants to develop HSR it needs to start with a cultural shift, a move towards more public transport, and asking itself \"what type of future does it want?\".",
      "Mr Harnish from the High Speed Rail Alliance says that in order for HSR to work in the US, \"the federal government is an essential component\".",

      "Will Doig says that going forward he would love to see China helping to build more HSR in the US, but that he is not holding his breath.",
      "\"It's politically very difficult,\" he says. \"Which is too bad because without the animosity between the US and China, you could see how a partnership between them could really create great things for America, that America is not so good at building itself.\""

    "story": [
      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",
      "The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.",
      "While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.",
      "An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.",
      "Priced around $150 (\u00a3120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.",
      "He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads.",
      "For all this, his \"dream\" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon.",

      "Average private school fees were 22% higher in January 2025 than in January 2024, according to the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents most independent schools in the UK.",
      "The government introduced VAT on school fees in January to pay for more state school teachers in England.",
      "But the ISC and a number of families have taken the government to the High Court over claims the policy is discriminatory and breaches human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods and services. The standard rate of VAT is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education. That exemption was removed on 1 January.",
      "About half of England's private schools are charities, which means that they also received an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "The government removed that tax relief in April, but dropped earlier plans to scrap private schools' charitable status entirely.",
      "How will the government spend the extra VAT raised?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in the 2024/25 financial year, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",

      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",

      "It blamed the \"triple whammy\" of higher national insurance contributions, an end to charitable business rates relief and the introduction of VAT.",

      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period did not fall.",
      "Will the VAT changes mean the number of private pupils will fall?",
      "When it announced the VAT increase, the government said it did not expect there to be a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "According to a Treasury memo seen by the BBC, initial estimates suggested that 54,000 pupils would be displaced, with most moving to state schools within the first two years.",
      "However, the government now predicts that around 35,000 students will move to the state sector over a longer time period, and that class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which said that state system could \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The ISC says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in the number of Year 7 pupils starting school in September 2024.",
      "It believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by the ISC, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argue that the policy goes against the legal right to an education, and claim it is discriminatory because it affects families attending low-paying faith schools.",
      "The group also cites the effect on children with Send. Those who attend private school because their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" but who do not have an EHCP have to pay VAT.",
      "The court was told that the government had considered introducing the policy in September 2025, rather than in January.",
      "But it rejected this idea because the main objective of the VAT change was to raise additional tax revenue to support the 94% of children who attend state schools, and any delay would have undermined that.",
      "Government lawyers argued that families who wished to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" were free to send their children to private school or to educate them at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider amending the policy, but would be under no obligation to do so."

      "It is the third time Austria has won the contest, with previous victories going to Udo J\u00fcrgens' Merci, Cherie in 1966; and Conchita Wurst with Rise Like a Phoenix in 2014. JJ was inspired to take part in Eurovision by Conchita.",
      "The singer had always been one of the favourites to win, but the most hotly-tipped contestants were Sweden's KAJ - whose tongue-in-cheek ode to sauna culture, Bara Bada Bastu, ultimately took fourth place.",
      "Speaking after the show, JJ said he was \"so pleased\" that viewers had connected with his story of heartache.",

      "Malta's Mariana Conte was forced to rewrite her disco anthem Serving Kant to remove what sounded like a swear word - but performed the censored version with a knowing wink, safe in the knowledge the audience would fill in the blanks.",
      "Although it was a fan favourite, Conte could only manage 17th.",

      "In a touching climax, the 21-year-old danced with an image of his childhood self in a mirror on the stage.",
      "Also reflecting on their childhood was French singer Louane, whose tearjerking ballad was dedicated to her mother, who died of cancer when she was 17.",
      "In one of the night's most striking performances, she was surrounded by a whirlwind of sand as she hollered the word \"mother\" over and over again.",
      "One of the favourites to win, it ended the night in seventh place, after receiving a disappointing 50 points from the public.",
      "JJ's performance was similarly dramatic. Shot entirely in black and white, it saw him being tossed around on a rickety boat, as waves (of emotion) threatened to consume him.",
      "An honourable mention also goes to Italy's Lucio Corsi, whose harmonica solo in Volevo Essere Un Duro marked the first time a live instrument has been played at Eurovision since 1998.",
      "The UK spent a third year in the bottom half of the leaderboard, despite a spirited performance from girl group Remember Monday.",

      "The voting was chaotic overall.",
      "Thirteen of the 26 finalists received the maximum of 12 points from at least one jury, leaving the competition completely open before the public vote was counted.",
      "Israel, who had been languishing in the bottom half of the table, then received 297 points from the public (out of a possible maximum of 444). Twelve of those points came from the UK.",
      "For a while, it looked like Yuval Raphael's lead might be unassailable - but Austria's tally of 178 was the last to be announced, leaving the singer empty-handed.",
      "There was disappointment, too, for fans of Canadian singer C\u00e9line Dion, who had been rumoured to appear at the contest.",
      "The singer won Eurovision for Switzerland in 1988, and had appeared in a video wishing the contestants good luck at Tuesday's semi-final.",
      "Despite hopes from Eurovision organisers that she might turn up, the moment never came to pass."

      "In a trial that is undoing the legacy of one of music's biggest moguls of the 2000s, the focus of the opening week of proceedings was not Sean \"Diddy\" Combs  himself - but his ex-girlfriend.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura took the witness stand for four days, describing in emotional details the years of beatings and drug-fuelled sex encounters with prostitutes that she alleges she endured at the hands of the rap superstar, who she dated for more than a decade.",
      "But while her story clearly left an impression on those in the courtroom, which one onlooker described as an \"aura of sadness\", it is just one piece in the puzzle that prosecutors must present to prove that Mr Combs was not just an abuser, but a mastermind of a criminal, sexual enterprise.",
      "On Tuesday, gasps erupted in a Manhattan overflow courtroom when prosecutors called Ms Ventura - their star witness - to the stand. All eyes were fixed on the eight-months pregnant singer, as she strolled past her ex-boyfriend, whom she had not seen in six years.",
      "Ms Ventura was there to testify in the federal sex trafficking, racketeering and prostitution case against Mr Combs, whom she accuses of abusing her and coercing her into unwanted sex acts - so-called \"freak-offs\" - during their 11-and-a-half year relationship.",

      "An aspiring musician falls in love with a 'larger-than-life' rapper",
      "On her first day on the stand, Ms Ventura began by taking prosecutors through the start of her tumultuous relationship with Mr Combs, whom she met when she was a 19-year-old aspiring musician. Mr Combs, 17 years her senior, signed her onto his record label.",
      "Their romantic relationship began soon after, when Ms Ventura fell in love with the \"larger-than-life\" musician and entrepreneur, she said. But it was not long before she noticed a \"different\" side to him, Ms Ventura testified, at times wiping the tears from her eyes.",
      "Mr Combs, she said, wanted to control every aspect of her life. He paid for her rent, her car, and her phone, sometimes taking the items away to \"punish\" her when he was upset, she said.",
      "Eventually, the relationship turned violent. She testified about the time when he attacked her because she was sleeping, slashing her eyebrow as he threw her onto the corner of her bed as her two friends tried to stop him. The court was shown a photo of the gash that Ms Ventura said Mr Combs hired a plastic surgeon to fix secretly. There was another time at a party where he kicked her head as she cowered behind a toilet in a bathroom stall, she said.",
      "While jurors remained concentrated on her testimony and the evidence, betraying little emotion, some in the courtroom wiped away tears or looked away from the graphic photos and videos - including the viral video of Mr Combs beating and dragging Ms Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Published by CNN last year, the video has been viewed by millions - including many of the jurors before they were seated in the trial - and Ms Ventura, who was forced to rewatch the incident of abuse several times this week.",
      "Freak-offs become 'a job'",
      "Ms Ventura testified that the hotel incident took place after she tried to leave a \"freak-off\", a sexual encounter in which the couple would hire male escorts to have sex with Ms Ventura while Mr Combs watched and recorded from the corner.",
      "Ms Ventura said the rapper introduced her to freak-offs around a year into their relationship, and at first, she did it to make him happy.",
      "But over time, the encounters humiliated her, she said. They would sometimes last as long as four days, and require Ms Ventura to take countless drugs to stay awake, she said. She endured injuries like painful urinary tract infections - and once even blacked out, waking up in the shower, she said.",
      "\"It made me feel worthless,\" she told the court. \"Freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.\"",
      "The couple would go on to have \"hundreds\" of freak-offs, Ms Ventura estimated.",
      "After years of temporary break-ups - some fuelled by Mr Combs' affairs - Ms Ventura ended her relationship with Mr Combs for good in 2018, the same year she alleges the rapper raped her in her home as she cried.",
      "Ms Ventura went on to date and marry her personal trainer, Alex Fine, with whom she has two children, but the trauma of her relationship has stayed with her.",
      "Through tears, Ms Ventura told the court of a time two years ago when she considered taking her own life, when traumatic flashbacks of her time with Mr Combs became too much to handle. Her husband helped her seek therapy to recover, she said.",

      "Mr Combs's attorneys have already conceded that the rapper was abusive - and have argued they would not have fought a domestic violence case against him. But, \"domestic violence is not sex trafficking\", Mr Combs' attorney Teny Geragos argued this week.",
      "The federal government has charged Mr Combs with transportation to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion.",
      "He is also charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy, or directing an illegal enterprise under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The statute was created to take on mob bosses, but has since been used in other cases, including sex trafficking, such as the case against disgraced R&B singer R Kelly.",
      "Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson used parts of Ms Ventura's story to boost this case, asking her about the guns the rapper had access to and the ways he allegedly blackmailed her.",
      "Ms Ventura told the court of a time when she said Mr Combs pulled up videos he recorded of their freak-offs on his laptop, in view of others on a commercial flight. She said he told her he would release them if she didn't behave.",
      "\"I felt trapped,\" Ms Ventura said.",

      "Prosecutors have asked Ms Ventura about security guards who she said stood by while Mr Combs abused her. Ms Ventura has testified about Mr Combs' employees' involvement in setting up freak-offs with supplies like baby oil, and booking travel for the male escorts they hired.",
      "Mr Combs' team says jealousy and drugs fuelled violence",
      "After a day and a half on the stand, it was Mr Combs' attorneys turn to question Ms Ventura.",
      "The rapper's lawyer, Anna Estevao, relied on hundreds of pages of text messages between Mr Combs and Ms Ventura to help push her team's broader arguments: that Ms Ventura was a willing participant in freak-offs in a toxic relationship fuelled by drugs and jealousy.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team showed messages from Ms Ventura to Mr Combs in which she said she was \"always ready\" for a freak-off, and another time when she said she wished they could have had one.",
      "Ms Ventura acknowledged writing the messages while adding that those were \"just words at that point\".",
      "Ms Estevao also kept bringing Ms Ventura back to the couple's moments of infidelity, like when Mr Combs would spend holidays with his family and former girlfriend Kim Porter, or when Ms Ventura began dating rapper Kid Cudi while she and Mr Combs were on a break.",
      "She repeatedly asked Ms Ventura about her drug use and how both she and Mr Combs struggled with opioid addiction at times.",
      "In these moments, the defence was trying to show jurors that it was a toxic, violent and complicated relationship - but not a case of racketeering or sex trafficking, former federal prosecutor Sarah Krissoff told the BBC.",
      "The defence also made efforts to try to chip away at the government's racketeering case, asking Ms Ventura whether Mr Combs' employees had actually witnessed the freak-offs, to which Ms Ventura said she did not think so.",
      "Ultimately, Mr Fudali said, the prosecution's case will hinge on this question of compliance versus consent - whether Mr Combs' girlfriends were willing participants in his sexual fantasies or acted out of fear.",
      "\"Did Ms Ventura consent or was she coerced into complying?\" Mr Fudali said. \"That seems to be the question for the jury.\"",

    "story": [
      "Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom.",
      "First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry.",
      "But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025.",
      "Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges.",
      "'You know exactly what you're getting'",
      "While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face.",
      "\"There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,\" says executive producer Marty Stratton.",
      "Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts.",
      "There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as \"forever games\".",
      "In the latest Online Nation report by UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P.",
      "Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher.",
      "Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can \"fit into those habits\".",
      "\"It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,\" he says.",
      "The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase.",
      "But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players.",
      "Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is.",
      "\"The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,\" he says.",
      "One way of doing this is by attracting new players.",
      "Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new \"Medieval sci-fi\" setting and altered gameplay style.",
      "\"We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,\" he says.",
      "The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages.",
      "\"In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,\" says Hugo.",
      "But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry.",
      "The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years.",
      "In 2010, a new game cost roughly \u00a340 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time.",
      "If you take into account inflation (using this Bank of England tool), that would be about \u00a360 in today's money.",
      "Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs \u00a369.99 for a standard edition or almost \u00a3100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included.",
      "\"When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,\" says Marty.",
      "The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers.",
      "That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players.",
      "But Doom producer Marty argues that \"free\" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are \"no unknown expenses\" with a one-off purchase such as Doom.",
      "\"You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,\" he says.",
      "F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from \"microtransactions\" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds.",
      "Those costs can mount up, and a recent poll of 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about \u00a322 a month on those transactions.",
      "That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a \"curated experience\" with \"replay value\".",
      "\"Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,\" he says.",
      "Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more \"fiddling with prices\" and surcharges \"to see what customers are willing to pay\" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases.",

    "story": [
      "Ozwald Boateng, celebrating four decades of making his indelible mark on the fashion industry, got his chance to stamp his style on the Met Gala in New York earlier this month.",
      "The esteemed British-Ghanaian designer for the first time dressed celebrities - including three of Africa's biggest musicians, Tems, Burna Boy and Arya Starr, as well as actors Ncuti Gatwa and Jaden Smith - at what is seen as his industry's biggest night of the year.",
      "The theme - Superfine: Tailoring Black Style - was \"completely in my wheelhouse\", he says, as it looked at the way that style formed black identities.",
      "Given that he already has a robust legacy in the design world, the 58-year-old saw the opportunity to find fresh adherents to the Boateng look.",
      "\"I think it's, in a way, communicating to a new audience,\" he tells the BBC a few days after the showcase.",
      "Throughout his 40 years in fashion, the designer has built a reputation for challenging the norms of men's tailoring. His eponymous brand sells form-fitting, stylish suits, often accented with bold colours and West African-inspired patterns.",
      "The son of Ghanaian immigrants, Boateng reimagined the country's iconic kente cloth to produce his signature \"tribal\" pattern.",
      "\"It's all about having a strong concept, having a thorough idea of what you want to achieve from the textiles,\" he says.",
      "The Met Gala perfectly matched his outlook. \"Being a theme about black culture and black cultural influence, I mean, how can you do that without Africa?\" he asks.",
      "Considering the link to Ghana, Boateng explains: \"When we were colonised by the Europeans or the Brits, we kept our traditional dress, but tailoring was a big part of how we dressed to look more... effectively more European.",
      "\"My father always wore tailored suits. You had to be smart at all times, that was something I was taught.\"",
      "As if producing outfits for 16 celebrities for fashion's premier event was not stressful enough, Boateng switched up Burna Boy's outfit less than 24 hours before the event.",
      "\"We did his fitting quite literally the night before the Met Gala,\" Boateng says, adding that everyone in the room got \"really excited\" when they saw the Grammy-award winning musician in the finished product.",
      "The look -  a red suit paired with a buttercup yellow shirt and eel-skin cape - was partly inspired by Burna Boy's Nigerian roots.",
      "The musician told Vogue: \"As a waterside pikin [Pidgin for \"child\"] from the Niger Delta, the eel and fish in general are the lifeblood of my people - they symbolise survival, spirit and the flow of tradition through generations.\"",
      "The Met Gala was \"not unusual\", Boateng says, explaining that Africa has been part of his \"message\" throughout his career.",
      "Back in 1995, Boateng was the first black designer to open a shop on Savile Row, a London street famed for fine tailoring.",
      "\"When I first started as a designer, Savile as a street was a dying street,\" Boateng recalls.",
      "\"The concept, it was dying. I effectively moved there in the early 90s and breathed new life into it.\"",
      "Boateng was dubbed the \"peacock of Savile Row\" - with his flamboyance, 6ft-something frame and modelesque facial features, he stood out among his neighbours.",
      "Colour and flair had long been part of Boateng's psyche. At five years old his favourite outfit was a purple, mohair suit made by his mother, who was a seamstress.",
      "Young Boateng commandeered his mother's sewing machine and although he initially chose to study computing at college, he switched to fashion after realising menswear was his future.",
      "As a teenager, Boateng was greatly inspired by tailoring titan Giorgio Armani - and decades later, Armani would praise the London designer for his \"elegance\" and \"cutting edge\" designs.",
      "Boateng opened his first studio in his early 20s, dressing the likes of Mick Jagger, Jimmy Paige and Spike Lee.",
      "He then opened his Savile Row store - at the age of 28 he was the youngest to ever do so.",
      "The burgeoning designer captivated London's fashion scene initially, but in 1998 he went bankrupt when an economic downturn in east Asia scuppered a major order.",
      "Both his professional and personal life descended into disarray - in just 12 months an entire collection was stolen from his studio and his marriage broke down.",
      "But the peacock strutted his way back. Boateng gradually rebuilt his business and in 2002 moved into bigger premises on Savile Row.",
      "Since then, he has served as Givency's creative director for menswear, been awarded an OBE, designed staff uniforms for British Airways and branched out into womenswear.",
      "While racking up professional and charitable commitments, Boateng was raising two children.",
      "Now adults, Oscar and Emilia Boateng accompanied their father to the Met Gala, dressed in the suits that made their surname one of the most famous in contemporary British tailoring.",
      "They are not, however, keen to follow their father into fashion design.",
      "\"I'm trying to slowly but surely seduce them into the fashion business,\" Boateng jokes.",
      "\"It is ultimately their decision to decide what they want from their life. If they find something they're passionate about in a way I have, I am happy.\"",
      "And what is next for his own passion? Boateng might have a brain brimming with concepts, but he has a clear vision of where he wants his brand to go next.",
      "\"The future is expansion,\" he says, \"raising capital to really, really push the brand globally\".",
      "\"I think it's the moment in time - and it's the right moment.\"",

      "The sheriff's department told the BBC in a statement that its Special Victims Bureau was \"actively investigating criminal allegations involving William Robinson AKA 'Smokey Robinson.' The investigation is in the early stages, and we have no further comment.\"",
      "The women filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on 6 May under the pseudonyms Jane Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4.",
      "In the 27-page legal action, they allege several incidents that they say dated back to 2006, and accuse Mr Robinson of pressuring them into sex.",
      "All four women, who are of Hispanic descent, said they had not come forward until now because they feared losing their livelihoods, familial reprisal or embarrassment. Some were concerned the allegations could affect their immigration status.",
      "They are seeking at least $50m (\u00a338m) in damages and a jury trial.",
      "Mr Robinson was Motown's first hitmaker, writing number one records like Mary Wells' My Guy and The Temptations' My Girl.",
      "He was both a talent scout for the record label and one of its most prominent recording artists in his own right, known for songs like Tracks of My Tears, Shop Around and Tears of a Clown.",
      "He has spots in both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and claims to have credits on more than 4,000 songs.",
      "The women's lawyers held a press conference last week after filing the lawsuit, accusing Mr Robinson of being a \"serial and sick rapist\" who \"must be stopped\".",
      "Mr Robinson's legal team called the event a \"bizarre\" attempt \"to enlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create\".",
      "\"We will have more to say in the coming days as we make our legal response, and in time Mr Robinson will respond in his own words,\" Mr Frost said, noting that the musician's legal team plans to ask for the case to be dismissed.",
      "\"We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold.\"",

      "It was the first victory for a non-binary performer in Eurovision history and the first for Switzerland since C\u00e9line Dion won in 1988.",
      "Looking back, 12 months later, the singer says the experience \"turned my life upside down, in the best way possible.\"",
      "\"The most important thing was [that] I gained a lot of self confidence in myself as an artist.",
      "\"It adds a level of relaxation to the creation process, because I know I can trust my gut when it comes to writing songs and performance.\"",

      "\"It's such a nice thing to have everybody so supporting each other,\" says Claude, who is representing the Netherlands.",
      "\"Like, if somebody forgot something in their home country, they'd just be like, 'Does somebody have like, a charger?' and the reply would come, 'Oh yes, you can come pick it up at my hotel room'. It's so fun!\"",

      "\"There's a lot of expectations,\" they explain.",
      "\"The media at home is like, 'Oh, we're not happy with this entry, it's going to fail.'",
      "\"Or they take the complete opposite [approach] of, 'This has to win. And if it's not winning, we're really disappointed.'",
      "Nemo remembers that feeling well.",
      "This time last year, they were the bookmakers' third favourite, but saw off frontrunners Croatia and Israel with a high-risk performance that saw them dancing on a tilted, spinning platform, while hitting improbable high notes for three long minutes.",
      "\"I had moments where I was like, 'Please just don't fall. Whatever you do, don't fall,'\" they laugh.",
      "\"And then I got lucky seven times, because you're rehearsing, then you have the jury show, and it all leads up to the final performance.",
      "\"I was like, 'It's gone right seven times. What are the chances that, in this moment, it will go wrong?'",
      "\"So I trusted in the moment, and everything went fine, but I could have been the biggest loser in the history of Switzerland!\"",
      "Instead, they topped the table and lifted the trophy... before promptly breaking it in two.",

      "\"I rarely understand my thoughts / I write them down before I sleep... What if I'm unexplainable?\"",

      "Thirty-five seconds to make sure the props are in place and tightly secured.",
      "While you're at home watching the introductory videos known as postcards, dozens of people swarm the stage, setting the scene for whatever comes next.",
      "\"We call it the Formula 1 tyre change,\" says Richard van Rouwendaal, the affable  Dutch stage manager who makes it all work.",
      "\"Each person in the crew can only do one thing. You run on stage with one light bulb or one prop. You always walk on the same line. If you go off course, you will hit somebody.",
      "\"It's a bit like ice skating.\"",
      "The stage crew start rehearsing their \"F1 tyre change\" weeks before the contestants even arrive.",
      "Every country sends detailed plans of their staging, and Eurovision hires stand-ins to play the acts (in Liverpool 2023, it was pupils from the local performing arts school), while stagehands start shaving precious seconds off the changeovers.",
      "\"We have about two weeks,\" says Van Rouwendaal, who's normally based in Utrecht but is in Basel for this year's contest.",
      "\"My company is around 13 Dutchies and 30 local guys and girls, who rock it in Switzerland.",
      "\"In those two weeks, I have to figure out who's right for each job. Someone's good at running, someone's good at lifting, someone's good at organising the backstage area. It is a bit like being good at Tetris because you have to line everything up in a small space, in the perfect way.\"",
      "As soon as a song finishes, the team are ready to roll.",
      "As well as the stagehands, there are people responsible for positioning lights and setting pyrotechnics; and 10 cleaners who sweep the stage with mops and vacuum cleaners between every performance.",
      "\"My cleaners are just as important as the stage crew. You need a clean stage for the dancers  - but also, if there's an overhead shot of somebody lying down, you don't want to see shoeprints on the floor.\"",
      "The attention to detail is clinical. Backstage, every performer has their own microphone stand, set to the correct height and angle, to make sure every  performance is camera perfect.",
      "\"Sometimes the delegation will say the artist wants to wear a different shoe for the grand final,\" says Van Rouwendaal. \"But if that happens, the mic stand is at the wrong height, so we've got a problem!\"",
      "Spontaneously changing footwear isn't the worst problem he's faced, though. At the 2022 contest in Turin, the stage was 10m (33ft) higher than the backstage area.",
      "As a result, they were pushing heavy stage props \u2013 including a mechanical bull \u2013 up a steep ramp between every act.",
      "\"We were exhausted every night,\" he recalls. \"This year is better. We've even got an extra backstage tent where we prepare the props.\"",
      "Props are a huge part of Eurovision. The tradition started at the second ever contest in 1957, when Germany's Margot Hielscher sang part of her song Telefon, Telefon into (you guessed it) a telephone.",
      "Over the intervening decades, the staging has become ever more elaborate. In 2014, Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk trapped one of her dancers in a giant hamster wheel, while Romania brought a literal cannon to their performance in 2017.",

      "\"It's all organised in a kind of a circle. The [props] come onto the stage from the left, and then get taken off to the right.",
      "\"Backstage, the props that have been used are pushed back to the back of the queue, and so on. It's all in the planning.\"",
      "'Smuggling routes'",
      "During the show, there are several secret passageways and \"smuggling routes\" to get props in and out of vision, especially when a performance requires new elements half-way through.",
      "Cast your mind back, if you will, to Sam Ryder's performance for the UK at the 2022 contest in Italy.",
      "There he was, alone on the stage, belting out falsetto notes in his spangly jumpsuit, when suddenly, an electric guitar appeared out of thin air and landed in his hands.",

      "\"I'm a magician,\" he laughs. \"No, no, no\u2026 That was a collaboration between the camera director, the British delegation and the stage crew.\"",
      "In other words, Richard ducked onto the stage, guitar in hand, while the director cut to a wide shot, concealing his presence from viewers at home.",
      "\"It's choreographed to the nearest millimetre,\" he says. \"We're not invisible, but we have to be invisible.\"",
      "What if it all goes wrong?",
      "There are certain tricks the audience will never notice, Van Rouwendaal reveals.",
      "If he announces \"stage not clear\" into his headset, the director can buy time by showing an extended shot of the audience.",
      "In the event of a bigger incident \u2013 \"a camera can break, a prop can fall\" \u2013 they cut to a presenter in the green room, who can fill for a couple of minutes.",
      "Up in the control room, a tape of the dress rehearsal plays in sync with the live show, allowing directors to switch to pre-recorded footage in the event of something like a stage invasion or a malfunctioning microphone.",
      "A visual glitch isn't enough to trigger the back-up tape, however - as Switzerland's Zo\u00eb M\u00eb discovered at Tuesday's first semi-final.",
      "Her performance was briefly interrupted when the feed from an on-stage camera froze, but producers simply cut to a wide shot until it was fixed. (If it had happened in the final, she'd have been offered the chance to perform again.)",
      "\"There's actually lots of measures that are being taken to make sure that every act can be shown in the best way,\" says Reist.",
      "\"There are people who know the regulations by heart, who have been playing through what could happen and what we would do in various different situations.",
      "\"I'll be sitting next to our head of production, and if there's [a situation] where somebody has to run, maybe that's going to be me!\"",
      "It's no surprise to learn that staging a live three-hour broadcast with thousands of moving parts is incredibly stressful.",
      "This year, organisers have introduced measures to protect the welfare of contestants and crew, including closed-door rehearsals, longer breaks between shows, and the creation of a \"disconnected zone\" where cameras are banned.",
      "Even so, Reist says she has worked every weekend for the past two months, while Van Rouwendaal and his team are regularly pulling 20-hour days.",
      "The shifts are so long that, back in 2008, Eurovision production legend Ola Melzig  built a bunker under the stage, complete with a sofa, a \"sadly underused\" PS3 and two (yes, two) espresso machines.",
      "\"I don't have hidden luxuries like Ola. I'm not at that level yet!\" laughs Van Rouwendaal",
      "\"But backstage, I've got a spot with my crew. We've got stroopwafels there and, last week, it was King's Day in Holland, so I baked pancakes for everyone.",
      "\"I try to make it fun. Sometimes we go out and have a drink and cheer because we had a great day.",
      "\"Yes, we have to be on top, and we have to be sharp as a knife, but having fun together is also very important.\"",

      "Dion's video message came during the ceremony's interval, as votes were being cast.",
      "Although she was unable to be there in person, it was a coup for organisers. The singer has stepped away from the limelight in recent years due to health issues related to stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a neurological condition that causes muscle spasms and makes it difficult for her to walk.",

      "Taking a lighter note was Estonia's Tommy Cash, whose quirky anthem Espresso Macchiato was interrupted by a \"stage invader\" - actually a dancer who replicated his noodle-limbed dance moves.",
      "The arena was awash with Ukranian flags for Ziferblat, whose prog-pop anthem Bird Of Pray is a message of hope and resilience to families separated by the country's ongoing war with Russia.",
      "Italy's Lucio Corsi brought 70s glam rock vibes with his track Volevo Esse Un Duro, which even featured a visual call-back to David Bowie and Mick Ronson's iconic 1972  performance of Starman on Top Of The Pops.",

    "story": [
      "Since Remember Monday were announced as the UK's Eurovision act in March, they've barely slept in their own beds.",
      "\"It's definitely in the single digits,\" says singer Holly-Anne Hull, trying to calculate how many nights she has spent at home. \"We don't have time for that.\"",
      "Instead, they've been on a whirlwind tour of Europe, meeting fans, filming endless TikToks and performing their song, What The Hell Just Happened, to anyone who'll listen.",
      "If they're tired, it doesn't show. The country-pop trio \u2013 Lauren Byrne, Holly-Anne Hull and Charlotte Steele \u2013 are chatty, excited and focused on fun, and for good reason.",
      "They formed at school over a decade ago, and determinedly stayed together during long periods where, in their words, \"no-one was listening\".",
      "Even after a successful turn on The Voice in 2019, Charlotte had to return to her job as a deputy head teacher, while Lauren and Holly-Anne appeared in West End shows like Phantom of the Opera and Six: The Musical.",

      "Live: Eurovision fans prepare as 2025 grand final due to kick off in Switzerland",
      "Eurovision offers chance to change that. They head to Basel, Switzerland this week, hoping to erase the memories of Olly Alexander and Mae Muller, who both finished at the bottom end of the table.",
      "It helps that Remember Monday's song is a certified banger - full of glittery glam-pop flourishes and sizzling harmonies that (crucially) they can pull off live.",
      "Just before they set off for Euroland, we sat down with the trio to discuss quitting their jobs, overcoming phobias, and the dreaded \"nul points\".",
      "It's eight weeks since you were announced as the UK's Eurovision entry\u2026",
      "Charlotte: No, it can't be. It feels like six years!",
      "How many air miles have you racked up in that time?",
      "Lauren: Honestly, I feel bad about our carbon footprint.",
      "Charlotte: The thing is, I'm a nervous flyer. I always put an eye mask on, put my headphones in and avoid looking out the window. Then we had to catch a propellor plane from Reykjavik in Iceland, and as it was taking off, the whole thing was shaking from side to side.",
      "Lauren: It was really treacherous\u2026 but then, the next Easyjet flight we had to catch, Charlotte was like, 'What a breeze'.",
      "Charlotte: I was smiling, talking. It's like I was cured!",
      "When I first heard What The Hell Just Happened, I thought it sounded like something from Six: The Musical\u2026 Then I discovered you'd actually been in it.",
      "Lauren: That was me! I was Jane Seymour. She's the one that died, instead of being beheaded.",
      "Was it always the plan to put a musical theatre vibe in the song?",
      "Lauren: We wrote a brief for the song and there were so many references: Bohemian Rhapsody, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter.",
      "But we also said 'let's not be afraid to write the pop version of Defying Gravity'. We wanted it to have all that epicness and drama and the West End tricks you don't get in pop music.",

      "Holly-Anne [cringing]: We'd been writing for three weeks and I think we started to go delusional!",
      "That reminds me of something Ed Sheeran says about songwriting: A tap has to run brown before it runs clear.",
      "Charlotte: It's so true, and funnily enough, What The Hell Just Happened was the last song we wrote, a day before the deadline. We'd got to the point where we were like 'let's just go 100% on every idea and see where it lands'.",
      "Holly-Anne: We thought we had the Eurovision Song, I would say, four or five times. Then this one came up and we were like 'OK, it's beaten all of them'.",
      "What can you tell me about your performance?",
      "Holly-Anne: We come from theatre background, so it's definitely going to be theatrical. We want to give that a girl-band, concert feeling, like you're stepping into the world of Remember Monday.",
      "There's a line in the song about ripping your dress. Is that a sneaky Bucks Fizz reference?",
      "Lauren: Oh my God! Let's say yes. We didn't write it specifically with that in mind... but if the shoe fits!",
      "Charlotte: There's loads of little Easter eggs in the lyrics about our friendship. We've had a lot of nights out that ended in a tattoo parlour or losing a shoe somehow.",
      "Do you remember the first time you met?",
      "Holly-Anne: It's impossible to tell because we were in the same sixth form but for the first year we were in different classes.",
      "Lauren: I remember Charlotte coming into my class and singing that song from Parade.",
      "Charlotte [singing]: \"You don't know this maaan.\"",
      "Holly-Anne: Then, in the second year, we all joined the same performing arts class, and we were like 'oh, let's sing together'.",
      "When you graduated you all had full-time jobs \u2013 so how did you keep the band together?",
      "Charlotte: We always had Mondays off\u2026 hence the band name.",
      "Holly-Anne: It was so important to us to keep the band alive that we just never let it die.",
      "Charlotte: At one point, Holly went on tour for a year and we flew out to Singapore so we could be together.",
      "Lauren: Then, maybe 18 months ago, we quit our jobs to do this full-time.",
      "Charlotte: We thought, if we don't throw everything in now, we'll always regret it.",
      "Were your resignation letters like, 'I'm off to be a star!'?",
      "Lauren: Well, Holly and I were in the theatre, so we just didn't renew our contracts, whereas Charlotte was actually a deputy head teacher.",
      "Charlotte: The head was one of my closest friends and a lot of the kids had already seen us at gigs \u2013 so everyone knew it was gonna happen. It was just a matter of time.",
      "Are you prepared for how overwhelming Eurovision week is?",
      "Lauren: Yeah, but we're quite good at immersing ourselves in what we're doing.",
      "Charlotte: Even if there wasn't a bubble around us, the three of us make a bubble. Eurovision is all we talk about, even if we're not together.",
      "Lauren: And then I'm sure from the 18th of May onwards, we'll have a fair amount of downtime.",
      "Holly-Anne: The comedown is going to be rough.",
      "What are your hopes for the result?",
      "Holly-Anne: We do have a preference. And I think the closer we get to it, the more hungry we are for a good result. A placement in the single digits would be nice.",
      "You have loads of festival performances booked for the summer \u2013 so life won't   grind to a halt afterwards.",
      "Lauren: That's so true. And actually, every experience that we're having in the lead-up to May 17, that's Eurovision as well.",
      "Charlotte: All the places we've been to and the people we've met \u2013 it literally feels like a girls' holiday.",
      "Holly-Anne: Even if we get zero points, we'll still be singing together, even if it's in my living room.",
      "What's the one memory you'll take away from this?",
      "Lauren: I will always, always remember the feeling of finding out we'd represent the UK. We've been around for a long time, and we've had a lot of 'noes' as a band, so when we auditioned, we assumed this would be another one. 'Thank you so much, but we're going in another direction'.",
      "So to finally get a yes after all these years, and to start living what feels like a dream come true with your two best friends? I will never forget that phone call.",

    "story": [
      "Two men sit at a bar, drinking Guinness and putting the world to rights.",
      "The setting, though, is not a Dublin pub - but Coventry's Belgrade Theatre, where Roddy Doyle's play Two Pints is part way through its first-ever UK run.",
      "The Irish writer - known for novels including Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha and The Commitments, for which he wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation - uses the play to explore themes of ageing and friendship.",
      "\"They drink, but they're not drinking to drink,\" he said. \"They're drinking for each other's company, really. That's what it's all about.\"",
      "Two Pints was first performed in 2017 in, appropriately, a pub in Dublin, before embarking on a tour of watering holes across Ireland.",
      "Doyle wrote it soon after his father's death.",
      "\"The plot was inspired by the experience of visiting the hospital to see him, and dreading it,\" he explained. \"Wanting to go, but dreading it.",
      "\"So the rhythm of that time \u2013 visiting the hospital, going up for the last time to say goodbye to him, and then the funeral \u2013 is the plot of the play, really.\"",
      "The experience made Doyle reflect on the way men - especially men of a certain age - confide in one another.",
      "\"[I realised that] people, particularly men, will often open up if they're walking side by side rather than facing each other.",
      "\"It struck me that that was like being in a bar.\"",
      "'Respite from anxieties'",
      "While admitting to \"liking a good pub\", Doyle is not trying to make light of the dangers of alcohol abuse.",
      "For Doyle, the pub has a long tradition of bringing people together.",
      "\"When it came to two men of my generation meeting, there was no choice,\" he said. \"It was the pub or nowhere. It was the one place men go.",
      "\"It's respite, isn't it, from life.",
      "\"Respite and withdrawal, from, I suppose, the trickier parts of life, the anxieties.",
      "\"Just for a while.\"",
      "Much has been made on social media of the creative swearing employed by Doyle's barstool philosophers, and, indeed, the Belgrade warns potential audience members of \"some strong language\".",
      "But Doyle insists it is not gratuitous.",
      "\"I examine every word,\" he explained. \"And I try to make sure that is is something that those characters would say. It's part of the rhythm of the speech of working class Dublin people, and a lot of Irish people.",
      "\"I'm not saying it's a good thing or a bad thing, but it is what it is.\"",
      "'It's a universal story'",
      "Like much of Doyle's work, Two Pints focuses on the lives of working-class Irish, told  largely through nothing more than dialogue.",
      "But his hope is that his work - from The Commitments to Two Pints - has an international appeal.",
      "\"Groups of young people coming together to express themselves musically is a universal story, isn't it?\" he said. \"And the same with this one.",
      "\"Men growing older together, and finding comfort in each other's company, is a universal story.\"",

    "story": [
      "The line-up for UK's celebrity edition of The Traitors has finally been revealed - with enough star power to rival Graham Norton's chat show sofa.",
      "The 19-strong roundtable of stars joining Claudia Winkleman at Ardross Castle in Scotland boasts household names across sport and the arts.",
      "Among them are comedians Stephen Fry and Alan Carr, chat show host Jonathan Ross and Olympic diver Tom Daley - all vying to win the game of deception.",
      "Singers Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church will also be there, alongside others including historian David Olusoga, broadcaster Clare Balding, actress Celia Imrie and Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed.",
      "The third series of The Traitors, which aired in January, attracted more than 10 million viewers.",
      "The show's format is deceptively simple. A handful of contestants, known as traitors, pick off their castmates, the faithful, with nightly \"murders\" - while the faithful try to work out their identity. If any traitors remain at the end, they nab the cash prize (though this time the money goes to a charity of the winner's choosing).",
      "The celebrity season, which airs this autumn, will bring a unique mix of fame, ego and public image to the popular format. BBC News speaks to psychologists to uncover likely faithfuls, traitors and frontrunners.",
      "The comedians",
      "Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, Stephen Fry, Joe Wilkinson and Lucy Beaumont",
      "Comedians are likely to be \"the obvious frontrunners to go the distance\", says Susie Masterson, a psychotherapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).",
      "Humour can be a highly adapted defence mechanism, she says, which can make comedians more opaque than other contestants.",
      "Comics are also quick on their feet, used to presenting a persona and masking in public - this makes them well-equipped traitors, notes Masterson.",
      "\"I think Alan Carr could well be a frontrunner,\" she says. \"There is an affability about him, but he's also not afraid of stirring the pot. He's very authentic and has a big personality without necessarily dominating the space.\"",
      "But fame could disadvantage the high-profile names in the group, like Jonathan Ross. Status, explains consultant counselling psychologist Dr Ritika Suk Birah, can create a power imbalance.",
      "\"It can make others feel threatened or suspicious of their motives, even when there's no evidence,\" she says.",
      "This may be a particular challenge for those understood as both intelligent and articulate, like Stephen Fry.",
      "This perception can lead others to assume strategic manipulation, potentially forcing early elimination out of fear rather than logic, adds Dr Birah.",
      "Unfortunately, Masterson also believes Fry could fit into the category of contestants who \"struggle with criticism or scrutiny\".",
      "\"He might struggle with banishing people as well as any potential heat he might receive,\" she says.",
      "The singers",
      "Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church",
      "Stage performers like Cat Burns are used to high-pressure situations, interacting with a variety of people in a live environment. \"This could help at the round table,\" says Masterson.",
      "She adds that Paloma Faith and Charlotte Church are both \"big personalities and have direct communication styles\". While this may make them good motivators, Masterson is unsure whether they can appear contained or measured enough to endure as traitors.",
      "The sports stars",
      "Tom Daley, Joe Marler and Clare Balding",
      "Sports people will likely make good faithfuls, says Masterson, as strong physical types tend to do better in most of the challenges and can also both lead and motivate the rest of the group. They are also usually goal-driven and able to handle pressure.",
      "\"They are quite different personalities in this group, and I'm interested to see how it might play out,\" says Masterson.",
      "\"Clare Balding is very practical and pragmatic, but we have also seen her emotional side on TV recently\".",
      "She feels Tom Daley, and to a lesser extent Balding, could well be \"golden retriever types\" - loyal and supportive - whereas rugby star Joe Marler may be less likely to want to talk things through.",
      "As for the in-built competitive edge, she says success depends on whether they can \"play as a team rather than against each other.\"",
      "The actors",
      "Nick Mohammad, Mark Bonnar, Tameka Empson, Ruth Codd, Celia Imrie",
      "Actors, like comics, may also face distrust depending on how much their castmates expect them to be naturally deceptive.",
      "However, among the group of actors, there is a good mix of ages, types of acting and levels of fame - from soap star Tameka Empson to established film names like Mark Bonnar and Celia Imrie. This could \"balance out this superficial disadvantage\" by muddying the threat level, says Masterson.",
      "She says cast members with lesser-known personalities, like Ruth Codd and Nick Mohammed, might be harder to read.",
      "The media personalities",
      "David Olusoga, Niko Omilana and Kate Garraway",
      "Presenters like Kate Garraway will be used to live interactions, giving them a potential advantage at the roundtable, notes Masterson.",
      "Historian David Olusoga, as a heavyweight intellect, will likely face the same preconception struggle as Fry, she says.",
      "Masterson also adds that quiet people can struggle to go the distance on the show, as they can either be perceived as threatening or unsupportive by the group.",
      "But the show's history has shown this isn't always the case. Last year's contestant Francesca was hardly visible in the first few episodes, even prompting memes about her supposed irrelevancy, before growing into the show and making it to the final.",
      "One dark horse is YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, says author Eloise Skinner, who holds a diploma in psychotherapy.",
      "His career in social media and online content might offer an edge in the game, as someone fluent in an online world that is hyper-aware of perception."

    "summary": "Senior figures in the UK TV industry are contemplating how best to secure its future",
    "story": [
      "Just before Christmas, in a private dining room in the upmarket Charlotte Street Hotel in the heart of London's Fitzrovia area, the BBC's director general gathered some of the UK's leading TV creatives and executives for lunch. As they ate, surrounded by kaleidoscopic-patterned wallpaper and giant artworks, they were also chewing over the future survival of their own industry.",
      "As solutions were thrown around to what many see as an acute funding crisis in the age of global streaming, one of the invitees suggested, in passing, that BBC Studios (the corporation's commercial content-producing arm) could merge with Channel 4 to create a bigger, more powerful force to compete with the likes of Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon.",
      "As another diner knocked down the idea, I'm told that Tim Davie, the BBC's DG, asked why it was so ridiculous.",
      "I relate that not because it has come to fruition. It hasn't. Nor even to suggest that the Director General supports the idea.",
      "Instead the story illustrates the belief, among some within the broadcasting industry, that nothing should be off the table when it comes to contemplating how to ensure the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV as we know it.",
      "Many of the people I spoke to for this piece didn't want to be quoted. But Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former Chairman of ITV, told me that what he termed the current \"generous spread\" of British broadcasters (BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5) will need some consolidation or, at the very least, more cooperation in future.",
      "\"We're in danger of having no public service broadcasting within a decade, certainly within 20 years,\" he says. \"We don't have a strategy for their survival. It's that serious. The regulators need to start thinking about it.",
      "\"Mergers may well be part of the answer. There should be fewer companies in the future.\"",
      "Lord Vaizey, who was Culture Minister under David Cameron, put it baldly. \"ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 should merge.",
      "\"The UK only has room for two domestic broadcasters.\"",
      "Others, however, argue that distinctiveness is good for viewers. Channel 5 President Sarah Rose told me she \"couldn't disagree with Ed Vaizey more\" \u2013 calling it a \"Doomsday prophecy\".",
      "Channel 5 is profitable, she tells me; it invests in smaller production companies and offers plurality for British audiences. By having just one commercial channel, \"You're taking the funnel from three to one types of content for British audiences.\"",
      "Channel 4 also rejects the suggestion of any merger. Its outgoing CEO Alex Mahon argues that, \"The unique structure of competition between our publicly funded and commercially funded broadcasters\" is what makes UK public service TV \"so excellent\".",
      "And yet the days of turning on your TV and finding an electronic programme guide listing channels \u2013 with BBC1 and BBC2 at the top, then ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 \u2013 are disappearing. The proposed date for the dawn of a new era is 2035; the end of traditional terrestrial TV as we know it.",
      "When the increasingly expensive contracts to provide broadcast channels and digital terrestrial services like Freeview come to an end, the UK's broadcasters are likely to pivot to offering digital-only video on demand. (However this won't happen without a campaign to ensure older people are protected, as well as rural and low-income households who may not have high quality internet access.)",
      "But if the aerials are turned off in 2035, is this the moment TV as we know it changes forever? If it becomes a battle between online-only British streamers and their better-funded US rivals, can the Brits survive? And, crucially, what will audiences be watching?",
      "How TV could look by 2035",
      "Flash forward to switching on the television in 2035 and there will of course have been certain technological transformations \u2013 perhaps more immersive viewing experiences or some shows viewed through augmented reality glasses. What's highly likely, though, is that the communal big screen will still be a staple, (albeit probably voice-activated by then).",
      "It's a shift that has already begun with YouTube viewers changing their viewing habits and moving to the bigger screen. In 2024, for the first time, TV sets were the most-used device for watching content on the video sharing site at home, according to recent data from Barb Audiences. In all, 41% of YouTube viewing was done on TV sets, ahead of 31% on smartphones.",
      "With YouTube an apparently unstoppable force, in ten years' time it could well become the go-to viewing for the majority.",
      "\"We are likely to continue to see a shift in the share of viewing time and advertising revenue towards globally-scaled players and user-generated content platforms like YouTube and TikTok,\" all within the next five years, according to Kate Scott-Dawkins, Global President for Business Intelligence at media investment company Group M.",
      "There'll also likely be Netflix, Disney, Apple, Amazon. In other words, the global players, based in the US, many of which also have other revenue streams (whether parks, computer hardware or a vast shopping platform).",
      "Kate Scott-Dawkins tells me the UK broadcasters are facing what could be an \"existential\" battle against US-based media companies with \"wildly different business models\".",
      "The shift to streaming TV has, she says, \"enabled large globally-scaled players to get even bigger and pour money into content that they can put in front of worldwide audiences\".",
      "The \"big players with big pockets\" already pay for a bespoke button on certain remote controls, or their own content tile front and centre on the homepage on smart TVs.",
      "Ms Scott-Dawkins believes that in the future it will be \"a position of strength\" to own the operating systems themselves, as well as the media that people are watching on them. Examples include Apple showing its films and television series on Apple TVs and iPhones, or Amazon showing its own productions via its Fire devices, or Google through its own computers and phones.",
      "Questions of revenue",
      "Part of the problem is that the UK terrestrial channels can't compete financially with the streamers. Netflix, for example, is valued at $472bn (\u00a3356bn).",
      "The BBC has lost 30% of its income \u2013 or \u00a31bn a year \u2013 in real terms since 2010, as the licence fee has become worth less. ITV's share price hasn't yet recovered since the advertising downturn in 2022, despite its vast production arm, ITV Studios, boosting its earnings before tax to \u00a3299m.",
      "Meanwhile, Channel 4's recorded a deficit of \u00a352m for 2023. Alex Mahon told Parliament last month, \"We will pretty much break even in the year\".",
      "Some TV insiders think the solution will be one gateway or app for all public service content: one place to find all shows from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5.",
      "Alex Mahon recently told a newspaper that there needs to be \"more collaboration\" between the UK broadcasters \u2013 a way of \"making sure we're not duplicating the same technology\".",
      "ITV has spent hundreds of millions to create ITVX, its streaming platform for the Netflix-age. Channel 4 took a pioneering approach to its own digital transformation, launching 4oD back in 2006; the first broadcaster in the world to offer television content on-demand.",
      "But while its current \u00a31bn a year revenue enables it to compete as a significant content creator, this may not be enough to sustain a modern distribution platform with all the associated investment costs into the long term, according to some insiders.",
      "Lord Hall, the former BBC Director General, is among those arguing that it's not sustainable for individual broadcasters to continue going it alone. \"The notion that everyone has their own portals when you are competing against the huge streamers is not going to survive into the future,\" he says.",
      "'One big streamer under iPlayer'?",
      "Could the solution be for BBC iPlayer, which has been built with public money, to become the portal for the other British public service media content, too? It would be a single place where viewers could find ITV's The Chase, Channel 4's The Great British Bake Off and Channel 5 News, alongside BBC's The Traitors. This was one idea suggested to me by multiple TV insiders. \"One big streamer under iPlayer\", as one TV executive described it to me, \"a modern public service streaming service\".",
      "Part of their argument is that it's the fastest growing streaming service in the UK \u2013 and the only existing platform of plausible scale to compete.",
      "With political support and the right deal, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 could potentially get behind sharing tech (after all, the streaming service Freely, which launched last year, already hosts their content with the BBC's and others).",
      "But the idea of branding this all under the BBC iPlayer is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 not something that commercial broadcasters would likely entertain, according to conversations I've had.",
      "Lord Hall believes, \"It could be branded differently... It would be a very good step.\"",
      "He says: \"The public would have to get used to the fact that BBC material would be free of advertising, and other parts of the platform would have adverts.\"",
      "If the idea of a shared streaming service sounds familiar, that's because it was proposed years ago. Project Kangaroo was a plan by BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 for a UK video-on-demand joint venture. Think an early rival to Netflix.",
      "But the UK's Competition Commission blocked the project in 2009 because of concerns it could harm competition in the emerging VoD market.",
      "Other regulators across Europe have also blocked mergers: In France, the TFI and M6 channels were prevented from merging. Two of the largest TV and radio broadcasters in the Netherlands, which would have combined eight national TV channels and four national radio stations, were also stopped for competition reasons.",
      "Any form of merger between different public service broadcasters would be subject to the same scrutiny. It's perhaps why Sir Peter Bazalgette is calling on UK politicians and regulators to focus on creating a strategy \u2013 or risk the end of British TV as we know it.",
      "Should the audiences care?",
      "The BBC remains the most watched of the traditional broadcasters. Today, people in the UK spend more time watching traditional broadcasters than they do streaming services. Figures show 87% of people age four and above watch the traditional broadcasters each month and they spend an average of 137 minutes a day doing so. By comparison, 78% of people watch a streaming service and they spend only 40 minutes a day doing so.",
      "If this does shift and the pattern reverses, TV producers and executives may be worried. But does it really matter to audiences?",
      "Netflix is already making the types of shows that may have previously been made by the likes of the BBC (Adolescence, Toxic Town and Baby Reindeer are all very British stories made by the streamer). So what is the problem? (Aside from the obvious point that you need a subscription to watch Netflix.)",
      "Ms Rose argues that the picture is \"much more complex\". Creatives involved in those shows often cut their teeth in public service TV, she says \u2013 one of benefits of the traditional broadcasters is, she believes, that it is a pipeline of talent.",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette argues that they're needed more than ever in our AI age to serve as \"a gold standard of trusted news for our democracy, amid the online Tower of Babel.\"",
      "He also argues for programmes that reflect \"our shared values and national conversation\". Would a US-based streamer have chosen to make Mr Bates v the Post Office (ITV), for example, or 'Wolf Hall' (BBC) or 'It's A Sin' (Channel 4) \u2013 stories that are uniquely British and reflect who we are?",
      "Backing producers to take risks is, says Lord Hall, \"exactly what the BBC should be doing \u2013 but of course [it] has been doing less because the licence fee has been consistently cut\".",
      "Start of the 'martini streaming age'",
      "Ultimately, the American streamers are here to stay; they're spending billions and their UK operations are often led by British executives who are supportive of Britain's public service broadcasting scene.",
      "I have also picked up a sense from those inside Netflix that the company is often used as a battering ram to persuade the government that the UK's traditional broadcasters need more protections.",
      "Some have also been critical of the BBC for, as they see it, wanting everything on its own terms: \"'We want you to give us your money for co-productions, but the BBC will make all the creative decisions',\" is how one insider put it to me, unfairly or not.",
      "In 2018, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was invited to the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. Invitees recall that he talked warmly about how influential the BBC's iPlayer had been to the success of Netflix, describing how impressed he had been by a piece of kit that had got British viewers used to getting their video on demand.",
      "With more than 17 million Brits now subscribed to Netflix, there is a certain irony to that.",
      "Today, as the BBC's Director General Tim Davie starts to position the BBC ahead of the renewal of the corporation's charter after 2027, the TV landscape is changing fast. And the challenges are clear.",
      "Lord Hall tells me: \"Our lives will be enriched by having not only what the streamers can offer, but also what the public service broadcasters can bring. It's unthinkable not to build on what the BBC and others can deliver\".",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette predicts that, \"Small doesn't cut it,\" adding that, \"The winners will have to be big enough to [both] afford high end dramas for winning subscribers and maintain large back catalogues to keep subscribers happy.\"",
      "He says we now live in \"the 'martini' streaming age - any time, any place, anywhere\".",
      "The question is whether the leaders of the public service broadcasters can forge the right plan to safeguard their industry in that age.",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The divides behind the scenes in the Vatican ahead of the conclave",

    "story": [
      "The government ignored an early warning by two Nobel prize-winning scientists that all healthcare workers should be routinely tested for coronavirus in the pandemic, the Covid inquiry has heard.",
      "The advice came in a strongly-worded letter sent in April 2020 by the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute, Sir Paul Nurse, and its research director, Sir Peter Ratcliffe, to the then health secretary Matt Hancock.",
      "NHS and care home staff were not offered Covid tests until November 2020 in England, unless they had symptoms of the disease.",
      "Matt Hancock is due to appear at the inquiry next week, along with other health ministers from the four nations of the UK.",
      "Giving evidence, Sir Paul, who won the Nobel prize for medicine in 2001, said it was \"disturbing\" that he did not receive a response to his concerns until July 2020.",
      "\"For the secretary of state to ignore a letter from two Nobel laureates in physiology or medicine for three months is a little surprising, I would say,\" he told the inquiry.",
      "\"Rather than acknowledge they couldn't do it, because that would have indicated a mistake in their overall strategy, they remained silent.\"",
      "It was likely that the decision not to routinely test NHS and care home staff led to an increase in infections and deaths in the early stages of the pandemic, he added.",
      "Hospitals and care homes",
      "In the first six months of Covid, there was a frantic drive to increase testing for the disease. Matt Hancock set a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April 2020 in England.",
      "By this time it had become clear to scientists across the world that Covid could be spread by people who had not developed symptoms, such as a cough or fever.",
      "Sir Paul Nurse, Sir Peter Ratcliffe and their colleague Dr Sam Barrell wrote to Mr Hancock on 14 April 2020 saying they had \"grave concerns\" about \"asymptomatic transmission\" between healthcare staff and patients.",
      "\"We advise you that all NHS trusts and healthcare providers should be required to set up surveillance systems for the regular testing of all healthcare workers and patients with immediate effect,\" the letter said.",
      "The scientists received a response on 6 July 2020, signed by a junior official in the Department of Health.",
      "That reply did not directly address the subject of healthcare workers, instead stating that testing was a \"key part\" of the government's strategy and that capacity was being \"rapidly expanded\".",
      "Lighthouse labs",
      "The Frances Crick Institute, headquartered in north London, is one of the largest biomedical research centres in the world.",
      "As Covid hit, a team of 300 volunteers started using the organisation's laboratory space and equipment to process Covid tests for dozens of hospitals, GP surgeries and care homes in the local area.",
      "It had the capacity to carry out 4,000 tests a day and to increase that to 10,000 with more funding, according to Prof Nurse.",
      "In March 2020, he wrote to the government offering to help with the national testing effort.",
      "Instead ministers decided to set up a network of giant privately-run Lighthouse laboratories.",
      "In his evidence, Prof Nurse accepted that the larger sites were needed, but said \"insufficient attention\" was paid to universities and other publicly-funded institutions, which could have quickly processed tests for healthcare workers, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic.",
      "The sixth part of the Covid inquiry, which looks at the performance of test, trace and quarantine systems across the UK, runs until the end of May."

      "During the same period, 58 reviews were opened into cases where customers suffered harm - but the MPs said the scale of the failings was likely to be greater.",
      "\"That people continue to face harm after dealing with the DWP is a self-evident failure of safeguarding in the system,\" said committee chair Debbie Abrahams MP.",
      "\"Until recently, getting people back into work to cut costs had been prioritised over providing support and care for vulnerable people,\" Ms Abrahams added.",
      "\"We heard evidence that the process of engaging with the DWP... too often led to mental distress.",

      "'Nasty and traumatic'",
      "Carl, 44, a former roofer from Croydon, south London, said his first interaction with the DWP \"felt quite a nasty and traumatic experience\".",
      "He had struggled for 18 months with a degenerative back condition that had left him with mobility issues and constant pain, requiring strong painkillers.",
      "In 2018, after trying a variety of less manual roles, such as plastering and carpet fitting, he realised he could no longer hold down a job.",
      "He applied for universal credit, his first ever benefit application, which led to an appointment at his local job centre.",
      "Carl says the work coach was \"very dismissive and patronising\".",

      "\"It almost felt like he was trying to imply that I was being dishonest and I was putting it on.",
      "\"It was a very uncaring response. I wanted support to get a non-manual job.\"",
      "'Absolutely life-changing'",
      "Shannon Johnstone, 28, who found herself sleeping rough about seven years ago before turning to the DWP for help, said the recommendations \"are going to be absolutely life-changing for people... if they're done right\".",
      "At the start of her claim, she remembers the DWP told her: \"We can't help with your homelessness,\" which she says was understandable but off-putting.",
      "She does not know if they referred her case to homeless organisations as she was never told. Now she welcomes the recommendation to include the views of people with lived experience in the design, planning and implementation of DWP policy.",
      "\"People who have gone through the system understand what it feels like to be interviewed by a [DWP] inspector,\" says Shannon who now works for the charity, Expert Link.",
      "\"They understand what it's like to gather lots of paperwork, so by including them in the design of the system, it's going to work so much better.\"",

      "Nine out of 10 GPs who said they were against legalising assisted dying worried terminally ill patients would consider it because they felt guilty about being a burden on their loved ones or the health service.",
      "\"The right to die becomes a duty to die for those who feel a burden on family,\" said one GP.",
      "Another common concern was patients might be coerced. Some told us they had treated elderly people with family members they suspected of being more focussed on their inheritance than their relatives.",
      "More than half of the group who opposed a law change said it would be against their religious beliefs.",
      "They spoke about life being \"sacred\" and called assisted dying \"sinful\". Some referred to the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\".",

      "One GP said creating an assisted dying law was \"scandalous\" when hospices were largely funded by charities rather than by the state.",
      "Separately, on Tuesday the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that while the group \"remains neutral\" on the principle of assisted dying, it \"just cannot support this bill\".",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, the college's president Dr Lade Smith cited a lack of requirements concerning the \"unmet needs\" of patients, and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.",
      "\"We're concerned that there isn't a requirement to think about any unmet needs a person might have.

      "Of those who said they were in favour, more than nine in 10 respondents believed it could allow patients to have a dignified death.",
      "Some shared personal experiences: telling us about watching their parents losing dignity or begging to die. One said their sick wife prayed every evening to not wake up in the morning.",
      "Those who backed assisted dying often spoke about patient choice, arguing it was patronising not to let people decide how they wanted to die.",
      "Wanting the option of an assisted death for themselves or their loved ones was another common reason for supporting the law.",

    "story": [
      "The government is abolishing NHS England without a clear plan for how it will be achieved and how it will benefit frontline care, a cross-party group of MPs has warned.",
      "Ministers announced in March that the body responsible for overseeing the health service in England would go, with its functions brought into the Department of Health and Social Care.",
      "But the Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned about the uncertainty being caused and urged the government to set out a clear plan within the next three months.",
      "The government said the move would eliminate \"wasteful duplication\" and that detailed planning had started.",
      "Alongside the changes at a national level, the 42 local health boards responsible for planning services are also having to shed around half of their 25,000 staff.",
      "The MPs also raised concerns about the \"jaw-dropping\" amount of money lawyers are making from clinical negligence claims. Of the \u00a32.8bn paid out in 2023-24, nearly a fifth went on legal costs.",
      "It said this was unacceptable and more must be done to improve safety.",
      "Huge pressure",
      "Committee chair and Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said the changes to NHS England and local health boards amounted to a major structural reform.",
      "He said strong decision-making and experienced staff would be vital to manage a period of \"huge pressure\" for the NHS.",
      "\"It has been two months since the government's decision to remove what, up until now, has been seen as a key piece of machinery, without articulating a clear plan for what comes next \u2013 and the future for patients and staff remains hazy,\" he added.",
      "NHS England, which employs nearly 15,000 staff, is in charge of \u00a3193bn of public sector money this year.",
      "The reduction in staffing of abolishing NHS England is expected to save \u00a3400m, while the cut in local health board staff is expected to add another \u00a3700-750m.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the changes would eliminate \"wasteful duplication\" and a joint board was already working on detailed plans.",
      "\"Serious reform is needed to tackle the challenges facing the NHS,\" she added.",
      "Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts, said the changes \"marked the biggest reshaping of the NHS in a decade\".",
      "He said that while many managers in the NHS understood the need for change, the lack of detail and how the plans fitted in with the forthcoming 10-year plan were \"a cause for concern\" for those running the health service.",

      "Even with staff being brought in from other countries, official estimates show there were 131,000 vacancies in social care in England last year.",
      "Care companies said some services will struggle to survive without international recruits.",
      "\"The sector has been propping itself up with dwindling resources, rising costs, and mounting vacancies,\" said Prof Martin Green of Care England, which describes itself as the largest representative body for independent care providers.",
      "\"Taking (international recruitment) away now with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just short-sighted - it's cruel,\" he said.",
      "Sir Keir said the visa changes were part of a drive \"to reduce immigration significantly\" and that the government wanted to create \"a migration system that is controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "The government said care providers could extend visas for existing staff and recruit migrants already in the UK who have yet to find a job. It also promised a new fair pay agreement for care staff and wanted companies to recruit and train more people from UK.",
      "However, Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said the government was introducing the changes \"in a vacuum\" as a fair pay agreement is a long way off and there is \"no plan to deliver the care workers our country needs.\"",

      "About 1.7 million people work in social care in England, according to Skills for Care, the official body that monitors the workforce.

      "Many care companies said bringing in those staff was the difference between providing services and collapsing. However, there was also abuse of this new route into the UK. For instance, some people were exploited, ending up paying middlemen thousands for travel and sponsorship certificates.",
      "The Home Office says 470 care companies have had their licence to recruit international staff revoked since 2022. It estimates that has led to about 40,000 staff being displaced. Companies say many will have already found alternative care work.",
      "In March 2024, Rishi Sunak's Conservative government tightened the visa requirements. This included saying recruits could no longer bring family with them. It has led to a significant fall in the number of care workers arriving from abroad.",

      "However, in the four years since staff shortages were most acute, relatively little has changed to encourage more UK people to work in care.

      "She said embarrassment about her symptoms as a teenager meant she had struggled to advocate for her condition to be taken seriously.",
      "Prof Julie Cornish, a leading pelvic health doctor, said many patients required surgery for pelvic health problems but that simpler solutions were possible when symptoms were spotted sooner.",
      "'I wouldn't poo if my husband was at home'",
      "Women 'scared to laugh or sneeze' due to incontinence",
      "Ms Nicklas, who works in north Wales, said before her surgery she was \"taking laxatives like they were smarties\" but \"still struggling to go to the toilet\".",
      "\"I was forever living in floaty dresses because of the bloating and even bought maternity jeans just to be comfortable,\" she said.",
      "\"If I was able to go [for a poo] it would only be as a result of irrigation or an enema. I'd come home from work and spend an hour on the toilet \u2013 I had no life, because I was always uncomfortable.\"",
      "She added: \"On one occasion I didn't go to the toilet for four weeks and was admitted to hospital.",
      "\"They said I was so full of poo, everything had just stopped working.\"",
      "Despite various tests and changes to her diet, no cause was ever found, but years of constipation had a long lasting impact on Ms Nicklas' pelvic organs \u2013 causing pain, vaginal bleeding and bloating.",
      "Ms Nicklas' large bowel was removed in 2022.",
      "As an adult, Ms Nicklas said she advocated for her symptoms to be taken seriously, but as a teenager she said embarrassment about bodily functions had made that more difficult.",
      "\"Looking back now, why is that such an embarrassing thing?",
      "\"Why is going to the toilet so embarrassing when it's just a normal function that everybody does?",
      "\"Would my constipation have been better if I hadn't have refused to go to the toilet unless I was at home and my brothers weren't around and no one could hear me? Because that's not healthy decision making,\" she added.",
      "\"As a result of the constipation and so many years of it my body's been affected.",
      "\"Your pelvic floor gets absolutely destroyed by the fact that you're constantly trying to go but you can't go.\"",
      "Prof Cornish, a colorectal surgeon, said pelvic health issues affected both men and women.",
      "\"It is a public health issue that actually we need to be giving information to people at an earlier stage \u2013 and it's not just women and girls, it's also boys and men because pelvic health issues affect everybody in different ways,\" she said.",
      "\"We're not just talking about gynaecological bits, we're talking about the bladder and bowel which can be impacted and that does have a bearing on things like pelvic organ prolapse.",
      "\"So if you are chronically constipated for many years you are far more likely to develop problems with a prolapse.\"",
      "The need for better understanding is part of the reason why Prof Cornish set up the Everywoman health festival in Cardiff, which is now in its third year.",

      "\"If you were to examine most women over 40, 50% of those women will actually have a pelvic organ prolapse, so it's about being able to educate and empower those women to be able to still lead a really normal and well life,\" she said.",
      "Ms Hassan said stigma was a huge factor, which could be worse in some cultures.",
      "\"We know that potentially one in three women will experience some urinary incontinence and potentially one in four women will experience some level of faecal incontinence throughout their life. That's huge numbers \u2013 it's really common.\"",
      "\"Education is key,\" said Prof Cornish.",
      "\"And the difficulty is that whilst there are some people who have that understanding or are able to access that education, you're essentially disenfranchising a large proportion of the population who may not be able to access it, and they may end up being the patients that I see more of.",
      "\"You see the inequalities that are out there.",
      "\"But all of this leads to a massive delay in treatment and usually an increase in the severity of symptoms and treatments needed.",
      "\"We all have a responsibility for our own health and that is going to be key \u2013 it's not just about off-loading it to the NHS, so I think the more we teach our children, that's going to empower them to take responsibility going forward.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 15:05:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The move is among several tweaks to the assisted dying bill which were debated by MPs.",
    "story": [
      "No one would be forced to help with the process of assisted dying against their wishes, under changes approved by MPs.",
      "A bill which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales, expected to die within six months, to seek help to end their own life is currently being considered by Parliament.",
      "The legislation passed its first stage in the House of Commons last November \u2013 but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides.",
      "On Friday MPs debated further potential changes, which also included preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with a patient first.",
      "However, MPs ran out of time to vote on more changes, so further debate and voting will take place on 13 June.",
      "That would be followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill as a whole to its next stage or reject it, either on the same day or a future date.",
      "The government is neutral on the bill and MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line.",
      "The original bill stated that no registered medical practitioner or other health professional would be under any obligation to participate in the process of assisted dying and they could not be discriminated by their employer if they did not wish to do so.",
      "Under a change proposed by Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, and approved by MPs, this has been expanded say no one would have to take part in the process, giving protections to any staff who might be involved.",
      "It specifically mentions social care workers and pharmacists as among those covered.",
      "How could assisted dying laws change across the UK?",
      "Assisted dying law could take four years to implement",
      "MPs scrap judge sign-off in assisted dying bill",
      "During an emotionally charged - and at times ill-tempered - debate, supporters of the bill argued it had been strengthened by earlier changes.",
      "Opening the proceedings, Leadbeater said many people had \"lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances\".",
      "The MP for Spen Valley added: \"Put simply, if we do not vote to change the law, we are essentially saying that the status quo is acceptable.\"",
      "But opponents said the bill had been rushed through and needed stronger protections for people who could be vulnerable to coercion.",
      "Conservative MP Rebecca Paul argued there should be a focus on improving end-of-life care, rather than assisted dying.",
      "\"[The bill] will harm far more people than it will help,\" Paul said.",
      "\"And those people who will be harmed are among the most vulnerable in our communities and I'm not willing to accept this collateral damage.\"",
      "At points the debate became tetchy, with some criticising how the process had been conducted.",
      "Labour MP Jess Asato accused campaigner and broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen of being \"distasteful and disrespectful\" for accusing the bill's opponents of having \"undeclared personal religious beliefs which mean no precautions would satisfy\" their concerns.",
      "However, Dame Esther's daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, told BBC Breakfast she was worried about the \"scaremongering\", \"blatant lies\" and \"myths\" circulating about the bill.",
      "She said that while she appreciated there were concerns over coercion and how the proposed legislation could affect vulnerable or disabled people, the bill was \"full of safeguards\".",
      "Labour former minister Anneliese Dodds was among those to raise fears people could feel under pressure to go through with an assisted death because they do not want to be a \"burden\".",
      "Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier argued doctors should not be allowed to raise the option of assisted dying with patients first.",
      "She told the Commons this \"presents a serious risk that terminally ill patients already highly vulnerable will feel pressured into ending their lives\".",
      "But Conservative MP Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, a former surgeon, said \"highly trained\" medical professionals must be trusted \"to have the difficult and complex conversations that they do every day\".",
      "Several MPs raised concerns people with anorexia could be considered terminally ill and eligible for assisted dying if they refuse to eat or drink.",
      "However, Leadbeater argued this risk was \"negligible\".",
      "\"Not only would someone with severe anorexia be highly unlikely to be assessed to have capacity to make a decision about assisted dying, the other tragic reality is that if a patient was so ill as a result of not eating and drinking for whatever reason, they would die before the process of assisted dying would be able to take place,\" she told MPs.",
      "A proposal from Labour MP Naz Shah would amend the bill so an individual would not meet the requirements for an assisted death \"solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking\".",
      "Leadbeater indicated she would support this but suggested further changes may be needed to make the proposal workable.",
      "Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle by 330 to 275 votes back in November.",
      "Since then, the bill has gone through six months of intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee and several changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off each request for an assisted death. Instead, a panel of experts - including a legal professional, psychiatrist and social worker - would oversee the process.",
      "The issue has split Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides.",
      "Those opposed to assisted dying say the mood has altered among MPs, but so far only a handful have said they have changed their minds since November and it would take dozens to block the bill.",
      "Labour MP Jonathan Hinder is the latest to reveal he will no longer support the bill, saying his concerns have \"deepened\" as it has progressed.",
      "He gave the example of removing the role of a High Court judge as one reason he had changed his mind, adding that more work was needed to make the bill \"practicable and safe\".",
      "If assisted dying does become legal in England and Wales, it would be a historic change for society.",
      "Current laws prevent medics from helping any patient to carry out their wish to die.",
      "On Tuesday, a separate bill to legalise assisted dying in Scotland passed an initial vote.",

    "summary": "The summit between the UK and EU on 19 May will be the first since Brexit - the very idea of it has polarised opinions",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Damian read this article",
      "On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.",
      "It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.",
      "The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and \u2013 for the first time since Brexit \u2013 a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.",
      "The British government believes it's a significant moment.",
      "Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.",
      "Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\".",
      "Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to?",
      "Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?",
      "Questions around a security pact",
      "In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed \u2013 a notable omission, some think.",
      "Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [\u2026] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"",
      "Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.",
      "\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"",
      "The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.",
      "Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.",
      "Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.",
      "\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.",
      "The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".",
      "Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2013 at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.",
      "So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?",
      "No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"",
      "Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.",
      "Delays at the border",
      "More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.",
      "Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.",
      "One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.",
      "\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"",
      "It would also make a big difference for Northern Ireland. After Brexit, special arrangements were put in place to keep the land border it shares with the Republic of Ireland free of new impediments. But at the same time, new paperwork and inspections were put in place on food, drink, animals and plants being transported from mainland Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland. They're bitterly opposed by Unionist politicians and complicate life for many businesses.",
      "But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.",
      "\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.",
      "The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" \u2013 and that this should not now be reversed.",
      "Step change or 'sell out'?",
      "Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.",
      "\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"",
      "But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".",
      "His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.",
      "David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".",
      "\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"",
      "A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".",
      "Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" \u2013 but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.",
      "'Tough it out' on fishing?",
      "After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.",
      "David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.",
      "\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"",
      "So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.",
      "But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.",
      "Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.",
      "Immigration and youth mobility",
      "And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.",
      "For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal \u2013 but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".",
      "It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.",
      "Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.",
      "\"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\".",
      "Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration \u2013 small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.",
      "\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"",
      "Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.",
      "Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious \u2013 and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"",
      "'Making Brexit work'",
      "Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.",
      "\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [\u2026] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"",
      "Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"",
      "But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.",
      "Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\".",
      "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "Back at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park.",
      "In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.",
      "The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here \u2013 perhaps, for just a moment.",

    "story": [
      "Farm inheritance tax changes should be delayed by a year and alternative schemes that will not harm small family businesses need to be properly considered, a committee of MPs has warned.",
      "Government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m at a rate of 20% \u2013 half the usual rate \u2013 saw protests across the UK after they were announced in the Autumn Budget.",
      "In a report released on Friday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee said the changes were made without \"adequate consultation, impact assessment or affordability assessment\".",
      "The government said its inheritance tax reforms were \"vital\" and its commitment to farmers was \"steadfast\".",
      "How are the inheritance tax rules changing?",
      "Efra's report said the tax reforms \"threaten to affect the most vulnerable\" but delaying the implementation of the policy until April 2027 would give those farmers more time to seek \"appropriate professional advice\".",
      "National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Tom Bradshaw said a delay \"doesn't take the terrible pressure off older farmers\".",
      "He said the policy remained \"fundamentally unfit, destructive, badly constructed and must be changed\".",

      "The committee also warned that the government's sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme \"affected trust in the government\" and left many farmers \"at risk of becoming unviable\".",
      "When the SFI scheme, which more than 50,000 farm businesses are signed up to, was closed in March, the NFU described it as another \"shattering blow\" to farmers.",
      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has since announced it will allow SFI applications that were in progress within two months of its closure.",

      "The CLA, which represents 28,000 farmers and rural businesses, urged the government to rethink its \"current disastrous policy\" on inheritance tax.",
      "It said the government should consider an alternative \"clawback\" scheme, under which 100% agricultural and business property reliefs would remain but inheritance tax would be applied to assets if sold within a certain period of time post-death, payable out of the proceeds of the sale.",

      "Downing Street insisted its own deal with Albania was \"never planned as part of the discussions.\"",
      "In short, though, they had failed to ensure the most eye-catching idea they were talking about matched the pictures, the backdrop, the stage they were on.",
      "Cue the Conservatives, whose own record on small boat crossings was poor, but who can point to that specific success with Albania, seizing on Sir Keir's awkward juxtaposition and branding it an \"embarrassment\".",
      "It is another episode that serves as a reminder of just how hard it is finding workable, practical, deliverable solutions to a massive and complex issue, which plenty in government acknowledge they simply have to get a grip of.",

      "The charge has been labelled  \"legal theft of equity\" by campaigner Sonia McColl, who represents an estimated 200,000 park homes residents across England.",

      "Asked why the issue was so important to her, she said: \"Often people need to move into care homes and the loss of 10% of their equity curtails the amount they can afford and that falls back on the local council.",

      "\"Why should the park site owner benefit from work and investment in kitchens and bathrooms in park homes?\" he asked.",
      "\"They already get pitch funds and annual rent, so taking 10% when homes are sold is fundamentally unfair because the park owner doesn't do anything to have this stake in other people's property.\"",

      "\"The commission also helps to ensure that the initial purchase price of park homes and the annual pitch fees remain lower than they would otherwise be.\"",

      "The change would not apply to those who commit a serious further offence \u2013 or are deemed to pose a high risk, she said.",
      "In usual circumstances, these offenders would go in front of a parole board before being confirmed for release, but the government has decided to skip that part of the process, arguing they would have already been released if it was not for a backlog in parole assessments.",
      "The changes are expected to be introduced in the coming weeks.",
      "Mahmood warned that despite plans to start work on three prisons this year, it would not be possible to \"build our way out of this crisis\" and the government otherwise faced running out of spaces for male offenders by November.",

      "\"And that's because there is still [an] outstanding question of why so many people maybe looked the other way, or why this wasn't picked up and given the prominence that was needed, and so that's why justice might technically have been delivered --  But there's still a moment of reckoning to come.\"",

      "\"Whether local authorities, children's services, police officers, all sorts of people you would feel you can trust, and that trust has been fundamentally shaken, if not totally broken, in some of these places,\" she said.",

      "Here is a summary of the key measures.",
      "Work visas tightened - for some",
      "Overseas workers will now generally need a degree-level qualification to apply for the main skilled worker visa, instead of the equivalent of A-level, reversing a change made under Boris Johnson's government.",
      "This higher threshold will not apply to those already in the UK renewing their visa - but ministers say it will prevent new visa applications for around 180 jobs, reducing immigration by around 39,000 a year by 2029.",

      "At the same time, the government wants to expand eligibility for its dedicated work visa for graduates of elite universities outside the UK.",
      "It says a \"targeted and capped\" expansion of the scheme could see the number of qualifying institutions double, from around 40 currently.",
      "The visa for international students who plan to set up a business in the UK will also be reviewed, and ministers say they want to make it easier for \"top scientific and design talent\" to apply for the global talent visa.",
      "Longer residency waits",
      "Immigrants will typically have to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for the right to stay indefinitely \u2013 double the current five-year period.",
      "Under the plans, this period could be reduced through a new \"earned settlement\" system, under which people would be awarded points to reflect their contribution to the UK \"economy and society\".",

      "Ministers say the visa, which was tightened last year, was a key driver of increased immigration in the years after Brexit, and better pay in the sector can solve longstanding recruitment problems.",
      "Visa extensions will be permitted until 2028, and those who already have working rights will be able to switch sponsor during the term of their visa.",
      "Stricter student rules",
      "Overseas graduates will only be able to stay in the UK for 18 months after their studies, instead of two years currently.",
      "Ministers are also thinking of charging English universities a new 6% tax on tuition fee income from international students, which they are promising to reinvest into the higher education and skills system.",

      "Ministers say this will build on a three-year EU-sponsored pilot project that saw around 100 skilled refugees and their families allowed to work in specified sectors such as IT, construction and engineering.",
      "Tougher English tests",
      "Language requirements for all work visas will increase, whilst adult dependents of visa-holders will be required to demonstrate a basic understanding of English to come on a spousal and partner route.",
      "The government says those extending visas will be required to demonstrate a higher level of English when applying to settle in the UK.",
      "Skills and training",
      "The government says firms in sectors deemed to rely too much on overseas workers will be \"expected to comply\" with strategies to boost workplace skills.",
      "These will also be determined by official migration advisers, but government sources say IT, construction and healthcare are likely to feature.",
      "Labour has previously indicated it wants to link skills training to the visa system - but details of what this means in practice have not yet been set out.",

      "BBC Verify examines the measures set out by the government and the challenges ahead.",

      "Migration levels have hit \"unprecedented levels\" in recent years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - reached a record 906,000 in the year ending in June 2023 and then fell to 728,000 in the year ending in June 2024.",
      "The continued high levels persist, despite previous government efforts to bring the numbers down. For example, in 2010 the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to the \"tens of thousands\".",

      "That's according to the central forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances.",
      "That estimate, however, would still be higher than most years in the past decade.",
      "What's been driving immigration?",
      "The vast majority of migrants come to the UK for study or work.",
      "And many of the work visas have been for people coming to do jobs in health and social care.",
      "However, applications for health and social care visas have come down sharply in the past two years after the rules were tightened by the last Conservative government and this decline will ultimately feed into the official net migration statistics in the coming years.",
      "Does immigration help economic growth?",
      "There's been much discussion about the link between immigration and economic growth.",
      "The White Paper - which sets out the government's plan - says the UK economy needs to wean itself off a reliance on cheap overseas labour.",
      "While taking questions from journalists, the prime minister claimed the idea immigration leads to higher economic growth \"doesn't hold\".",
      "Economists do not agree about the exact impact that simply adding more people to an economy has on growth and prosperity.",
      "New arrivals might increase the country's overall level of economic activity - measured by GDP. But on a per-person basis, GDP could be stagnant or falling. Also a larger population puts more pressure on demand for public services and housing.",
      "However, if immigrants are filling important gaps in the labour market which would otherwise not be filled - especially jobs that require specific skills - then economists generally think that immigrants can boost GDP per head and general prosperity.",
      "The OBR says that increased migration generally increases economic growth but \"the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain\".",
      "The OBR's point about growth per person is important because the government has made growth of this measure a key priority.",
      "Growth per person fell in 2023 and was flat in 2024.",
      "What about social care?",
      "There are gaps in our labour market which have been substantially filled by migrants in recent years, most notably social care.",
      "And there were still estimated to be 131,000 vacant posts in adult social care in England in 2023.",
      "Care providers argue stopping them recruiting from overseas will likely make that gap bigger.",
      "Non-immigrants could theoretically fill many of these posts and working-age people who are economically inactive could potentially be deployed in this sector if they could be encouraged and helped into work.",
      "Yet the main barrier to recruitment in social care has been the level of pay, which is currently too low to attract sufficient numbers of British workers.",

      "The government could increase the levels of pay in social care, but that would leave them under pressure to increase grants to local authorities and potentially raise taxes to fund it.",
      "Problems with social care recruitment were also highlighted by Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the Migration Advisory Committee.",
      "\"We've seen widespread reports of exploitation, people coming in who are quite vulnerable earning very low wages.",
      "\"So I am not surprised the government has chosen to close overseas recruitment because it's caused them so much difficulty,\" she said.",
      "What about universities?",
      "Overseas students have been a major contributor to levels of net migration in recent years.",
      "But they are also a significant source of funding for UK universities.",
      "A large reduction in overseas students numbers would undermine the finances of many universities and a number are already in severe financial difficulties.",
      "The government wants to monitor more closely how universities recruit international students.",
      "It is also proposing a limit on the time international students can remain in the UK after graduating. Foreign students would only have 18 months to look for a job, down from 2-3 years previously.",
      "Universities UK - which represents 141 universities - has urged the government \"to think carefully\" about the impact of its measures.",
      "If overseas student numbers did fall, the government could make up the shortfall in universities' revenue by increasing central government grants but, again, that could require an increase in taxes.",
      "Alternatively, it could further increase domestic students' tuition fees, although that would also be contentious.",
      "What about skilled migrants?",
      "The government says it still wants to attract high-skilled individuals \"who play by the rules and contribute to the economy\".",
      "However, the PM also stressed that some parts of the economy are \"addicted\" to importing cheap labour, rather than investing in training UK workers.",
      "As an example, Sir Keir said the number of engineering apprenticeships had fallen in recent years, while visas for overseas workers in this area had gone up.",
      "Figures in the government's new immigration plan show that the number of UK work visas issued for engineering professionals rose from 3,427 in 2021 to 5,495 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the number of new apprenticeships in engineering in England fell from 26,970 in 2021-22 to 18,520 in 2024-25.",
      "But if the government wants many more home-trained engineers that will likely come with a cost in terms of a higher training budget.",
      "While that investment could come partly from firms, it could also mean more public spending and possibly tax rises.",
      "According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, total public spending on adult education and skills has fallen by 24% in real terms since 2010.",
      "Reacting to the government's proposals, Make UK - which represents manufacturers - said firms are being forced to recruit overseas staff because domestic skills training is \"fundamentally flawed\".",

      "And secondly, it is also one of the biggest and most transparent political failings, when you compare rhetoric to reality.",

      "In the 2010s, the Conservatives repeatedly promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands a year, and repeatedly failed.",
      "The numbers then rocketed after Brexit, the very act that meant UK governments were entirely responsible for immigration policy for the first time in a generation.",
      "Most people miss most political debates most of the time, but some are sufficiently totemic they are not just noticed but make the political weather.",

      "It is a longevity of failure that senior politicians of various political persuasions privately accept \u2013 perhaps more so than any other single issue \u2013 has seeded a cynicism and a disillusion with how we are governed.",

      "This is a week of muscular language and intent, firstly primarily on legal migration now, and in a few days on illegal migration too.",

    "story": [
      "Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse \u2013 cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly.",
      "And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour.",
      "They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours.",
      "The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research.",
      "The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.",
      "It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.",
      "Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.",
      "What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.",
      "Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function.",
      "By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene.",
      "Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.",
      "Ginger cats mostly male",
      "For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome.",
      "Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes.",
      "As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger.",
      "In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely.",
      "\"These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,\" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University.",
      "\"As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches.\"",
      "Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki.",
      "He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could \"contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases\".",
      "He and his team raised 10.6m yen (\u00a355,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world.",
      "One contributor wrote: \"We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats.\"",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development.",
      "The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament.",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss.",
      "\"Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,\" said Prof Sasaki.",

      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",
      "Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.",
      "By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies.",
      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",
      "If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.",

      "Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.",
      "Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.",
      "And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.",
      "Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m.",
      "It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.",
      "But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.",

      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "Their research builds on the discovery last year that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate.",
      "The scientists also compiled decades of scientific observations to create a catalogue of the different ways in which chimpanzees use \"forest first aid\".",

      "Lead researcher Elodie Freymann explained there was \"a whole behavioural repertoire that chimpanzees use when they're sick or injured in the wild - to treat themselves and to maintain hygiene\".",
      "\"Some of these include the use of plants that can be found here,\" she explained. \"The chimpanzees dab them on their wounds or chew the plants up, and then apply the chewed material to the open injury.\"",
      "The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body.",
      "They also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals  they weren't related to. This is particularly exciting, explained Dr Freymann, \"because it adds to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy\".",
      "Some of the hundreds of written observations that Dr Freymann and her colleagues studied came from a log book at the field station in the forest site, which is northwest of the capital, Kampala.",
      "This record of anecdotal evidence dates back to the 1990s \u2013 local field staff, researchers and visitors have written in, describing any interesting behaviour they have observed.",

      "There are some surprisingly human-like hygiene habits: One note describes a chimpanzee using leaves to wipe itself after defecating.",
      "This team of researchers has previously identified some of the plants that chimpanzees sought out and ate when they were injured. The scientists took samples of those plants, tested them and discovered most had antibacterial properties.",
      "Chimpanzees are not the only non-human apes with apparent knowledge of plant-based medicine. A recent study showed a wild oranguatan using chewed leaf material to heal a facial wound.",
      "Scientists think studying this wild ape behaviour - and understanding more about the plants the chimps use when they are sick or injured - could help in the search for new medicines.",
      "\"The more we learn about chimpanzee behaviour and intelligence, the more I think we come to understand how little we as humans actually know about the natural world,\" Dr Freymann told BBC News.",
      "\"If I were plopped down here in this forest with no food and no medicine, I doubt that I'd be able to survive very long, especially if I were injured or sick.\"",

      "Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales.",
      "The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions.",
      "The next 2-3 weeks will be \"crucial\" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group.",
      "That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way.",
      "The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt.",
      "Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year.",
      "\"We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,\" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk.",
      "He had to start irrigating his fields in March.",
      "\"We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,\" he said.",

      "The dry and sunny weather this year has led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year.",
      "The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s.",
      "Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation.",
      "That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather.",
      "However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on.",
      "But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does \"potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,\" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.",
      "Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues.",

      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",
      "Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.",

      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",

    "story": [
      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "The UK needs more nuclear energy to power the data centres needed for artificial intelligence (AI), the boss of the world's largest cloud computing company has said.",

      "Matt Garman, chief executive of AWS, told the BBC nuclear is a \"great solution\" to data centres' energy needs as \"an excellent source of zero carbon, 24/7 power\".",
      "AWS is the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world and has funded more than 40 renewable solar and wind farm projects in the UK.",
      "The UK's 500 data centres currently consume 2.5% of all electricity in the UK, while Ireland's 80 hoover up 21% of the country's total power, with those numbers projected to hit 6% and 30% respectively by 2030.",
      "The body that runs the UK's power grid estimates that by 2050 data centres alone will use nearly as much energy as all industrial users consume today.",
      "In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Matt Garman said that future energy needs were central to AWS planning process.",
      "\"It's something we plan many years out,\" he said.",

      "\"Why are data centre providers turning to nuclear? They will need a lot of energy, reliably,\" Mr Chisholm told the BBC.",
      "\"Replication of Hinkley Point C, alongside the roll out of SMRs, can power Britain's digital economy.\"",

      "Jess Ralston at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said: \"Investors can be waiting years for grid connections holding back growth.\"",
      "\"Nuclear could be a way of supply data centre's power needs, but hardly any SMRs have been built anywhere in the world and traditional nuclear remains very expensive and takes a long time to build. So, it may be a while, if ever, for this to be a viable solution\".",

    "story": [
      "Three strong knocks from the police battering ram and the front door bursts open. There's a lot of shouting.",
      "We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail.",
      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",

      "She rejected defence suggestions that her accusations were financially motivated as she wrapped up four days of testimony in the New York criminal trial of her ex-boyfriend.",
      "Ms Ventura, the government's star witness, faced questioning from both legal teams about her decade-long relationship with Mr Combs, and their \"freak off\" sex sessions.",
      "Mr Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He could face life in prison.",

      "The rap mogul's lawyers have been trying to depict Ms Ventura, 38, as an eager participant in the sexual lifestyle.",
      "She testified this week that she was coerced into the sessions, which involved male escorts, because Mr Combs had threatened her with violence.",
      "On Friday she addressed a $20m pay-out he gave her after she filed a lawsuit against him in November 2023.",
      "The settlement, which came just one day after the filing of the legal action, was public knowledge, but the number was previously unknown.",

      "\"I would have agency and autonomy,\" she said.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team also showed the jury dozens of messages between the couple from each stage of their relationship, arguing their dynamic was toxic at times, but not criminal.",
      "Minutes before Ms Ventura was set to leave the stand on Friday, the defence questioned her about another legal settlement she won.",
      "Ms Ventura told the court she was expecting to receive about $10m from InterContinental Hotels, connected to her claims against Mr Combs.",
      "The settlement relates to an incident at the InterContinental in Los Angeles in 2016, in which security footage showed Mr Combs hitting, kicking and dragging her in a hallway.",
      "That clip was played at length in court this week, and is one of the most important pieces of evidence in the trial.",
      "On Friday in court, Ms Ventura went through her texts after that beating. In one message she told Mr Combs: \"I'm not a rag doll. I'm somebody's child.\"",
      "She and Mr Combs were expressing love for each other days later in other texts.",
      "The defence cross-examination continued on all day Thursday and Friday.",

      "One was Dawn Richard, a singer in the group Danity Kane - formed on Diddy's MTV show Making the Band. Last year she filed a lawsuit accusing him of physical abuse and withholding her earnings.",
      "Ms Richard testified that she saw Mr Combs assault Ms Ventura at his Los Angeles mansion in 2009.",

      "Emma works from a tiny office known as the spider milking room. On a typical day, she milks - or extracts the venom from - 80 of these Sydney funnel-web spiders.",
      "On three of the four walls there are floor-to-ceiling shelves stacked full of the arachnids, with a black curtain pulled across to keep them calm.",
      "The remaining wall is actually a window. Through it, a small child stares, both fascinated and horrified, as Ms Teni works. Little do they know that the palm-sized spider she's handling could kill them in a matter of minutes.",
      "\"Sydney funnel-webs are arguably the most deadly spider in the world,\" Emma says matter-of-factly.",
      "Australia is famously full of such deadly animals - and this room at the Australian Reptile Park plays a critical part in a government antivenom programme, which saves lives on a continent where it's often joked that everything wants to kill you.",
      "'Spider girl'",
      "While the quickest recorded death from a Sydney funnel-web spider was a toddler at 13 minutes, the average is closer to 76 minutes - and first aid gives you an even better chance of surviving.",
      "So successful is the antivenom programme here at the Australian Reptile Park that nobody has been killed by one since it started in 1981.",
      "The scheme relies, however, on members of the public either catching the spiders or collecting their egg sacs.",
      "In a van plastered with a giant crocodile sticker, each week Ms Teni's team drives all over Australia's most famous city, picking up Sydney funnel-webs that have been handed in at drop-off points such as local veterinary practices.",
      "There are two reasons why these spiders are so dangerous, she explains: not only is their venom extremely potent, but they also live exclusively in a densely populated region where they're more likely to encounter humans.",
      "Handyman Charlie Simpson is one such person. He moved into his first home with his girlfriend a few months ago, and the keen gardener has already found two Sydney funnel-webs. He took the second spider to the vet, where Ms Teni picked it up shortly after.",
      "\"I had gloves on at the time, but realistically I should have had leather gloves on because their fangs are so big and strong,\" the 26-year-old says.",
      "\"I [just thought] I had better catch it because I kept getting told you're meant to take them back to be milked, because it's so critical.\"",
      "\"This is curing my fear of spiders,\" he jokes.",
      "As Ms Teni offloads one arachnid that was delivered to her in a Vegemite jar, she stresses her team isn't telling Australians to go looking for the spiders and \"throw themselves into danger\".",
      "Rather, they're asking that if someone comes across one, they safely capture it rather than kill it.",
      "\"Saying that this is the world's most deadly spider and then [asking the public to] catch it and bring it to us does sound counter-intuitive,\" she says.",
      "\"[But] that spider there now, thanks to Charlie, will\u2026 effectively save someone's life.\"",
      "All of the spiders her team collects get brought back to the Australian Reptile Park where they are catalogued, sorted by sex and stored.",
      "Any females that get dropped off are considered for a breeding programme, which helps supplement the number of spiders donated by the public.",
      "Meanwhile, the males, which are six to seven times more toxic than the females, are used for the antivenom programme and milked every two weeks, Emma explains.",
      "The pipette she uses to remove the venom from the fangs is attached to a suction hose - crucial for collecting as much venom as possible, since each spider provides only small amounts.",
      "While a few drops is enough to kill, scientists need to milk 200 of these spiders to have enough to fill one vial of antivenom.",
      "A marine biologist by training, Emma never expected to spend her days milking spiders. In fact, she started off working with seals.",
      "But now she wouldn't have it any other way. Emma loves all things arachnid, and goes under various nicknames - spider girl, spider mama, even \"weirdo\", as her daughter calls her.",
      "Friends, family and neighbours rely on her for her knowledge of Australia's creepy crawlies.",
      "\"Some girls arrive home to flowers on their doorstep,\" jokes Emma. \"For me it's not unusual to arrive home to a spider in a jar.\"",
      "The best place to be bitten?",

      "\"They are very uninclined to bite but once they go, you just see it pouring out of the fangs,\" Mr Collett says, as yellow venom drips to the bottom.",
      "\"That is enough to kill all of us in the room five times over - maybe more.\"",
      "Then he switches to a more reassuring tone: \"They're not looking for people to bite. We're too big for them to eat; they don't want to waste their venom on us. They just want to be left alone.\"",
      "\"To get bitten by a venomous snake, you've got to really annoy it, provoke it,\" he adds, noting that bites often occur when someone is trying to kill one of the reptiles.",
      "There's a fridge in the corner of the room where the raw venom Mr Collett is collecting is stored. It's full of vials labelled \"Death Adder\", \"Taipan\", \"Tiger Snake\" and \"Eastern Brown\".",
      "The last of these is the second-most venomous snake in the world, and the one that's most likely to bite you here, in Australia.",
      "This venom gets freeze-dried and sent to CSL Seqirus, a lab in Melbourne, where it's turned into an antidote in a process that can take up to 18 months.",
      "The first step is to produce what's known as hyper-immune plasma. In the case of snakes, controlled doses of the venom are injected into horses, because they are larger animals with a strong immune system.",
      "The venom of Sydney funnel-web spiders goes into rabbits, which are immune to the toxins. The animals are injected with increasing doses to build up their antibodies. In some cases, that step alone can take almost a year.",
      "The animal's supercharged plasma is removed from the blood, and then the antibodies are isolated from the plasma before they're bottled, ready to be administered.",
      "CSL Seqirus makes 7,000 vials a year \u2013 including snake, spider, stonefish and box jellyfish antivenoms - and they are valid for 36 months. The challenge then is to ensure everyone who needs it has supplies.",
      "\"It's an enormous undertaking,\" says Dr Jules Bayliss, who leads the antivenom development team at CSL Seqirus.",
      "\"First and foremost we want to see them in major rural and remote areas that these creatures are likely to be in.\"",
      "Vials are distributed depending on the species in each area. Taipans, for example, are in northern parts of Australia, so there's no need for their antivenom in Tasmania.",
      "Antivenom is also given to the Royal Flying Doctors, who access some of the nation's most remote communities, as well as Australian navy and cargo ships for sailors at risk of sea snake bites.",
      "Papua New Guinea also receives about 600 vials a year. The country was once connected to Australia by a land bridge, and shares many of the same snake species, so the Australian government gives the antivenom for free \u2013 snake diplomacy, if you like.",
      "\"To be honest, we probably have the most impact in Papua New Guinea, more so than Australia, because of the number of snake bites and deaths they have,\" says CSL Seqirus executive Chris Larkin. To date, they reckon they've saved 2,000 lives.",
      "Back at the park, Mr Collett jokes about the nickname of \"danger noodles\" that is sometimes given to his serpentine colleagues \u2013 a classic Australian trait of making light of something that gives so many visitors nightmares.",
      "Mr Collett, though, is clear: these animals should not put people off from visiting.",
      "\"Snakes aren't just cruising down the streets attacking Brits - it doesn't work like that,\" he jokes.",
      "\"If you're going to get bitten by a snake, Australia's the best place \u2013 we've got the best antivenom. It's free. The treatment is unreal.\"",

    "summary": "The secretary of state's comments come as Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 114 people, according to hospitals and rescuers",
    "story": [
      "The top US diplomat Marco Rubio has said the US is \"troubled\" by the humanitarian situation in Gaza.",
      "His comments came as at least 114 Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes on Thursday, health officials said.",
      "Asked by the BBC if the Trump administration remained fully behind the nature of Israel's military action given the scale of the recent Israeli attacks and its bombing of hospitals, he once again called on Hamas to surrender and release hostages and said there could be no peace so long as the group exists.",
      "\"That said, we're not immune or in any way insensitive to the suffering of the people of Gaza, and I know that there's opportunities here to provide aid for them,\" he said.",
      "Gaza has been under a complete Israeli blockade of all food and other humanitarian supplies for 10 weeks. Israeli forces have been intensifying their bombardment of what they say are Hamas fighters and infrastructure ahead of a planned expansion of their ground offensive in Gaza.",
      "Rubio's comments - made after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Turkey - appeared to be a reference to a controversial Israeli-American proposal to use private providers to set up aid collection points in Gaza. That plan has been rejected by the UN as unethical and unworkable.",
      "They come as Donald Trump is visiting the region and indirect negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel continue.",
      "Hamas meanwhile accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of \"undermin[ing] mediation efforts by deliberate military escalation\".",
      "An Israeli government spokesman said Israel wanted negotiations on hostage releases to succeed, but that they would take place while Hamas was under \"military pressure\".",
      "The US is Israel's main arms supplier and the language used by Rubio is unusual. Previously he has responded to questions about Palestinian civilian casualties only by calling on Hamas to surrender. It also comes amid recent reports of a rift between Trump and Netanyahu.",

      "In southern Gaza the streets of Khan Younis were filled with funeral processions and grieving families on Thursday morning, following what residents said were the deadliest set of air strikes in the city since Israel resumed its offensive almost two months ago.",
      "Some 56 people, including women and children, were killed when homes and tents sheltering displaced families were bombed overnight in the city, the local Nasser hospital said.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in southern Gaza.",
      "One man told BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme that Nasser hospital's mortuary was \"filled beyond capacity\", and that several bodies had to be placed in the corridor before they could be buried.",
      "Doctors were forced to treat wounded people, including those with burns, amputations and internal bleeding, on stretchers, benches and on the floor due to a lack of beds, he said.",
      "\"Among those killed today were 36 children... Entire families have been wiped from the civil registry,\" he added. \"Tragically, this level of destruction has become part of daily life.\"",
      "One video shared by a local activist showed medics laying dozens of bodies on the ground at a local cemetery. An imam stood nearby leading prayers for hundreds of mourners gathered behind him in orderly rows.",
      "Safaa al-Bayouk, a 42-year-old mother of six, said her sons Muath, who was six weeks old, and Moataz, who was one year and four months, were killed in one of the strikes.",
      "\"I gave them dinner and they went to sleep. It was a normal day... [then] the world turned upside down,\" she told Reuters news agency.",
      "Reem al-Zanaty, 13, said her uncle's family, including her 12-year-old cousin Menna, were killed when their two homes were bombed.",
      "\"We didn't feel or hear anything until we woke up with rubble on us,\" she said. \"The Civil Defence did not come. I will tell you honestly we pulled ourselves [out]. My father helped us.\"",
      "Medics said local journalist Hassan Samour, who worked for Hamas-run al-Aqsa Radio, was killed along with 11 members of his family when their home in the eastern Bani Suheila neighbourhood was struck.",
      "In northern Gaza, the Civil Defence agency said its first responders had recovered the bodies of four people following Israeli strikes in the northern town of Beit Lahia and two others in the central town of Deir al-Balah.",
      "Later, spokesman Mahmoud Basal reported that an Israeli strike on a home in Jabalia town had killed all five members of the Shihab family.",
      "Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that 15 people were killed, including 11 children, when the al-Tawbah health clinic and prayer hall in the al-Fakhouri area of Jabalia refugee camp was bombed.",
      "A graphic video posted online purportedly from the scene showed two bodies covered in debris on a street next to a badly damaged building.",
      "\"An indescribable crime, in all meanings of the word. They were safe in a medical clinic, civilians, children, women, men, something a person can't fathom, for them to release a military missile on a medical clinic, on people and passers-by,\" resident Yehya Abu Jalhoum told Reuters.",
      "Amir Selha, a 43-year-old resident of northern Gaza, told AFP news agency: \"Tank shells are striking around the clock, and the area is packed with people and tents.\"",
      "He also said Israeli military drones had dropped leaflets over his neighbourhood warning residents to move south.",
      "The military said it had struck 130 \"terror targets\" throughout Gaza over the past two days, including cells of fighters, rocket launchers and infrastructure sites.",
      "On Wednesday, Israeli strikes killed at least 80 people across the territory, including 59 in Jabalia town and refugee camp, according to hospitals and the Civil Defence.",
      "The military said it struck Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in the north on Tuesday night. It had warned residents of Jabalia and neighbouring areas to evacuate on Tuesday after rockets were launched into Israel.",
      "Israeli evacuation orders issued on Wednesday afternoon also caused panic among residents of a crowded area of Gaza City, in the north.",
      "The Israeli military said a hospital, a university and several schools sheltering displaced people in the Rimal neighbourhood had become \"terrorist strongholds\" and that it would soon attack them with \"intense force\".",
      "Separately, a US-backed organisation said it would start work in Gaza within two weeks as part of a new and heavily criticised US-Israeli aid distribution plan.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said it had asked Israel to let the UN and others resume deliveries until it was set up, and also to allow it to set up aid distribution sites in the north as well as the south.",
      "Israel's UN envoy, Danny Danon, said he was \"not familiar with those requests\", but he confirmed that the \"major operation\" would start very soon.",
      "UN spokesperson Farhan Haq meanwhile reiterated that it would not participate in the plan, saying it \"does not accord with out basic principles, including those of impartiality, neutrality [and] independence\".",
      "Israel has not allowed any aid or other supplies into Gaza for 10 weeks, and an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has warned that half a million people face starvation.",
      "Israel imposed the blockade on 2 March and resumed its offensive against Hamas two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire. It said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining 58 hostages, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza's population. Israel has said it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of food.",
      "Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "At least 53,010 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,876 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

    "story": [
      "A 1,000 year-old human skeleton which was buried sitting cross-legged in India has been moved to a museum six years after it was excavated.",
      "The BBC had reported earlier this month that the skeleton had been left inside an unprotected tarpaulin shelter close to the excavation site in western Gujarat state since 2019 because of bureaucratic wrangling.",
      "On Thursday, the skeleton was shifted to a local museum, just a few miles away from where it was unearthed.",
      "Authorities say that it will be placed on display for the public after administrative procedures are completed.",
      "Mahendra Surela, curator of the Archaeological Experiential Museum in Vadnagar where the skeleton has now been shifted, told the BBC that the skeleton was transported with \"utmost care\" and under the supervision of several experts.",
      "He added that officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) - the agency responsible for preservation of archaeological research - will examine the skeleton before taking a decision on where and how the skeleton should be displayed in the museum.",
      "It is currently placed next to the reception and is fenced in by a protective barrier.",
      "\"It is likely that we may shift it to the second floor, where a photograph of the skeleton is already placed,\" Mr Surela said.",
      "Archaeologist Abhijit Ambekar, who discovered the skeleton, said that he was happy that the significant find was getting the attention it deserved.",
      "Ambekar had earlier told the BBC that the skeleton was a rare discovery as similar remains had been found at only three other sites in India.",
      "But as officials argued over who should take charge of the skeleton, it remained in a make-shift tent close to the excavation site, unprotected by security guards and exposed to natural elements.",
      "Experts say that the skeleton likely belongs to the Solanki period. The Solanki dynasty, also known as the Chaulukya dynasty, ruled over parts of modern-day Gujarat between 940 to 1300 CE.",
      "The skeleton had managed to survive the passage of time because the soil around it had remained undisturbed and displayed characteristics that aided preservation.",
      "Mr Ambekar said that the remains could shed light on the phenomenon of \"samadhi burials\" - an ancient burial practice among Hindus where revered figures were buried rather than cremated."

    "story": [
      "Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest.",
      "When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. \"My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before.\" Again they ran. \"I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out.\" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered.",
      "A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes.",
      "\"When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,\" said MN Sudhan, 72. \"Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot.\"",
      "\"Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,\" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. \"Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.\"",
      "Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence.",
      "The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attack killed 26 people - mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack.",
      "What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink.",
      "Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated.",
      "In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success.",
      "\"The strikes\u2026 were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,\" an Indian government source told the BBC. \"We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line.\"",
      "But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani government said it was expecting an attack.",
      "\"We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,\" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload.",
      "Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on.",
      "\"We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,\" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources.",
      "But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. \"Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle.\"",
      "It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure.",
      "A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move.",
      "India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left.",
      "But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked.",
      "\"I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,\" Hafeeza said.",
      "Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries.",
      "\"A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood\u2026 We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way.\"",
      "Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed.",
      "Sanam, who lost her mother, said: \"I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes.\"",
      "Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible.",
      "\"The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out.\"",
      "After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a \"clear sense in\u2026 power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready.",
      "\"We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems.\"",
      "On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes.",
      "US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be \"none of our business\".",
      "This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, \"it was clear the US didn't want to get involved\".",

      "Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC.",
      "The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard.",
      "\"I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming.",
      "\"That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could.\"",
      "One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions.",
      "\"There were six or seven of us packed into it,\" she said. \"The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,\" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black.",
      "Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 23:01:32 GMT",
    "summary": "After seven breathless days of diplomatic hurly burly, we have a clearer idea of the US president's global ideology - and the limits of his 'art of a deal'.",
    "story": [
      "\"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.\" So supposedly said the Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The diplomatic whirlwind that has surrounded US President Donald Trump this week suggests the old Bolshevik might have been onto something.",
      "For the protectionist president, who promises always to put America First, has in recent days instead been busy bestriding the world stage.",
      "He and his team have done business deals in the Gulf; lifted sanctions on Syria; negotiated the release of a US citizen held by Hamas; ended military strikes on Houthi fighters in Yemen; slashed American tariffs on China; ordered Ukraine to hold talks with Russia in Turkey; continued quiet negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal; and even claimed responsibility for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan...",
      "The pace has been breathless, leaving allies and opponents alike struggling to catch up as the US diplomatic bandwagon hurtled from issue to issue.",
      "\"Just, wow!\" remarked one London-based ambassador. \"It is almost impossible to stay on top of everything that's going on.\"",
      "So what is going on? What have we learned in this frantic week about the US president's emerging foreign policy? Is there something approaching a Trump doctrine - or is this just a coincidental confluence of global events?",
      "Pomp and flattery in Saudi",
      "A good place to start, perhaps, is the president's visit to the Gulf where he set out - in word and deed - his vision for a world of interstate relations based on trade, not war. In a speech in Riyadh, Trump said he wanted \"commerce not chaos\" in the Middle East, a region that \"exports technology not terrorism\".",
      "His was a prospect of a breezy, pragmatic mercantilism where nations did business deals to their mutual benefit, a world where profit can bring peace.",
      "As he enjoyed the flattery of his Saudi hosts and the obeisance of visiting dignitaries, the president signed - with his fat felt tip pen - deals that the White House claimed represented $600bn of investment in the US.",
      "This was Trump in all his pomp; applauded and rewarded with immediate wins he could sell back home as good for American jobs.",
      "Some diplomats privately questioned the value of the various memorandums of understanding. But the show, they said, was more important than the substance.",
      "A 'none of our business' approach",
      "Absent from Trump's speech was any mention of possible collective action by the US and other countries; no talk of multilateral cooperation against the threat of climate change, no concerns about challenges to democratic or human rights in the region. This was a discourse almost entirely without reference to ideology or values except to dismiss their significance.",
      "Rather, he used his speech to Saudi leaders to make his clearest argument yet against Western interventionism of the past, attacking what he called \"the so-called nation-builders and neo-cons\" for \"giving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs\".",
      "To the applause of his Arab audience, he said these \"Western interventionists\" had \"wrecked more nations than they built\", adding: \"Far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use US policy to dispense justice for their sins.",
      "\"I believe it's God's job to sit in judgement. My job is to defend America.\"",
      "That reluctance to intervene was on show in recent days when it came to the fighting between India and Pakistan. In the past, the US has often played a key role seeking to end military confrontations in the subcontinent. But the Trump White House was initially cautious about getting involved.",
      "Vice-President JD Vance told Fox News the fighting was \"fundamentally none of our business\u2026 We can't control these countries\".",
      "In the end, both he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio did make calls, putting pressure on both nuclear powers to de-escalate. So too did other countries.",
      "When the ceasefire was agreed, Trump claimed US diplomacy had brokered the deal. But that was flatly dismissed by Indian diplomats who insisted it was a bilateral truce.",
      "Pros of policy in one man's hands",
      "The centrality of Trump to US foreign policy has also become apparent this week. This is more than just a simple truism. On show was the lack of involvement of other parts of the US government that traditionally help shape US decision-making overseas.",
      "Take the president's extraordinary decision to meet Syria's new president and former jihadist, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and lift sanctions on Syria. This showed the potential advantage of having foreign policy in one man's hands: it was a decisive and bold step. And it was clearly the president's personal decision, after heavy lobbying by both Turkey and Saudi Arabia.",
      "It was seen by some diplomats as the quid pro quo for the diplomatic fawning and investment deals Trump received in Riyadh. Not only did the decision surprise many in the region but it also surprised many in the American government.",
      "Diplomats said the State Department was reluctant to lift sanctions, wanting to keep some leverage over the new Syrian government, fearful it was not doing enough to protect minorities and tackle foreign fighters.",
      "Diplomats say this pattern of impulsive decision-making without wider internal government discussion is common in the White House. The result, they say, is not always positive.",
      "This is due, in part, to Trump's lack of consistency (or put simply, changing his mind).",
      "Take the decision this week to do a deal with China to cut tariffs on trade with the US. A few weeks ago Trump imposed 145% tariffs on Beijing, with blood thirsty warnings against retaliation. The Chinese retaliated, the markets plunged, American businesses warned of dire consequences.",
      "So in Geneva, US officials climbed down and most tariffs against China were cut to 30%, supposedly in return for some increased US access to Chinese markets. This followed a now-familiar pattern: issue maximalist demands, threaten worse, negotiate, climb down and declare victory.",
      "Limitations of his 'art of a deal'",
      "The problem is that this \"art of a deal\" strategy might work on easily reversible decisions such as tariffs. It is harder to apply to longer term diplomatic conundrums such as war.",
      "Take Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On this, Trump's policy has been fluid, to put it mildly. And this week was a case in point.",
      "Last Saturday the leaders of the UK, France, Poland and Germany visited Kyiv to put on a show of support for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. And in a group call with Trump on French President Emmanuel Macron's phone, they spelled out their strategy of demanding Russia agree an immediate 30-day ceasefire or face tougher sanctions.",
      "This was Trump's policy too. The day before he wrote on social media: \"If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions.\" But then on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin suggested instead there should be direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey on Thursday. Trump immediately went along with this, backtracking on the strategy he had agreed with European leaders a day earlier.",
      "\"Ukraine should agree to (these talks) immediately,\" he wrote on social media. \"I am starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin.\"",
      "Then on Thursday, Trump changed his position again, saying a deal could be done only if he and Putin were to meet in person.",
      "This puzzles some diplomats. \"Does he genuinely not know what he wants to do about the war in Ukraine?\" one remarked to me. \"Or does he just grasp at what might offer the quickest resolution possible?\"",
      "A snub to Netanyahu?",
      "Into this puzzling mix fell two other decisions this week. First, Trump agreed a ceasefire after a campaign bombing Houthi fighters in Yemen for almost two months. There have been questions about the effectiveness of the hugely expensive air strikes, and the president's appetite for a long military operation. He repeatedly told his Arab hosts how much he disliked war.",
      "Second, Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, held his fourth round of talks with Iran over efforts to curb their nuclear ambitions. Both sides are hinting that a deal is possible, although sceptics fear it could be quite modest. Talk of joint US-Israeli military action against Iran seems to have dissipated.",
      "What unites both issues is that the United States was acting directly against the wishes of Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu may have been the first world leader invited to the Oval Office after Trump's inauguration, but in recent days, he seems to have been snubbed. Trump toured the Middle East without visiting Israel; he lifted sanctions on Syria without Israel's support. His Houthi ceasefire came only days after the group attacked Tel Aviv airport.",
      "Diplomats fear Netanyahu's reaction. Could the spurned prime minister respond with a more aggressive military operation in Gaza?",
      "Capitalism to overcome conflict",
      "So after this week of diplomatic hurly burly, how much has changed? Perhaps less than might appear.",
      "For all the glitz of Trump's tour through the Middle East, the fighting and humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues unresolved. A fresh Israeli offensive seems imminent. One of Trump's chief aims \u2013 the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - remains distant.",
      "For all the talks about ending the war in Ukraine, there is no greater likelihood of the guns falling silent. Putin's ambitions seem unchanged. And for all the deals to cut US tariffs, either with the UK or China, there is still huge global market instability.",
      "We do have a clearer idea of Trump's global ideology, one that is not isolationist but mercantilist, hoping optimistically that capitalism can overcome conflict. We also have a clearer idea of his haste, his desire to clear his diplomatic decks \u2013 in the Middle East, Ukraine and the subcontinent \u2013 so he can focus on his primary concern, namely China.",
      "But that may prove an elusive ambition.\u202fIf there are weeks when decades happen, there are also weeks when nothing happens.",

    "story": [
      "Tucked away in a lane in the southern end of India's financial capital, Mumbai, is a  museum dedicated to the followers of one of the world's oldest religions, Zoroastrianism.",
      "The Framji Dadabhoy Alpaiwalla Museum documents the history and legacy of the ancient Parsi community - a small ethnic group that's fast dwindling and resides largely in India.",
      "Now estimated at just 50,000 to 60,000, the Parsis are believed to be descendants of Persians who fled religious persecution by Islamic rulers centuries ago.",
      "Despite their significant contributions to India's economic and cultural fabric, much about the Parsi community remains little known to the mainstream population and the wider world.",
      "\"The newly-renovated museum hopes to shake off some of this obscurity by inviting people to explore the history, culture and traditions of the Parsi community through the rare historical artefacts on display,\" says Kerman Fatakia, curator of the museum.",
      "Some of these include cuneiform bricks, terracotta pots, coins and other objects sourced from places like Babylon, Mesopotamia, Susa and Iran and are dated to 4000-5000 BCE.",
      "These are places where Zoroastrian Iranian kings once ruled, like the Achaemenian, Parthian and Sasanian dynasties.",
      "There are also artefacts from Yazd, a city in central Iran which was once a barren desert and the place where many Zoroastrians settled after fleeing other regions of Iran after the Arab invasion in 7th Century BCE.",
      "One of the notable artefacts on display is a replica of a clay cylinder of Cyrus the Great, a Persian king who was the founder of the Achaemenid empire.",
      "Fatakia says the clay cylinder - also known as the \"Edict of Cyrus\" or the \"Cyrus Cylinder\" - is one of the most important discoveries of the ancient world. Inscribed in cuneiform script, it outlines the rights granted by Cyrus to his subjects in Babylon. Widely seen as the first human rights charter, a replica is also displayed at the United Nations.",
      "Then there are maps that trace the migration routes of thousands of Iranian Zoroastrians who fled their home country fearing persecution and travelled to India in the 8th to10th centuries, and again in the 19th century.",
      "The collection also features furniture, manuscripts, paintings, and portraits of prominent Parsis - among them Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, founder of the iconic Tata Group, which owns brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley tea.",
      "Another striking section showcases artefacts collected by Parsis who grew wealthy in the early 19th century trading tea, silk, cotton - and notably, opium - with China. The exhibits include traditional Parsi sarees influenced by designs from China, France, and other regions shaped by these global trade ties.",
      "Two of the museum's most compelling exhibits are replicas of a Tower of Silence and a Parsi fire temple.",
      "The Tower of Silence, or dakhma, is where Parsis leave their dead to be returned to nature - neither buried nor cremated. \"The replica shows exactly what happens to the body once it's placed there,\" says Fatakia, noting that entry to actual towers is restricted to a select few.",
      "The life-size replica of the fire temple is equally fascinating, offering a rare glimpse into a sacred space typically off-limits to non-Parsis. Modelled on a prominent Mumbai temple, it features sacred motifs inspired by ancient Persian architecture in Iran.",
      "The Alpaiwala Museum, originally founded in 1952 in what was then Bombay, is one of the city's older institutions. Recently renovated, it now features modern displays with well-captioned exhibits in glass cases. Every visitor is offered a guided tour.",
      "\"It's a small museum but it is packed with history,\" Fatakia says.",
      "\"And it's a great place for not just the residents of Mumbai or India to learn more about the Parsi community but for people from all over the world.\""

      "In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed \u2013 a notable omission, some think.",
      "Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [\u2026] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"",
      "Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.",
      "\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"",
      "The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.",
      "Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.",
      "Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.",
      "\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.",
      "The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".",
      "Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2013 at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.",
      "So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?",
      "No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"",
      "Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.",
      "Delays at the border",
      "More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.",
      "Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.",
      "One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.",
      "\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"",
      "It would also make a big difference for Northern Ireland. After Brexit, special arrangements were put in place to keep the land border it shares with the Republic of Ireland free of new impediments. But at the same time, new paperwork and inspections were put in place on food, drink, animals and plants being transported from mainland Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland. They're bitterly opposed by Unionist politicians and complicate life for many businesses.",
      "But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.",
      "\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.",
      "The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" \u2013 and that this should not now be reversed.",
      "Step change or 'sell out'?",
      "Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.",
      "\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"",
      "But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".",
      "His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.",
      "David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".",
      "\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"",
      "A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".",
      "Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" \u2013 but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.",
      "'Tough it out' on fishing?",
      "After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.",
      "David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.",
      "\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"",
      "So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.",
      "But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.",
      "Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.",
      "Immigration and youth mobility",
      "And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.",
      "For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal \u2013 but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".",
      "It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.",
      "Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.",
      "\"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\".",
      "Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration \u2013 small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.",
      "\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"",
      "Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.",
      "Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious \u2013 and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"",
      "'Making Brexit work'",
      "Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.",
      "\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [\u2026] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"",
      "Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"",
      "But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.",
      "Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\".",
      "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "Back at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park.",
      "In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.",
      "The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here \u2013 perhaps, for just a moment.",

      "His new home - for now - is a budget hotel near an American highway.",
      "He and dozens of other white South Africans were moved to the US under President Donald Trump's controversial policy to protect them from the discrimination he alleges they are facing - an accusation that South Africa rejects.",
      "Mr Kleinhaus defends the US president, telling the BBC he left his homeland after receiving death threats in WhatsApp messages.",
      "\"I had to leave a five-bedroom house, which I will lose now,\" Mr Kleinhaus tells the BBC, adding that he also left behind his car, his dogs and even his mother. \"I didn't come here for fun,\" he adds.",
      "The contrast in homes couldn't be more stark. But for Mr Kleinhaus, his situation in Buffalo, New York, is already a better one. \"My children are safe,\" says Mr Kleinhaus, whose wife died in a road accident in 2006.",
      "The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.",
      "Trump and his close ally, South Africa-born billionaire Elon Musk, have even argued that there has been a \"genocide\" of white farmers in South Africa - a claim that has been widely discredited.",
      "In February, Trump signed an executive order granting refugee status to Afrikaners, such as Mr Kleinhaus, who he said were being persecuted.",
      "Mr Kleinhaus is one of a group of 59 who arrived on Tuesday at Dulles airport, near Washington DC, after Trump's administration fast-tracked their applications.",
      "He admits he was surprised at how quickly he got to the US, and that he is grateful to Trump. \"I felt finally somebody in this world is seeing what's going on,\" he says.",
      "As he and his family arrived with others at the airport they were greeted with red, white and blue balloons. He describes the pomp and ceremony as \"overwhelming\".",

      "Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?",
      "Afrikaners are a white ethnic minority who ran South Africa during the apartheid era, implementing racist policies of segregation in the country until the regime was officially abolished in 1994.",
      "But more than 30 years on, black farmers own only a small fraction of the country's best farmland, with the majority still in white hands.",
      "That has led to anger over the slow pace of change. Mr Kleinhaus acknowledges that black South Africans have suffered as well as him.",
      "But he says: \"I had nothing to do with apartheid. Nothing, nothing, nothing.\"",
      "In January, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately owned land without compensation - in certain circumstances, when it is deemed \"equitable and in the public interest\".",
      "The South African government says no land has yet been seized. But Mr Kleinhaus says once there is a government claim on your land - as he says is the case with his - it becomes impossible to function.",
      "\"Your land becomes worthless - the land expropriation has gone too far,\" he says. \"People are scared of that. Other Afrikaners who criticise us live in a bubble.\"",
      "Some fellow Afrikaners have described Mr Kleinhaus and the group as opportunists, and that being a victim of crime is not equivalent to the type of persecution that deserves refugee status.",
      "Mr Kleinhaus acknowledges that the murder rate of farmers is low in South Africa, but says he does not want to be a victim. \"There are people in my area who were shot and killed,\" he says.",
      "He says he received threats from members of the local community: \"I'd regularly get messages on WhatsApp saying, 'we'll get rid of you, you're on my land'.\"",
      "Mr Kleinhaus says he received one message before he left for the US which read: \"We are coming for you, you better be awake.\"",

      "\"As South Africans, we are resilient,\" he said earlier this week. \"We don't run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems.\"",
      "What makes the resettlement of the Afrikaners to the US particularly controversial is that other refugees have been banned, including Afghans who earlier this week had their Temporary Protected Status removed.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that move was justified because the security and economic situation in Afghanistan had improved - despite criticism from opposition lawmakers and rights groups.",
      "Mr Kleinhaus says he is sympathetic: \"I mean, I feel sorry for the Afghans that they can't get here. But I know there's a process there. And I know when and if you are approved for the process, they take care of you.\"",
      "Does he worry he's being used as a political pawn by Trump? And that another president could potentially reverse this decision in four years' time?",
      "Mr Kleinhaus pauses, and says: \"Yeah, it is scary, but I am a religious person. Just to be in this first group is an act of God, I believe, because there was a 0.0 something percent chance that you were selected for the first call.\"",
      "Questions over refugees' vetting",
      "Mr Kleinhaus has come under scrutiny for antisemitic posts on social media, which have since been deleted.",
      "Discussing one of these, he says he copied and pasted someone else's thoughts, and  that he was being administered morphine as part of medical treatment at the time - though he admits this was not an excuse.",
      "The 2023 post was made in a moment of anger, he adds, after he saw a video - not verified by the BBC - which purported to show some Jews spitting at Christians in Israel.",
      "Mr Kleinhaus insists the comments were specific to one moment, and not a wider comment about Jewish people. \"Even now, if I see any person going against my religion, I will speak up against it,\" he said.",
      "The US government is facing questions about the vetting process for those being resettled. The UN's refugee agency told the BBC it was not involved in the screening process for the Afrikaners as it normally would be for refugees heading to the US.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has previously stated it is screening immigrants' social media activity for antisemitism, and using it as a reason for denying applicants.",

      "Since returning to office, Trump has launched a crackdown to reduce immigration more broadly. So, is Mr Kleinhaus concerned about any backlash to his group being offered entry to the US?",
      "\"People must not think we are just taking advantage of this,\" he says. \"We come here to make a contribution to the country.",
      "\"I'm not worried it'll fall apart because I believe this is God's plan for me.",

      "A mixture of Dutch (34.8%), German (33.7%) and French (13.2%) settlers, they formed a \"unique cultural group\" which identified itself \"completely with African soil\", South African History Online noted.",

      "In 1948, South Africa's Afrikaner-led government introduced apartheid, or apartness, taking racial segregation to a more extreme level.",
      "This included laws which banned marriages across racial lines, reserved many skilled and semi-skilled jobs for white people, and forced black people to live in what were called townships and homelands.",
      "They were also denied a decent education, with Afrikaner leader Hendrik Verwoerd infamously remarking in the 1950s that \"blacks should never be shown the greener pastures of education. They should know their station in life is to be hewers of wood and drawers of water\".",

    "title": "How India and Pakistan share one of the world's most dangerous borders",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmj7l0lne3o",
    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 23:32:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Living along the LoC - the volatile India-Pakistan border - means life in a fragile limbo between war and peace.",
    "story": [
      "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.",
      "The recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.",
      "\"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.",
      "\"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.",
      "India and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement.",
      "The LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation.",
      "Ceasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)",
      "The LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\".",
      "Such wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank.",
      "Not surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.",
      "\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.",
      "Violence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.",
      "The 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.",
      "Between 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025.",
      "\"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.",
      "It's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.",
      "Tensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.",
      "\"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.",
      "Mr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.",
      "\"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.",
      "Mr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.",
      "He argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics.",
      "The hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.",
      "Some experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.",
      "\"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.",
      "\"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\"",
      "In his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\"",
      "\"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Between 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.",
      "Today, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.",
      "\"You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,\" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.",
      "It was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield.",
      "How real is the risk of nuclear war between India and Pakistan?",

    "summary": "Prosecutors say they are treating the killing of 23-year-old Valeria Marquez as a femicide.",
    "story": [
      "When a 23-year-old Mexican influencer was shot dead while live streaming on TikTok, rumours began to swirl. Was it a cartel hit? Or another tragic example of violence against women?",
      "On Tuesday, Valeria Marquez was shot dead at Blossom The Beauty Lounge, a beauty salon owned by the victim in Zapopan, a town in the central-eastern state of Jalisco.",
      "The state prosecutor's office said it is investigating the crime as a femicide, meaning that it believes the crime was motivated by the fact the victim was a woman.",
      "The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said an investigation is under way: \"We're working to catch those responsible and find out why this happened.\"",
      "But the fact that the crime took place in Jalisco, the state where the feared Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG) emerged, led to speculation by some that the cartel may somehow be involved.",
      "A rising star",
      "Ms Marquez was a Mexican model who began to make a name for herself in 2021 after winning the Miss Rostro (Miss Face) beauty pageant, according to Mexican media reports.",
      "Shortly thereafter, she began creating content on social media. She would share makeup tips and personal care routines, talk about fashion and show off her travels.",
      "Photos of her on private jets and yachts can be seen on her Instagram account, which had more than 223,000 followers at the time of her death.",
      "Ms Marquez also had another 100,000 followers on TikTok.",
      "Although it is unclear exactly what happened, during her final livestream, Ms Marquez said she was waiting for a courier she knew to deliver a gift.",
      "She added that she was a bit worried, because her friend could not see the courier's face when he arrived.",
      "\"Why didn't he just drop it off (the gift)? Were they going to pick me up (kidnap me) or what?\" she wondered aloud to her followers.",
      "While holding a pink stuffed animal, Ms Marquez looked away from the camera and immediately grabbed her chest and belly before collapsing into her chair.",
      "Another woman then took the phone and ended the livestream.",
      "Police arrived at the scene around 18:30 local time (12:30 GMT) and confirmed Ms Marquez's death, according to the state prosecutor.",
      "Authorities say that at least two men on motorcycles arrived at the salon and one of them asked the victim if she was Valeria. When she replied \"yes,\" he pulled out a gun and shot her at least twice before fleeing.",

      "But the salon's location in the wealthy Zapopan area of Guadalajara has raised questions about the motive for the crime. While the presence of private security and the tidyness of its streets give the impression that Zapopan is a safe area, in reality it is one of the most violent municipalities in Jalisco. In fact, shootings regularly occur in the area's luxurious shopping centres.",
      "More than half of the real estate and commercial development in the area is connected to the laundering of drug trafficking money, according to the US Department of Justice.",
      "Jalisco ranks sixth among Mexico's 32 states, including Mexico City, in terms of homicides, with 906 murders registered since the beginning of President Claudia Sheinbaum's term in October 2024, according to data consulting firm TResearch.",
      "It is also one of the Mexican states most affected by the cartels. It was here, 50 kilometres from Zapopan, that a cartel training centre was found in March, and it is here that 15,000 people have disappeared since 2018.",
      "The same day that M\u00e1rquez was killed, a former congressman named Luis Armando C\u00f3rdoba D\u00edaz was murdered just two kilometres away, according to the newspaper Reforma.",
      "According to the state of Jalisco, as many as 90% of crimes are never reported or investigated. The state attorney's office has also long been accused of having links to cartels, which it denies.",
      "The prosecutor's office said that so far they have no reason to suspect that Ms Marquez's murder was ordered or carried out by any of the organised criminal groups operating in the area.",
      "Instead, the office suggested the murderer may have been motivated to kill her because of her gender.",
      "Mexican media outlets had previously published messages in which Ms Marquez blamed her ex-partner if anything happened to her.",
      "Mayor of Zapopan Juan Jos\u00e9 Frangie said his office had no record of Ms Marquez requesting help from the authorities due to threats against her, adding \"a femicide is the worst thing\", according to news agency AFP.",
      "\"In response to claims pointing to alleged perpetrators of the femicide in Zapopan, we clarify that there are no direct accusations against any individual in the investigation file,\" the Jalisco prosecutor's office said in a statement.",
      "\"All statements and clues, including videos and social media posts, are being analysed. The investigation is being conducted under the femicide protocol, with a gender perspective, without revictimisation and in accordance with the principles of legality, impartiality and respect for human rights,\" it added.",

      "Yurii, 37, used to work in a technology company before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \"They (Russia and Ukraine) have to start talking. Us soldiers, we wish this war would end. But it's important to remember that we cannot stop it because we did not start it,\" he says.",
      "He looks up at the screen and spots Russian soldiers moving again. He and his colleagues calculate the co-ordinates of their positions and pass them on to their artillery unit.",
      "We drive from the command centre to the artillery position, on mud tracks running through a wide expanse of open fields. Clumps of mud fly in the air, our car slips and slides, as we move as fast as possible. The speed is a mitigation against strikes from drones, which have sharply increased fatalities for both Russia and Ukraine since they were deployed in large numbers in 2023.",
      "And war technology keeps evolving. Now there's a new threat \u2013 drones equipped with a real fibre optic cable which unrolls as they fly. \"We cannot detect them or neutralise them, so there are probably a lot more drones in the area right now than we know,\" says Yurii.",
      "As we drive into the artillery position hidden under trees and bushes, soldiers are already loading the gun. It's a French made self-propelled artillery gun called the \"Caesar\". Scores have been deployed in Ukraine since the start of the war, and France has been trying to ramp up production.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by its accuracy, and we can use a large range of ammunition. The most important thing is that bringing it into combat is very fast. It is much more effective than the old Soviet equipment I've used,\" says Kozak.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers fire four rounds, each one emitting a deafening sound. From around us, we also hear the sound of incoming shells. The battle rages on.",
      "\"As you can hear, there is a wave of assaults from the enemy and we need a lot of ammunition to suppress that. We hope our international partners can give us as much ammunition as possible, because if we have to start choosing priority and non-priority targets then the enemy will be successful,\" says Kozak.",
      "We ask the soldiers how they feel about suggestions that Ukraine will have to make concessions, that it might have to give up land to secure peace.",
      "\"It's painful to hear that. Even I want to go home to my family. My daughter is eight and I miss her so much. But we need to be strong. I don't believe that if we give up some territory, they will stop. In a couple of years, they will return and start over,\" says Yurii.",
      "\"A person who has not come here, who hasn't felt the consequences of Russian aggression, those armchair commentators say you can give up land and everything will be over. They will never understand how many brothers and friends we have lost. We shouldn't give up a single metre of our land,\" says Kozak.",
      "The cost Ukraine has paid to defend its land is visible everywhere, most acutely in the photos of smiling, young soldiers posted by the side of highways, on memorial walls in central city squares, and on rows and rows of freshly dug graves in the country.",
      "Yana Melnikova lovingly buys her son's favourite treats - a cup of steaming hot chocolate and a chocolate roll.",
      "Then she drives out to a cemetery in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, and places them neatly by 22-year-old Vladislav's grave. She and her daughter, 13-year-old Nicole, wipe the grave with wet tissues. Before long, they break down inconsolably into each other's arms.",
      "Vladislav was a drone operator with the Ukrainian military. He was killed in combat in a Russian strike on 21 February this year.",
      "For Yana, news of direct talks resuming bring no hope.",
      "\"It seems to me that this war is eternal. Of course, I hope they will find a solution. Because people are dying here and there (in Russia). But Putin is greedy. His hunger for our land is insatiable,\" says Yana.",
      "Parts of the Zaporizhzhia region are currently occupied by Russia, the front line less than 40 miles from the city. But Russia has on more than one occasion demanded control of the full regions of Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, Donetsk and Kherson as part of any peace deal.",
      "\"No way. I want to live in Ukraine, not Russia. We have seen what they do under occupation, what they did in places like Bucha \u2013 their cruelty and torture,\" says Yana. \"Can you imagine, they've not even spared this graveyard,\" she adds, pointing to a big crater nearby where a bomb exploded some months ago.",

      "Israel is preparing a series of sites in Gaza that could be used as distribution centres for humanitarian aid in a controversial new plan, satellite images show.",
      "The Israeli government suspended food and medicine deliveries into Gaza in March.",
      "Ministers said the move, which has been condemned by UN, European and Middle Eastern leaders, was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining hostages. Israel also accused Hamas of stealing aid \u2013 an allegation the group has denied.",
      "The UN has said the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicines and fuel, and an assessment on Monday warned that Gaza's population of around 2.1 million people was at \"critical risk\" of famine.",
      "The US confirmed last week that it was preparing a new system for providing aid from a series of hubs inside Gaza, which would be run by private companies and protected by security contractors and Israeli forces.",
      "Images analysed by BBC Verify show that land has already been cleared, with new roads and staging areas constructed at a number of locations in southern and central Gaza in recent weeks.",
      "Israel has not publicly said where the hubs will be, but humanitarian sources - briefed previously by Israeli officials - told BBC Verify that at least four centres will be built in the southern section of Gaza and one further north near the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land controlled by the military that effectively divides the territory.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - an organisation set up to support the plan - initially said food, water and hygiene kits would be supplied to 1.2 million people, less than 60% of the population.",
      "On Wednesday it announced it would start operations before the end of May, and appeared to call for Israel to allow aid through normal channels until its distribution centres were fully operational. It also called for aid hubs to be built in northern Gaza, something not envisaged under the original plan and which had led to criticism that people would be forced to move south.",
      "UN agencies have insisted they will not co-operate with the plan - which is in line with one previously approved by Israel's government - saying it contradicted fundamental humanitarian principles.",
      "A spokesperson for the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of seeking to use \"food and fuel as leverage, as part of a military strategy\".",
      "\"All aid would be channelled through a handful of militarised hubs,\" Olga Cherevko told BBC Verify.",
      "\"That kind of arrangement would cut off vast areas of Gaza \u2013 particularly the most vulnerable, who can't move easily, or are otherwise marginalised \u2013 from any help at all.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Bushra Khalidi of Oxfam described the new plan as a \"farce\".",
      "\"No logistical solution is going to address Israel's strategy of forcible displacement and using starvation as a weapon of war. Lift the siege, open the crossings and let us do our job.\"",
      "It is understood that the proposed new system has not yet had final sign-off from the Israeli government.",
      "'Secure distribution sites'",
      "BBC Verify used satellite imagery to identify four potential sites based on the limited available information about their locations.",
      "The sites are similar in size, shape and design to existing open-air distribution sites inside Gaza, such as at Erez, Erez West and Kisufim. The largest site we've looked at is bigger - more comparable to the area inside Gaza at Kerem Shalom crossing.",
      "Our analysis of the imagery shows significant development at one of the sites in south-west Gaza, close to the ruins of a village that is now an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) base.",
      "Satellite photos since early April show the construction of a road there and a large staging area, surrounded by berms - large defensive barriers made of piled sand or earth - about 650m (2,130ft) from the border with Egypt.",
      "A high-resolution image captured on 8 May shows bulldozers and excavators working on a section of land spanning about 20 acres (8 hectares). IDF armoured vehicles are at a fortified building nearby.",
      "A photo taken on site, geolocated by BBC Verify, also shows lighting being installed on the perimeter.",
      "Further imagery from 11 and 12 May shows this, along with three other sites, continuing to expand. One site is about half a kilometre from a collection of eight UN warehouses, and 280m from another large warehouse.",
      "Stu Ray - a senior imagery analyst with McKenzie Intelligence - agreed the sites were likely to be secure distribution centres. He noted that some of the facilities are in \"close proximity to IDF Forward Operating Bases which ties in with the IDF wishing to have some control over the sites\".",
      "Analysts with another intelligence firm, Maiar, said the facilities appeared to be designed with separate entrances for trucks to move in and out, and with other gaps in the berms that would be suitable for pedestrian entrances.",
      "The IDF did not comment on the potential aid centres when approached by BBC Verify, but said that its operations in Gaza were carried out \"in accordance with international law\".  Cogat - the Israeli body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza - did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Three of the four sites located by BBC Verify are south of the IDF's newly created Morag Corridor.",
      "What is the Morag Corridor?",
      "This is an Israeli military zone that runs across the Gaza Strip and separates the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah.",
      "Since the IDF established a security zone there in early April, a six-mile (10km) road has been built covering two thirds of the width of Gaza, bordered by defensive berms and dotted with IDF outposts.",
      "This new road leads directly to one of the development sites visible in satellite imagery, and a pre-existing road connects it to two more.",
      "This entire area has been subjected to extensive land clearance by the IDF. BBC Verify has geolocated video and images of areas throughout the Morag Corridor, and south of it, filmed by Israeli forces, which show controlled demolitions using explosives and heavy machinery, and extensive destruction of buildings.",
      "Humanitarian sources said Israeli briefings indicated that aid would enter Gaza via Kerem Shalom crossing.",
      "Satellite imagery shows ongoing construction work happening there too over the past few months, with the apparent expansion of its storage areas, and new roads added.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v5r1erdpgo",
    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 23:48:46 GMT",
    "summary": "As one of 25 member groups on the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.",
      "Despite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.",
      "It also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future.",
      "In a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.",
      "Delhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".",
      "The IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.",
      "Even Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.",
      "\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.",
      "But addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.",
      "India's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".",
      "As one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.",
      "Unlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.",
      "For example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain \u2013 and the decisions are made by consensus on the board.",
      "\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.",
      "Addressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.",
      "In their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.",
      "Furthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.",
      "\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.",
      "If India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani.",
      "The FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.",
      "\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"",
      "As things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.",
      "Separately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.",
      "Such reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.",
      "Mr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.",
      "He points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.",

      "The US president, and his South-Africa born ally Elon Musk, says that white Afrikaners are being persecuted in their home country, and that they are being subjected to a \"genocide\".",
      "This is a claim that has been circulating for many years even though it has been widely discredited.",
      "Although some white farmers have been attacked and killed, South Africa has one of the world's highest murder rates, so this is an issue that affects all of its citizens, whatever their race.",
      "\"For me, South Africa is home. It's a place where my roots and heritage are, where I can contribute to the story of our nation and make a meaningful impact,\" said Mr Janse van Vuuren, who has more than one million followers on social media.",

      "Thirty years after the end of the racist system of apartheid, average living standards among South Africa's white community remain far higher than for the black majority.",
      "Mr Janse van Vuuren said that the debate about the status of Afrikaners in South Africa had only served to make him \"more determined than ever to step up and contribute to South Africa in every way I can\".",
      "Four centuries after the first group of Dutch settlers arrived in what is now South Africa, most Afrikaners regard themselves as fully African \u2013 as seen in the name \u2013 and no longer identify with their European roots.",
      "But many are unhappy both with the high crime rate and the government's policies aimed at reducing economic inequality in the country \u2013 especially a law passed earlier this year that allowed the government to seize land without compensation \"when it is just and equitable and in the public interest\". White South Africans are 7% of the country's population, but own half of its farmland.",
      "Some Afrikaners are farmers and see the law as being aimed at them.",
      "Trump said the legislation prompted him to offer to help resettle \"Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination\".",
      "The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.",
      "But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture.",
      "South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.",
      "On Monday, the first group of 59 Afrikaners granted refugee status arrived at the Dulles airport near Washington DC after choosing to leave their home country.",
      "The arrival of the group drew dismay and outrage across South Africa, as the country's civil society and leadership sought to dispel the claims that the white minority was being persecuted.",
      "\"They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution,\" said South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "He later labelled their move a \"cowardly act\" as he addressed farmers at a convention held in the Free State province.",
      "The president's sentiments were echoed by many South Africans, including Mr Janse van Vuuren, who is proud of his Afrikaner origins.",
      "While he was not raised in a farming family, he has relatives and friends in agriculture who have been victims of crime.",
      "He said that while it was undeniable that some farmers faced \"genuine threats and hardships\", it was important to be cautious \"when discussing claims of persecution or discrimination that portray an entire group as victims of targeted violence or systemic oppression\".",
      "While many white South Africans echo Mr Janse van Vuuren's sentiments, there are also those who see themselves as a persecuted minority.",
      "Among them is Ilse Steenkamp, who along with her family, has applied for the programme but has not received feedback. She did not want us to use her real name.",
      "Ms Steenkamp, 47, and her husband, both Afrikaners, were commercial farmers but said they had lost their land recently after it was invaded by people who \"took over the whole farm\" just as they were about to sell it in order to \"downscale\".",
      "She said they had bought the land two decades ago, after the end of apartheid.",
      "The people who invaded destroyed critical infrastructure, making it impossible to sell, she said.",
      "Despite efforts to have them removed through the courts, Ms Steenkamp said they were forced to abandon the land as it was repossessed by the bank.",
      "Ms Steenkamp said that while she and her family were familiar with South Africa's high crime levels and often tried to \"not let it get us under\", this latest attack \"was the straw that broke the camel's back\".",
      "Even though her family were eager to embrace Trump's offer when it was first announced, the mother-of-three told the BBC that the decision to leave \"was very difficult because you're... leaving a whole way of life\".",
      "Asked whether it was unfair that Afrikaners were being granted refugee status at a time when the US was cracking down on refugees and asylum seekers from everywhere else in the world, Ms Steenkamp said she \"completely disagreed\".",
      "She pointed to assaults on farmers, saying there was a \"hatred that seems to go with these attacks\".",
      "\"Any farmer that has gone through that [kind of] attack and is now wanting to flee, I think should be treated as a refugee because they are fleeing from a government that will not even admit that these things are happening,\" she said.",

      "While you're at home watching the introductory videos known as postcards, dozens of people swarm the stage, setting the scene for whatever comes next.",
      "\"We call it the Formula 1 tyre change,\" says Richard van Rouwendaal, the affable  Dutch stage manager who makes it all work.",
      "\"Each person in the crew can only do one thing. You run on stage with one light bulb or one prop. You always walk on the same line. If you go off course, you will hit somebody.",
      "\"It's a bit like ice skating.\"",
      "The stage crew start rehearsing their \"F1 tyre change\" weeks before the contestants even arrive.",
      "Every country sends detailed plans of their staging, and Eurovision hires stand-ins to play the acts (in Liverpool 2023, it was pupils from the local performing arts school), while stagehands start shaving precious seconds off the changeovers.",
      "\"We have about two weeks,\" says Van Rouwendaal, who's normally based in Utrecht but is in Basel for this year's contest.",
      "\"My company is around 13 Dutchies and 30 local guys and girls, who rock it in Switzerland.",
      "\"In those two weeks, I have to figure out who's right for each job. Someone's good at running, someone's good at lifting, someone's good at organising the backstage area. It is a bit like being good at Tetris because you have to line everything up in a small space, in the perfect way.\"",
      "As soon as a song finishes, the team are ready to roll.",
      "As well as the stagehands, there are people responsible for positioning lights and setting pyrotechnics; and 10 cleaners who sweep the stage with mops and vacuum cleaners between every performance.",
      "\"My cleaners are just as important as the stage crew. You need a clean stage for the dancers  - but also, if there's an overhead shot of somebody lying down, you don't want to see shoeprints on the floor.\"",
      "The attention to detail is clinical. Backstage, every performer has their own microphone stand, set to the correct height and angle, to make sure every  performance is camera perfect.",
      "\"Sometimes the delegation will say the artist wants to wear a different shoe for the grand final,\" says Van Rouwendaal. \"But if that happens, the mic stand is at the wrong height, so we've got a problem!\"",
      "Spontaneously changing footwear isn't the worst problem he's faced, though. At the 2022 contest in Turin, the stage was 10m (33ft) higher than the backstage area.",
      "As a result, they were pushing heavy stage props \u2013 including a mechanical bull \u2013 up a steep ramp between every act.",
      "\"We were exhausted every night,\" he recalls. \"This year is better. We've even got an extra backstage tent where we prepare the props.\"",
      "Props are a huge part of Eurovision. The tradition started at the second ever contest in 1957, when Germany's Margot Hielscher sang part of her song Telefon, Telefon into (you guessed it) a telephone.",
      "Over the intervening decades, the staging has become ever more elaborate. In 2014, Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk trapped one of her dancers in a giant hamster wheel, while Romania brought a literal cannon to their performance in 2017.",

      "\"Backstage, the props that have been used are pushed back to the back of the queue, and so on. It's all in the planning.\"",

      "In other words, Richard ducked onto the stage, guitar in hand, while the director cut to a wide shot, concealing his presence from viewers at home.",
      "\"It's choreographed to the nearest millimetre,\" he says. \"We're not invisible, but we have to be invisible.\"",
      "What if it all goes wrong?",
      "There are certain tricks the audience will never notice, Van Rouwendaal reveals.",
      "If he announces \"stage not clear\" into his headset, the director can buy time by showing an extended shot of the audience.",

      "Her performance was briefly interrupted when the feed from an on-stage camera froze, but producers simply cut to a wide shot until it was fixed. (If it had happened in the final, she'd have been offered the chance to perform again.)",
      "\"There's actually lots of measures that are being taken to make sure that every act can be shown in the best way,\" says Reist.",
      "\"There are people who know the regulations by heart, who have been playing through what could happen and what we would do in various different situations.",
      "\"I'll be sitting next to our head of production, and if there's [a situation] where somebody has to run, maybe that's going to be me!\"",
      "It's no surprise to learn that staging a live three-hour broadcast with thousands of moving parts is incredibly stressful.",
      "This year, organisers have introduced measures to protect the welfare of contestants and crew, including closed-door rehearsals, longer breaks between shows, and the creation of a \"disconnected zone\" where cameras are banned.",
      "Even so, Reist says she has worked every weekend for the past two months, while Van Rouwendaal and his team are regularly pulling 20-hour days.",
      "The shifts are so long that, back in 2008, Eurovision production legend Ola Melzig  built a bunker under the stage, complete with a sofa, a \"sadly underused\" PS3 and two (yes, two) espresso machines.",
      "\"I don't have hidden luxuries like Ola. I'm not at that level yet!\" laughs Van Rouwendaal",
      "\"But backstage, I've got a spot with my crew. We've got stroopwafels there and, last week, it was King's Day in Holland, so I baked pancakes for everyone.",
      "\"I try to make it fun. Sometimes we go out and have a drink and cheer because we had a great day.",
      "\"Yes, we have to be on top, and we have to be sharp as a knife, but having fun together is also very important.\"",

      "In 1989, brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents by shooting them multiple times at close range at their mansion in Beverly Hills.",
      "They were found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.",
      "However, in a resentencing hearing in Los Angeles a judge reduced their term, making them eligible for parole.",
      "Public interest in the case has grown since a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, was released in September.",
      "Why was there a hearing to resentence the brothers?",
      "In 2024, the previous district attorney of Los Angeles, George Gasc\u00f3n, requested that the brothers' sentence of life without the possibility of parole be changed to 50 years to life.",
      "The issue was put to Los Angeles County superior court Judge Michael Jesic on 13 May, who agreed.",
      "\"I do believe they've done enough in the past 35 years that they should get that chance,\" he said, concluding a day-long hearing.",
      "Menendez sentences reduced, given them chance of freedom",
      "Menendez sentences reduced, given them chance of freedom",
      "The brothers are now eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law which allows individuals who committed crimes before the age of 26 to seek a reduced sentence.",
      "The siblings were aged 18 and 21 at the time. They are now aged 54 and 57.",
      "What happened at the resentencing hearing?",
      "During the hearing, family members and a former fellow inmate were among those who testified in support of the resentencing.",
      "People who worked with the brothers in prison spoke about the educational courses they had completed, and described a hospice initiative they created for the elderly and sick.",
      "The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes a lower sentence, said the brothers have continued to \"make excuses\" for their conduct instead of taking full responsibility and were not rehabilitated.",
      "The brothers spoke to the court via video and apologised for their actions.",
      "They also expressed their hope to work with sex abuse victims and help those incarcerated if they were given a second chance outside prison.",
      "Three possible paths to freedom: What's next for the Menendez brothers?",
      "Menendez brothers feel 'hope' for parole after decades in jail",
      "Who decides whether the Menendez brothers will be released?",
      "The California parole board will now decide whether to release the brothers from prison.",
      "Separately, the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, is considering a request from the brothers for clemency. If approved, it could lead to a reduced sentence or a pardon.",
      "Governor Newsom requested that the parole board conduct a risk assessment that examines whether the brothers pose a risk to the general public if released.",
      "The full report has not been released, but the district attorney said it indicated a \"moderate risk of violence\".",
      "The parole board hearing on the clemency petition is set to take place on 13 June.",
      "It is unclear whether the board will also consider the possibility of parole based on Judge Jesic's resentencing at the same hearing.",
      "What did the Menendez brothers do?",
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, on 20 August 1989 at their home in Beverly Hills.",
      "Their father, a 45-year-old Hollywood executive, was shot six times with a shotgun the brothers had purchased days before the attack.",
      "Their mother died after suffering 10 shotgun blasts to several parts of her body.",
      "The brothers initially told police they found their parents dead when they arrived home.",
      "They were arrested after the girlfriend of a psychologist that had been treating Erik Menendez went to police to say that he had physically threatened the doctor.",
      "Why did the Menendez brothers kill their parents?",
      "The brothers claimed they committed the murders in self defence after years of alleged physical, emotional and sexual abuse, although no molestation was ever proven in court.",
      "They said they feared their father would kill them after they threatened to expose him.",
      "However, prosecutors argued that the young men had killed their successful parents to inherit their multi-million-dollar estate.",
      "What happened during the original Menendez trials?",
      "The brothers were taken into custody in 1990, and in 1993 they were tried for the murders, first individually, with one jury for each brother.",
      "However, both juries were deadlocked in 1994, resulting in a mistrial, and the pair were later tried again together in 1995.",
      "During their joint trial the judge excluded apparent evidence of abuse from their defence case. Taped sessions with a doctor, in which the killings were discussed, were ruled admissible in court by the judge.",
      "A jury found them guilty and the pair were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996.",
      "The brothers, who were separated during their detention after a detective who investigated the slayings said they may conspire to escape if housed together, reunited in jail in 2018.",
      "What impact has the Netflix drama had on the case?",
      "The case was thrust back into the spotlight after Netflix released a drama series about the brothers in September 2024.",
      "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, shot to the top of the platform's streaming chart and was reported to have had more than 12 million views in the first weekend after release alone.",
      "The programme explores what might have led the siblings to kill their parents and presents the murders from different perspectives.",
      "Its creators said the series was based on extensive research.",
      "It includes the brothers' claims of abuse as well as showing things from the parents' point of view.",
      "The show introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released.",
      "The series was a follow-up to the controversial first Monsters series about US serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.",
      "What have the Menendez brothers said about the Netflix series?",
      "Following its release, Erik Menendez shared a statement, released on X by his wife.",
      "He said the show was \"disheartening slander\" and he \"believed we had moved beyond the lies and ruinous character portrayals of Lyle\".",
      "\"It is sad for me to know that Netflix's dishonest portrayal of the tragedies surrounding our crime have taken the painful truths several steps backward - back through time to an era when the prosecution built a narrative on a belief system that males were not sexually abused, and that males experienced rape trauma differently than women,\" he added.",
      "Members of the family also spoke out and said the brothers had been \"victimised by this grotesque shockadrama,\" and the show was \"riddled with mistruths\".",
      "Ryan Murphy, who created the show, told Variety that the comments were \"predictable at best\".",
      "He added that the family's response was \"interesting because I would like specifics about what they think is shocking or not shocking. It's not like we're making any of this stuff up. It's all been presented before\".",

    "summary": "Legendary India batter Virat Kohli announced retirement from international Test cricket on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Virat Kohli's retirement from Tests has left Indian cricket beleaguered and the sporting world gasping in surprise.",
      "Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters.",
      "Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public.",
      "\"As I step away from this format, it's not easy \u2013 but it feels right\u2026'' he explained to his disconsolate fans.",
      "Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal.",
      "Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment.",
      "\"Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,\" recalls Vengsarkar.",
      "An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90.",
      "Vengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation.",
      "Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism.",
      "Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle.",
      "When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history.",
      "He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played.",
      "Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights.",
      "Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight.",
      "Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world.",
      "His achievements across formats are monumental.",
      "In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit.",
      "In T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him in the top five, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in an emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa, which helped India win the title.",
      "He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League.",
      "At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy.",
      "When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp \u2013 between 2014 and 2019 \u2013 he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months.",
      "The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched.",
      "Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format .",
      "As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions.",
      "Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says that Kohli's energy, grit, sense of purpose and aura was \"transformative\" for Indian cricket. Chappell marks him out as the most influential Indian captain, ahead of even Sourav Ganguly and M S Dhoni.",
      "Former India captain and chief coach Ravi Shastri, who collaborated with Kohli for years, gives first-hand perspective.",
      "\"Kohli made India into a fighting unit, especially when playing overseas,\" says Shastri.",
      "The lack of ICC and IPL titles according to Shastri, is misleading as an index to his  captaincy ability.",
      "\"He always played to win, sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas, demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players, putting himself in the forefront, not as a backseat driver.\"",

      "The most cherished and significant triumph of  this period came in 2018 when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a Test series for the first time ever.",
      "Australia is where Kohli had launched himself into batting greatness, scoring 692 runs in four Tests in 2014-15. In 2018, he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier. In 2020 touring Australia, Kohli played only one match (which was lost) returning home for the birth of his child. But India, having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier, went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see-saw series.",
      "Australia was Kohli's happy hunting ground and his last visit Down Under in late 2024 grabbed worldwide attention. He began with a roar, hitting  a century in the first test at Perth. But his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only 190 runs in the five Tests.",

    "summary": "William Ruto has the uncanny ability to attract numerous alternative handles, most are unflattering.",
    "story": [
      "Kenya's President William Ruto is a man of many nicknames.",
      "El Chapo, Kasongo, Hustler, Deputy Jesus and Chicken Seller are just some that he has acquired in recent years.",
      "As is often the case when people are given alternative monikers, some are affectionate but some are intended to mock, while others reflect a profound anger.",
      "A history of the president's aliases offer a window into how the perception of him has changed.",
      "Ruto has acknowledged the rechristening trend, joking recently that Kenyans are \"finishing\" him with the numerous labels.",
      "\"You have given me so many names. I had the name William Kipchirchir Samoei Ruto. You added Survivor\u2026 Zakayo... now you are at Kasongo [the title of a Congolese song about abandonment and heartbreak]. Will you stop at 10, or should I prepare for more?\" he recently asked.",
      "The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had even more.",
      "Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people.",
      "Hustler - Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk.",
      "Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own.",
      "\"These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,\" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC, arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job.",
      "\"Names really stick with Ruto,\" he added.",
      "But the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years until 2022, and has never been far from controversy.",
      "Prof Manyora recalls the label Arap Mashamba \u2013 which translates as \"son of farms\" \u2013 coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired.",
      "In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him the Deputy Jesus tag. He has also been given the name Nabii, or prophet.",
      "However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime \u2013 with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical.",
      "One that has stood out is Zakayo - Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus.",
      "The \u2018tax collector\u2019 president sparking Kenyan angerBBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters",
      "The \u2018tax collector\u2019 president sparking Kenyan anger",
      "BBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters",
      "Ruto's government introduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the \"hustlers\".",
      "\"He failed to deliver after becoming president,\" Prof Manyora said.",
      "The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted, is the focus of many conversations.",
      "Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.",
      "The chant \"Ruto must go\" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and now Must Go has become another way to refer to the leader.",
      "The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel.",
      "Hence the title Vasco da Ganya \u2013 a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means \"to lie\".",

      "Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire",
      "Ruto's honesty has also been called into question with Kaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman.",
      "The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers \u2013 and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning \"lies\".",
      "But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks.",
      "Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames \"don't raise concerns\" in the office of the president but simply \"capture how people view a person\".",
      "Ruto is \"very hands-on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader\", he told the BBC.",
      "Mwaura also argued that the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy.",
      "Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials.",
      "Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as \"reckless\" and \"distasteful\".",
      "Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should be seen as a sign of intolerance by the government.",
      "Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made have been \"unrealistic\", which fuels the nicknames.",
      "He cited the use of El Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.",
      "Mr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is.",
      "Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension.",
      "This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans \"are in a lot of pain\".",
      "She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling.",
      "She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and \"so this is unique [but] in a bad way\".",
      "It is true that previous heads of state had nicknames but they have not been so numerous.",
      "The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (\"young boy\"), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts).",
      "His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter.",
      "Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused, has increased the trend towards name calling.",
      "But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of \"the different problems that people are facing\".",

    "summary": "As the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial unfolds in NYC, here's what to know about Cassie Ventura and other the key witnesses in the case.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial continues next week in New York City. His ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura\u00a0wrapped up her testimony Friday after four days on the stand.",
      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "On Friday, they also heard from a special agent who photographed the hotel where Combs was arrested last year, and from Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard, who testified about seeing Combs assault Ventura.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband and brother were both seen in court for support.",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Jurors are expected to hear from one woman who the defense says had a three-year relationship with Combs that also turned jealous and violent, as well as former employees and an assistant.",
      "Combs has denied all of the allegations through his lawyers, who described the women as \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "Other high-profile names in the Sean Combs case",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all. Ventura testified about dating Jordan, as well as Kid Cudi.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",
      "Combs' defense team is led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who along with his wife Karen Friedman Agnifilo is also defending\u00a0Luigi Mangione\u00a0in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Also on the seven-person defense team is Atlanta attorney Brian Steel, who represented Young Thug in a trial that lasted nearly two years before the rapper pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges.",
      "Can you watch the Diddy trial live?",
      "Per federal court rules, photos and videos from inside court are not allowed. Courtroom sketches, however, are permitted.",

    "story": [
      "At the\u00a0sex trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, his ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, testified for multiple days. Her testimony was completed on Friday.",
      "Ventura is a critical witness in the prosecution's case against Combs, who has been accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and exploiting women for decades until his\u00a0arrest\u00a0on multiple charges last September. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",
      "Here are some key takeaways from Ventrua's testimony.",
      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",
      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",
      "Rape allegation",
      "Ventura told the jury that Combs raped her in her living room in 2018. They were not together at the time and Ventura was seeing the man who is now her husband, she testified. Ventura said she remembered crying and saying no, but Combs did not stop. After, he got up and left, Ventura testified.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape in a lawsuit she filed in 2023. The lawsuit was settled the day after she filed it. Combs denied the allegation.",
      "Text messages",
      "During cross-examination Thursday and Friday, the defense asked Ventura about numerous text messages she and Combs exchanged over the course of their relationship.",
      "They included affectionate messages where Ventura told Combs she loved him and saw a future with him, potentially one that involved starting a family.",
      "Other messages related to the alleged \"freak offs,\" including one exchange allegedly coordinating one of them.",
      "\"You told him you wanted to do freak offs?\" they asked Ventura at one point, to which she replied, \"No, there's a lot more to that.\"",
      "During redirect on Friday, Ventura told prosecutors there were times Combs was kind and loving, but they didn't last.",
      "She said Combs' moods affected her life, career and how she felt about herself, and if Combs wanted a \"freak off,\" then her work would take a backseat.",

      "\"The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock 'n' roll in dangerous times,\" he said. \"In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\"",
      "The 75-year-old rocker, who later shared a transcript and video of his remarks on his website and YouTube channel, asked supporters of democracy to \"raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!\"",
      "Throughout the concert, Springsteen accused Mr. Trump and his administration of authoritarianism, rolling back civil rights, blocking free speech and \"taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers.\"",
      "\"They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,\" Springsteen said. \"They're abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump responded on his social media platform, saying that the rocker is \"just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\"",
      "He added: \"Springsteen is 'dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out 'prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just 'standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!\"",
      "This is not the first time Springsteen has aimed at Mr. Trump and his policies.",
      "When he endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election, Springsteen called Mr. Trump \"the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.\"",
      "\"Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does than at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,\" the rock star said in\u00a0a short video\u00a0shared on social media.",
      "In a\u00a02016 interview\u00a0with Rolling Stone, Springsteen called Mr. Trump a \"moron.\" When Mr. Trump was running for reelection in 2020, Springsteen\u00a0told\u00a0The Atlantic he didn't know \"if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.\"",

      "The Sun, which first reported the story, said producer Abe Diaw told them Sunday that he was hospitalized after Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London in February 2023. Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor.",

      "Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as \"Run It,\" \"Kiss Kiss\" and \"Without You.\" He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for \"F.A.M.E.\" then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for \"11:11 (Deluxe)\" earlier this year.",
      "Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 22:01:30 -0400",
    "summary": "During a 40-year screen career, Robert Benton received six Oscar nominations and won three times.",
    "story": [
      "Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning filmmaker who helped reset the rules in Hollywood as the co-creator of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and later received mainstream validation as the writer-director of \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and \"Places in the Heart,\" has died at age 92.",
      "Benton's son, John Benton, said that he died Sunday at his home in Manhattan of \"natural causes.\"",
      "During a 40-year screen career, the Texas native received six Oscar nominations and won three times: for writing and directing \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and for writing \"Places in the Heart.\" He was widely appreciated by actors as attentive and trusting, and directed Oscar-winning performances by Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Sally Field. Although severe dyslexia left him unable to read more than a few pages at a time as a child, he wrote and directed film adaptations of novels by Philip Roth, E.L. Doctorow and Richard Russo, among others.",
      "Benton was an art director for Esquire magazine in the early 1960s when a love for French New Wave movies and old gangster stories \u2014 and news that a friend got $25,000 for a Doris Day screenplay \u2014 inspired him and Esquire editor David Newman to draft a treatment about the lives of Depression-era robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, imagining them as prototypes for 1960s rebels.",
      "Their project took years to complete as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were among the directors who turned them down before Warren Beatty agreed to produce and star in the movie. \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" directed by Arthur Penn and starring Beatty and Faye Dunaway, overcame initial critical resistance in 1967 to the film's shocking violence and became one of the touchstones of 1960s culture and the start of a more open and creative era in Hollywood.",
      "The original story by Benton and Newman was even more daring: they had made Clyde Barrow bisexual and involved in a 3-way relationship with Bonnie and their male getaway driver. Beatty and Penn both resisted, and Barrow instead was portrayed as impotent, with an uncredited Robert Towne making numerous other changes to the script. \"I honestly don't know who the 'auteur' of 'Bonnie and Clyde' was,\" Benton later told Mark Harris, author of \"Pictures at a Revolution,\" a book about \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and four other movies from 1967.",
      "Over the following decade, none of Benton's films approached the impact of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" although he continued to have critical and commercial success. His writing credits included \"Superman\" and \"What's Up, Doc?\" He directed and co-wrote such well-reviewed works as \"Bad Company,\" a revisionist Western featuring Jeff Bridges, and \"The Late Show,\" a melancholy comedy for which his screenplay received an Oscar nomination.",
      "His career soared in 1979 with his adaptation of the Avery Corman novel \"Kramer vs. Kramer,\" about a self-absorbed advertising executive who becomes a loving parent to his young son after his wife walks out, only to have her return and ask for custody. Starring Hoffman and Streep, the movie was praised as a perceptive, emotional portrait of changing family roles and expectations and received five Academy Awards, including best picture. Hoffman, disenchanted at the time with the film business, would cite \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and Benson's direction for reviving his love for movie acting.",
      "Five years later, Benton was back in the Oscars race with a more personal film, \"Places in the Heart,\" in which he drew upon family stories and childhood memories for his 1930s-set drama starring Fields as a mother of two in Texas who fights to hold on to her land after her husband is killed.",
      "\"I think that when I saw it all strung together, I was surprised at what a romantic view I had of the past,\" Benton told The Associated Press in 1984, adding that the movie was in part a tribute to his mother, who had died shortly before the release of \"Kramer vs. Kramer.\"",
      "Benton was born in Waxahachie, Texas, outside of Dallas. He owed his early love for movies to his father, telephone company employee Ellery Douglass Benton, who, instead of asking about homework, would take his family to the picture shows. The elder Benton would also share memories of attending the funerals of outlaws Barrow and Parker, Texas natives who grew up in the Dallas area.",
      "Robert Benton studied at the University of Texas and Columbia University, then served in the U.S. Army from 1954 until 1956. While at Esquire, Benton helped start the magazine's long-standing Dubious Achievement Award and dated Gloria Steinem, then on staff at the humor magazine Help! He married artist Sallie Rendigs in 1964. They had one son.",
      "Between hits, Benton often endured long dry spells. His latter films included such disappointments as the thrillers \"Billy Bathgate,\" \"The Human Stain\" and \"Twilight.\" He had much more success with \"Nobody's Fool,\" a wry comedy released in 1994 and starring Paul Newman, in his last Oscar-nominated performance, as a small-town troublemaker in upstate New York. Benton, whose film was based on Russo's novel, was nominated for best adapted screenplay.",
      "\"Somebody asked me once when the Academy Award nominations came out and I'd been nominated, 'What's the great thing about the Academy Awards?'\" Benton told Venice magazine in 1998. \"I said, 'When you go to the awards and you see people, some of whom you've had bitter fights with, some of whom you're close friends with, some people you haven't seen in ten years, some people you just saw two days before \u2014 it's your family.' It's home. And home is what I've spent my life looking for.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 Kim Kardashian\u00a0took the witness stand for four-and-a-half hours Tuesday in the trial over the 2016 armed robbery in which a masked gang made off with $10 million worth of her jewelry as she visited the French capital. Kardashian testified that one member of the gang pulled her to him while she was in just a bathrobe.",
      "\"I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\" Kardashian said. \"I absolutely did think I was going to die,\" she added.",
      "\"I thought about my sister, thought she would walk in and see me shot dead and have that memory in her forever,\" she told the court, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Kardashian testified the robbery happened at around 3 a.m. at her hotel. She was in bed about to fall asleep when she heard people stomping up the stairs and then entering her bedroom wearing police uniforms.",
      "Kardashian said that once they got inside her suite, the masked thieves pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"Then I heard one of the gentlemen forcefully say, 'Ring! Ring!' in English, with an accent, pointing,\" she told the court, according to Reuters, apparently referring to the $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West, now known as Ye. The couple\u00a0settled for divorce\u00a0in 2022.",
      "\"It was at the end of the bed, so he grabs my leg and pulls me toward him on the bed so the robe is opened and everything is exposed,\" Kardashian said. \"And that was the moment when I thought he would rape me. But he ended up tying me up and closed my legs.\"",
      "During Tuesday's testimony, Kardashian also responded directly to one of the defendants after she was read an apology letter in court.",
      "\"I forgive you,\" Kardashian told Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the man alleged to be the brains behind the robbery, after his lawyer read a letter to the court sent by his client to the celebrity a year after the robbery, in which he said he was sorry.",
      "At the central Paris courthouse where the trial is taking place, there was intense security and crowd control measures in place. The court opened early to allow journalists and members of the public access ahead of Kardashian's afternoon appearance.",
      "Flanked by four bodyguards, Kardashian entered the courthouse by the rear entrance. As she mounted the stone steps, she turned, took off her dark sunglasses and smiled at the gathered crowd of fans, curious passersby and press photographers.",
      "Dressed in black, with her hair up in a chignon, the celebrity was accompanied by her mother, Kris Jenner.",
      "The hearing was not broadcast publicly, as France rarely allows cameras in courtrooms. Some 400 reporters applied to attend the trial, but there were only 40 places allocated for media inside the courtroom. A side room was set up for 200 more journalists to watch a live transmission from inside the courtroom.",
      "After giving evidence all afternoon, Kardashian left the courthouse with her mother and bodyguards, without speaking to the crowds of fans and press waiting for her.",
      "Kardashian's lawyers said she was determined to testify in person about the night she was allegedly tied up and robbed at gunpoint while she was in Paris for Fashion Week. Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 face charges including robbery and kidnapping against the American media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "Before the celebrity took the stand herself, her longtime friend-turned-stylist Simone Harouche told the court on Tuesday that she heard Kardashian begging for her life during the attack in the hotel suite they were sharing.",
      "\"'I have babies and I need to live!' That is what she kept on saying, 'Take everything. I need to live,'\" Harouche told the court. \"I was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst.\"",
      "Prosecutors have told the court that when the gang, dressed as police officers, arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where Kardashian was staying, they demanded that the concierge, at gunpoint, guide them to \"the rapper's wife,\" a reference to her then-husband.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified during the intrusion, thinking she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun, like clear as day,\" she said on her show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" adding: \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "The robbers, some of whom escaped on bicycles, have been dubbed \"the Grandpa robbers\" as most of the suspects were in their 60s at the time of the heist.",
      "As they fled, they dropped a diamond and platinum cross that was found the next morning by a local resident. The rest of the haul has not been recovered.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery. Khedache, now 69, is accused of masterminding the heist. Known as \"Old Omar,\" he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was, but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "Khedache wrote to Kardashian in 2017, while he was in custody, to apologize. Her lawyers said he wrote after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "\"I want to reach out to you as a human being to tell you how much I regret my actions, how much I was moved and touched to see your tears,\" Khedache wrote. \"Of course, we cannot undo the past but I hope this letter will make you gradually forget the traumatism you experienced through my fault.\"",
      "Kardashian wept as she listened, then said: \"I appreciate the letter. I forgive you for what happened. That said, it doesn't change my trauma nor the fact that my life was changed forever.\"",
      "Khedache responded: \"Your forgiveness is like the sun lighting me up. Thank you.\"",
      "Yunice Abbas, the 71-year-old who has already admitted in court that he was the lookout, told Kardashian: \"I formally, sincerely apologize.\"",
      "In court on April 29, he expressed \"total regret\" for his part in the heist. He said he understood afterward that, \"when you steal a lady's purse, it can be traumatic\" for her.",
      "A police officer who testified for the prosecution told the court Kardashian appeared \"traumatized\" in the immediate aftermath of the robbery.",
      "Lawyers for some of the accused expressed concern as the trial opened last month that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "Chloe Arnoux, who represents Khedache, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you, journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",
      "Kardashian's lawyer Michael Rhodes said in April that the reality TV star and entrepreneur had \"tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system,\" and \"wishes for the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",

      "In Europe, it is illegal to add the ingredient to bread, given the possibility it could result in a possible carcinogen called semicarbazide when it breaks down into other chemicals during bread making.",
      "After international health authorities in recent years also raised concerns over its use in food, guidance from 1965 that had previously allowed for its use was withdrawn by a committee convened by the United Nations over worries that there was not enough data to support its safety.",

      "On a quiet plot of land in rural New Mexico, Jeff Deming feels like he's really living, once again.",
      "\"Mentally, it's day and night,\" he said.",
      "He's able to do the things that make him happy, like woodworking, despite living with Parkinson's Disease.",
      "\"Physically, I feel better than I did 2-3 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Deming credits the treatment he received during a first-of-its-kind clinical study he participated in at the University of California, San Francisco: Psilocybin therapy for people with Parkinson's Disease.",
      "\"This is very clich\u00e9, but it truly gave me my life back,\" he said.",
      "Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in 'magic mushrooms.' When administered in controlled, clinical research settings, it has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety, both of which are mood symptoms associated with Parkinson's that are linked to a faster physical decline.",
      "\"The neurodegeneration that is happening isn't just impacting motor circuitry \u2013 it's impacting a lot of brain circuitry. That creates this huge burden of symptoms that we often overlook and don't talk about enough, maybe,\" said Dr. Ellen Bradley, of UCSF. \"We were really surprised by how well this trial went.\"",
      "Bradley and a team of researchers at UCSF are trying to figure out how Psilocybin may help treat mood dysfunction and more in those living with the neurodegenerative disease.",
      "\"This is a first step, and now we've opened the door to being able to really investigate the effects of Psilocybin for people with Parkinson's,\" she said.",
      "12 patients participated in this first-round study, which involved a first and second course of Psilocybin treatment.",
      "\"We had folks do a lower dose of Psilocybin \u2013 a 10 mg dose initially \u2013 and monitored them for a couple of weeks to see how that went,\" Bradley said. \"If it did go well, if we didn't have safety concerns, then they were eligible for the full therapeutic dose of 25 mg.\"",
      "All 12 patients were able to complete both courses of treatment without reporting any serious side effects, according to Bradley.",
      "\"We want to find out not just does Psilocybin therapy work, but if it does, how does it work? That mechanistic piece is so important,\" she said. \"Can it change the brain's ability to adapt to its environment and to rewire itself?\"",
      "While there were no serious adverse effects reported, every patient didn't have the same life-changing experience as Deming says he experienced. Though many did report their motor and cognitive functions improved afterwards, per Bradley.",
      "\"We don't have a reason to believe that this is a treatment that is going to be a good fit for every patient. That is never really our expectation in medicine. But our goal is to figure out when is it the right treatment and how much for which patient,\" Bradley said.",
      "Bradley says her team is scaling up their work and are in the process of recruiting for a larger study, due to the success with the initial research.",
      "\"That was really exciting just to see that promising safety profile in this initial pilot. That kind of gives us a green light to go forward with more in-depth research,\" she said. \"We really desperately need new treatments for Parkinson's. It's a very quickly growing disease that's becoming more and more prevalent in our population, so, we really feel like we have to be investigating every possible route that could mean new treatments for patients.\"",
      "Two years removed from his controlled Psilocybin dosing, Deming says he feels better now than he did when he received his initial diagnosis four years ago.",
      "\"Something about this experience just freed everything back up so I could think again, I could dream again,\" he said.",
      "He'd like to see more research into psychedelic therapies for a range of conditions, with the hopes that more people will be able to reclaim the reins of life, as he has.",
      "\"There's been such a stigma against the research with it,\" he said. \"It is definitely worth looking more closely at.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 16:34:13 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether he supported the president's plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he thought \"it'll be the subject of probably multiple lawsuits, and I think the courts will probably have something to say about it.\"",

    "story": [
      "The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and a handful of teams at the agency had their layoff notices rescinded Tuesday, multiple officials say, and several worker safety programs that had been eliminated by layoffs last month are being restored.",
      "Letters reversing the layoffs arrived in the inboxes of some NIOSH staff a day ahead of House and Senate hearings Wednesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs.",
      "Health officials and scientists being brought back to work include everyone in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary's leadership, NIOSH's essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations,\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.",
      "A handful of NIOSH staff working in the agency's World Trade Center Health Program previously had their layoffs reversed, after a second round of cuts at the agency earlier this month.",
      "\"While we celebrate with those who received a rescission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not. I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH,\" the agency's now-reinstated director, Dr. John Howard, wrote in the email.",
      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",
      "But many workers also remain effectively laid-off at the wide-ranging agency, which functions as the research and testing counterpart to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration.",
      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",
      "NIOSH had also been in the process of developing similar monitors for miners exposed to silica dust, before the layoffs gutted the teams overseeing that work.",
      "Other NIOSH teams like the Health Effects Laboratory Division were also not listed among the reinstatements.",
      "Other parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which currently houses NIOSH, also remain off the job, despite calls from states and lawmakers for their reinstatements. HHS previously said it was planning on moving what remained of NIOSH into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Among the CDC scientists still laid-off include the agency's laboratories for investigating STD and viral hepatitis, which upended work helping states investigate outbreaks. Staff in the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for a range of issues including lead poisoning and cruise ship outbreaks, also have not been reinstated.",
      "Other workers who have been promised by their supervisors that they would be reinstated elsewhere at HHS have also so far not received notices, like at the Food and Drug Administration's drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit.",

      "Some experts worry the recent decline could be slowed or stopped by reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce, or a shift away from the strategies that seem to be working.",

      "A CDC report late last year showed that overdose deaths in the U.S. fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024 \u2014 credited in part to wider naloxone access. Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan,  was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase\u00a0in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders\u00a0to carry. It's even popped up\u00a0in some classrooms.",

      "Experts note that there have been past moments when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again. That happened in 2018.",
      "But there are reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past. The deals over the last decade or so have promised about $50 billion over time, with most of it required to be used to fight addiction.",

      "President Trump ripped into Walmart, saying on social media Saturday that the retail giant should \"eat the tariffs\" instead of blaming the duties on imported goods imposed by his administration for its increased prices.",
      "Walmart on Thursday warned that everything from bananas to children's car seats could increase in price despite the softer tariffs on China.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first quarter earnings call Thursday. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",
      "The price hikes are expected to go into effect later this month.",
      "As Mr. Trump has jacked up import taxes, he has tried to assure a skeptical public that foreign producers would pay for those taxes and that retailers and automakers would absorb the additional expenses.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday, the president lashed out at Walmart \u2013 which employs some 1.6 million people in the United States \u2013 and said the company should sacrifice its profits for the sake of his economic agenda. Mr. Trump says his economic plan will eventually lead to more domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "\"Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,\" Trump posted. \"Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, \"EAT THE TARIFFS,\" and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I'll be watching, and so will your customers!!!\"",

Mr. Trump has similarly warned domestic automakers not to raise their prices, even though outside analyses say his tariffs would raise production costs.",
      "In April, McMillon was among the retail executives who met with Mr. Trump at the White House to discuss tariffs and potential negative outcomes. But the Trump administration went forward despite warnings and has attacked other companies, such as Amazon and Apple, that are struggling with the disruptions to their supply chains.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Ratings on Friday, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "The downgrade from the top rating of Aaa to Aa1 \"reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\" the credit rating firm said in a statement on Friday.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" Moody's added.",
      "Moody's also highlighted the environment of heightened policy uncertainty driven by Mr. Trump's evolving trade priorities.",
      "Moody's is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade U.S. government debt. In August 2011, Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+, and in August 2023\u00a0Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating a notch from AAA to AA+.",
      "Moody's said it expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by \"increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.''",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 18:37:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

    "story": [
      "Kroger shoppers might be paying more at checkout than they bargained for.",
      "A new investigation\u00a0found price tag errors at the supermarket giant's stores leading to customers being overcharged on many items marked as discounted or on sale. Expired discount tags were found on everyday products ranging from Cheerios cereal to Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffee, according to an investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian and the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN).",
      "The probe stems from allegations made by Kroger employees in Colorado who are currently in labor negotiations with the supermarket chain.",
      "\"People should pay the price that is being advertised, that's the law,\" Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, who runs the Consumer World website, told Consumer Reports. \"The issue here is that shoppers can't rely on the shelf price being accurate, and that's a big problem.\"",
      "Kroger operates roughly 2,700 stores throughout the U.S., according to the company's\u00a0website, and owns a suite of supermarkets that includes Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Fry's and Ralphs.",
      "To conduct the investigation, Consumer Reports, The Guardian and FERN recruited people to shop at more than two dozen Kroger and Kroger-owned stores in 14 states and the District of Columbia over a roughly three-month period this year.",
      "The investigation found that expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. For instance, a bag of Mission Flour Tortillas at a Harris Teeter in Alexandria, Virginia, was advertised as on sale for $2.99, while customers were charged $4.99.",
      "Although pricing mistakes were not found at all the Kroger stores in the investigation, the probe found issues at over half of the 26 locations it examined.",
      "Kroger took issue with the findings, saying the investigation greatly overstates the pricing issues.",
      "The \"characterization of widespread pricing concerns is patently false,\" a Kroger spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, adding that the errors cited by the investigators represented only a \"few dozen examples across several years out of billions of customer transactions annually.\"",
      "Although Consumer Price Index\u00a0data shows\u00a0the rate of inflation and grocery prices eased last month, Americans continue to face higher\u00a0costs for household goods.",
      "\"Even if the incidents are careless rather than calculated, it creates a perception that Kroger is ripping people off,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with retail industry research firm GlobalData in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not what any grocery retailer wants or needs when the consumer is looking to maximize value for money.\"",
      "Kroger not alone in overcharging claims",
      "The overcharging problem is not unique to Kroger: Retailers like Walmart, Safeway, Albertsons and Vons have\u00a0been hit with similar allegations.",
      "Grocery giant Albertsons in October agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the California chain of selling items for more than their lowest advertised price.",
      "But the Kroger case stand out for several reasons said Derek Kravitz, an investigative journalist and author of the Consumer Reports story. One is that in states in the Midwest and the South, where the retailer has a strong foothold, Kroger is often one of just a few places to choose from for grocery shopping.",
      "Kravitz also pointed to the persistent flow of complaints from Kroger customers over out-of-date sales prices, dating back to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ohio, for example, the attorney general's office has received nearly 60 complaints of price tag and overcharge issues at Kroger since 2021.",
      "\"Almost every single time I go in the store, the listed price of an item is NOT what rings up at the register,\" Belpre resident Allison Hadfield noted in one of three complaints she and her husband, Derek, filed against their local Kroger store, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "Shopper Elizabeth Giovanni also submitted several complaints to her local Kroger store in Millington, Tennessee. In one case, she said an entire dairy case with cheese had expired signs.",
      "\"I've recently stopped shopping there because of their lack of accountability and willingness to change the prices when they're in the wrong,\" she said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to individual complaints, customers have also filed multiple class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations, with cases ongoing in California, Ohio and Illinois, according to The Guardian.",
      "Kroger said it has taken steps to fix price discrepancies. That includes instituting a policy that gives employees the authority to fix price problems on the spot.",
      "\"Kroger is committed to affordable and accurate pricing, and we conduct robust price check processes that reviews millions of items weekly to ensure our shelf prices are accurate,\" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Potential staffing issues",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the average number of employees at the Kroger-owned stores that the researchers focused on fell by 10.3%, or 17 employees per store, according to the report, which cites data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The average number of hours worked also fell by 2.7 hours per week.",
      "\"There are simply not enough employees to manually switch out price labels on shelves because some stores have tens of thousands of price tags hanging at any one time,\" Kravitz wrote in the report.",
      "Kroger denies there is a problem with understaffing. In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Kroger spokesperson said work hours and staffing at its stores have not been reduced.",
      "\"We intentionally staff our stores to keep them running smoothly while creating an enjoyable place to shop,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our staffing decisions are data-driven to balance workload and schedules.\"",

Ahn shouted \"Hurrah for Korea!\" as he was arrested, according to the Association for Asian Studies based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.",

      "The House Republican bill to enact President Trump's domestic policy agenda contains a provision that has prompted opposition from the Mexican government \u2014 a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries.",
      "The payments, known as remittances, would be subject to a 5% excise tax that would encompass more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "In a May 13 letter to the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, Esteban Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., urged Chairman Jason Smith and Ranking Member Richard Neal to reconsider the proposal.",
      "\"We respectfully urge you to reconsider this section of the legislative proposal, and we remain available to continue dialogue on the matter,\" wrote Barrag\u00e1n and Robert Velasco Alvarez, Mexico's chief officer for North America.",
      "Spokespeople for both Smith and Neal did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In April, President Trump hinted at a crackdown on remittances, announcing in a Truth Social Post\u00a0that the administration was \"finalizing a presidential memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside of the United States.\" But details on the presidential proposal were unclear.",
      "The remittance tax provisions in the bill have become an international flashpoint. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has also criticized the plan and urged Republican lawmakers to reconsider it.",
      "At a press briefing this week, Sheinbaum warned that the proposal \"would damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\"",
      "\"Remittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States', which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\" she said.",
      "An estimate by the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, which is cited in the letter, found that Mexican migrant workers sent on average 16.7% of their labor income as remittances.",
      "\"In other words, more than 80% of the income generated by this community remains in the U.S. economy,\" the letter says.",
      "The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, however, that the proposal would generate a little more than $1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2026, and rise to about $3 billion by 2034.",
      "In the letter to lawmakers, Barrag\u00e1n said the proposal would amount to double taxation, \"since migrants already pay taxes in the country where they work.\"",
      "\"Imposing a tax on these transfers would disproportionately affect those with the least, without accounting for their ability to pay,\" he added and also warned of other unintended consequences.",
      "\"Many migrants might seek informal or unregulated means to do so, complicating oversight and control of these financial flows. This would not only reduce the expected revenue but also increase risks related to financial security, tax evasion and money laundering,\" he wrote.",

Tony Gonzalez, whose district spans the length of much of the state's border with Mexico and is home to many migrant workers. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and Florida Rep Maria Elvira Salazar attended the dinner.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/electricity-bill-summer-2025-inflation-high-temperatures-neada/",
    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 13:17:34 -0400",
    "summary": "High temperatures and rising electricity costs could boost home energy bills by 6% this summer, a new report says.",
    "story": [
      "High temperatures projected across the U.S. summer could take a toll on Americans' budgets by driving up the price of keeping homes cool.",
      "Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, up more than 6% from $737 in 2024 and marking a 12-year record, according a new analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "The growing expense comes on the heels of a cold winter that drove up heating costs for many Americans, and as consumers continue to grapple with higher prices on everyday goods. Consumers are also increasingly expressing concerns about how tariffs\u00a0could affect their day-to-day costs, Gallup polling has found.",
      "\"We found that it's going to be another expensive summer for air conditioning because temperatures will stay high, and electricity prices have been rising faster than inflation,\" energy economist Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures, NEADA said. Those trends mean that households are not only expected to pay higher prices for electricity, but will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling.",
      "\"It's not just temperatures that are going up, but the cost of cooling is going up,\" Wolfe said. \"And when electricity prices go up, they tend to stay high. So even if temperatures moderate, your bill might go up because of the cost of electricity.\"",
      "Unpaid bills",
      "Energy costs eat up a larger share of low-income families' budgets compared to higher-earners. Low-income households spend roughly 8.6% of their incomes on energy costs, compared to 3% for those that are higher up the income ladder, according to NEADA.",
      "Worryingly, the lowest earners could struggle to afford to keep their homes cool, Wolfe noted. The most recent Census Household Pulse Survey found that 37% of low- and moderate-income households could not afford their energy bills for at least one month between April 2023 and April 2024.",
      "If those households find themselves in a financial crunch this summer, they may opt to turn off their air conditioning, which could pose serious health risks, noted Wolfe.",
      "\"Last winter was cold, so they're just getting over paying their heating bills, and are now facing higher summer cooling costs,\" Wolfe explained. \"And while people understand that if you don't use heat in the winter, your pipes will freeze, that won't happen in the summer.\"",
      "Reluctance to turn on one's air conditioning can have adverse health effects like heat stroke. \"While this won't do damage to your building, it will do damage to you,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Extreme heat and health",
      "Public assistance programs haven't kept pace with the evolving climate, according to Wolfe. \"We're having heat waves that are lasting longer, and the systems in place to protect families have not kept up,\" he said.",
      "This summer's cooling cost forecast should be taken as a sign that state and federal assistance programs require modernization, according to Wolfe. Only 26 states offer summer cooling assistance to help Americans pay their bills. Thirty-three states have no protections in place to prevent utilities company from shutting off customers' access to electricity when they're behind on payments.",
      "Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Wolfe says that taking steps to modernize your home can actually help households save money. For example, adding insulation to your house can help control energy bills.",
      "\"Families should start preparing for long-term extreme weather and think about the energy efficiency of their cooling systems,\" he said.",

      "The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index,\u00a0released Friday, declined 2.7% on a monthly basis to 50.8, the lowest reading since July 2022. Since January, sentiment has tumbled nearly 30%, a sign Americans are worried about the economy and their financial prospects, according to economists.",

      "Weinberg added that the decline in confidence may cause Americans to hold back on purchasing big-ticket items until they have a clearer picture of what's happening in the economy. \"Uncertainty usually foments a feeling in households that more saving is a good idea,\" he added.",
      "Less grim than it looks?",
      "Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that the U. of Michigan's initial survey likely failed to capture any improvement in sentiment from the U.S. and China agreeing to ease tariffs earlier this week.",
      "\"[W]e increasingly suspect that the consumer surveys, and the Michigan survey in particular, are painting an unduly negative picture of the consumer outlook at present,\" Allen said in a report. \"Headline retail sales eked out a further small gain in April, following a 1.7% jump in March, despite the recent plunge in confidence. Moreover, most near-real indicators of consumers' discretionary spending on services are holding up well.\"",
      "Trump in April slapped 145% tariffs on all imports from China, a move that effectively froze trade with the U.S.' third-largest trading partner in goods. But on Monday, the two countries said they\u00a0agreed\u00a0to lower U.S. tariffs to 30%, while China would cut its duties on U.S. exports to 10% from 125%.",

      "\"[W]e have, at the same time, 150 countries that want to make a deal, but you're not able to see that many countries,\" Mr. Trump said during a Friday business roundtable between the U.S. and United Arab Emirates.",
      "Americans have largely taken a sour view about where the economy is headed in the wake of the Trump administration's imposition of huge import duties, which threaten to slow growth and push up prices. In recent weeks, the White House has pulled back on its most draconian policies, though average duties are still high by historical standards.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 10:32:11 -0400",
    "summary": "The bottom 60% of U.S. households don't make enough money to afford a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new report.",
      "The analysis, from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), looks beyond whether people can afford daily necessities like food and shelter to consider whether they have the means to pay for things like the technology tools necessary for their jobs, higher education, and health and child care.",
      "LISEP tracks costs associated with what the research firm calls a \"basket of American dream essentials.\" The group says its Minimal Quality of Life index provides a truer picture of how Americans are faring than standard economic data, such as the nation's gross domestic product and jobless rate. The index captures the annual change in the typical costs facing low- and moderate-income households who are looking to maintain a basic quality of life.",
      "\"We analyze these components not just in terms of financial figures but as crucial elements that shape a family's capability to achieve a desirable standard of living,\" the group explains in a paper describing its approach.",
      "The findings? For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a \"minimal quality of life\" is out of reach, according to the group, a research organization focused on improving lower earners' economic well-being.",
      "\"The middle class has been declining \u2014 we just haven't recognized it fully,\" LISEP Chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's really dangerous because it's the kind of thing that leads to social unrest, and it's not fair. The American dream is not that it's given to you \u2014 it's that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead and achieve the things in life that you want to achieve. It's not living in a tent, not having to steal.\"",
      "The Ludwig Institute also says that the nation's official\u00a0unemployment rate of 4.2%\u00a0greatly understates the level of economic distress around the U.S. Factoring in workers who are stuck in poverty-wage jobs and people who are unable to find full-time employment, the U.S. jobless rate now tops 24%, according to LISEP, which defines these groups as \"functionally unemployed.\"",
      "Peering beneath the surface",
      "By those standards, the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living, according to LISEP. These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "\"Traditional headline economic indicators like GDP and unemployment tell us the economy is thriving, but they don't reflect the lived reality of most Americans,\" Ludwig said in a statement. \"Americans are working harder than ever, fueling our economic growth, but the benefits of that hard work are not being distributed in a way that supports upward mobility for too many middle- and low-income Americans.\"",
      "From 2001 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis. Housing and health care costs surged, while the amount of savings required to attend an in-state, public university soared 122%.",
      "Meanwhile, median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4% over that span when adjusting for the cost of goods tracked by the group's index, according to LISEP. Income growth for these households has also lagged, rising 0.37% per year during the same period \u2014 less than half as much as for the top 40% of earners, the group found.",
      "The gap between how much low-income families earn and how much they need to afford a minimum cost of living is expected to keep widening, Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it is growing because the items that go into the basket of goods and services that make the minimal quality of life are inflating at a higher rate than wages are inflating,\" he said.",

      "For example, some customers sought refunds they were due related to flight cancellations or delays, while others sought reimbursement they were owed for lost or damaged piece of luggage. Airlines now face added pressure under new rules\u00a0adopted in 2024 that require them to provide automatic refunds to customers when their flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",

That year, they jumped to more than 102,000 during what was a catastrophic period for air carriers, given travel restrictions and plummeting demand for flying. Airlines struggled to ramp capacity back up in 2021 and 2022, resulting in plenty of cancellations and delays.",
      "At the top 10 U.S. airlines, cancellations rose from 1.28% of flights in 2023 to 1.36% last year, resulting in a total of 102,908 canceled flights in 2024, according to the report. Delays also worsened, with 78.1% of flights arriving on time last year, down from 78.3% in 2023. In total, roughly 1.7 million flights were either delayed or canceled in 2024.",
      "Nationwide air traffic controller shortages could lead to more snarls in schedules for the remainder of 2025, PIRG said.",
      "One relative bright spot in the report: Airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs in 2024 compared to the previous year. While that showed some modest improvement, 2.7 million bags were still lost or damaged, as were 11,357 wheelchairs and scooters.",
      "The carrier with the highest rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers: Frontier Airlines, which had the worst cancellation record, worst record for on-time arrivals and worst record for involuntary bumping, PIRG found. It ranked second-worst for the share of wheelchairs that it mishandled.",
      "\"That's a lot of worsts,\" Murray said.",
      "There are steps consumers can take to make travel less painful, Murray noted. For one, she recommends that passengers always download an airline's app for up-to-date flight schedule information.",
      "She also suggests putting an AirTag or similar device in both checked and carry-one luggage in case an airline requires that it be checked at the gate.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 09:04:24 -0400",
    "summary": "From $99 dresses on DoorDash to bespoke gowns, David's Bridal strives to charm every kind of bride.",
    "story": [
      "David's Bridal, the 75-year-old company serving budget-conscious brides and wedding parties, is courting the \"affordable luxury\" market.",
      "The go-to store for brides on a budget has launched a higher-end, bricks-and-mortar chain called Diamonds & Pearls that offers dresses ranging from $700 to more than $5,000. David's expansion into the luxury segment comes two years after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2023, citing inflation and pressures.",
      "The first Diamonds & Pearls store opened Thursday in Delray Beach, Florida. David's operates 193 stores across the U.S., selling gowns that range in cost from $500 to $3,000.",
      "While the company has long held a grip on the value-end of the bridal market, it was missing the luxury piece and wanted to serve customers looking for premium offerings, David's CEO Kelly Cook told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We found that 90% of all brides were in David's funnel, but we didn't have products to serve the couture bride, or the budget bride. We only had products to serve the middle,\" Cook said. \"Affordable luxury is the fastest-growing segment we have.\"",
      "Cook explained that brides are under pressure as tariffs weigh on the cost of weddings, which stands at $37,500 on average, she said. An\u00a0estimate from Fidelity pegs the average cost of a wedding in 2024 at $33,000.",
      "David's solved the budget consumer's end of the equation first. In March, it began selling wedding dresses for as little as $99, under the DB Studio label. And in December 2024, David's partnered with delivery service DoorDash to let customers order dresses on the app and have them delivered in minutes \u2014 along with dessert.",
      "Roughly 17% of David's brides are shopping for dresses for weddings that are within three weeks, \"So we have to serve the last-minute brides,\" Cook said.",
      "Now, it's moving up the luxury scale, offering made-to-order dresses, including gowns from designers like Marchesa and Viola Chan, and serving champagne to brides-to-be at its Diamonds & Pearls store. The company has plans to open at least one more Diamonds & Pearls store this year, Cook said.",
      "Cook's ultimate goal for the company is to serve every type of consumer \u2014 including grooms \u2014 along every step of the wedding planning process. That includes launching its own AI-powered wedding planning tools, video content and more.",
      "The company is now in a growth spurt, undeterred by President Trump's evolving tariff program\u00a0that is dissuading some companies from investing in growth. Mr. Trump had imposed tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese imports, which now stand at 30% for a period of 90 days.",
      "Although it previously produced 67% of its own line of dresses in China, David's plans to move all of its production out of China by the end of June, according to Cook, adding that its factories in Myanmar, India and Vietnam will pick up the slack.",
      "Despite the range in prices, DB Studio, dresses on DoorDash and Diamonds & Pearls all share a common denominator, which is \"absolute quality,\" according to Cook.",

      "Walmart on Thursday warned that even softer tariffs on China could soon force the company to raise prices on certain items.",
      "The world's largest retailer said President Trump's wide-ranging levies on U.S. trade partners are impeding its ability to keep prices low for its customers.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first quarter earnings call Thursday. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",
      "The price hikes will go into effect later this month. Walmart, a bellwether for consumer spending, joins other larger retailers in warning that they are\u00a0likely to raise prices\u00a0as tariffs drive up their costs.",
      "Rising cost pressures for retailers",
      "The Trump administration on Monday said that, starting May 14, it is lowering the tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days. As part of that agreement, China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%. The sides are expected to continue negotiations, although ongoing uncertainty over trade policy is weighing on companies.",
      "\"The merchandise that we import comes from all over the world from dozens of countries,\" McMillon said. \"Other than the U.S., the other large markets are China, Mexico, Vietnam, India and Canada. China, in particular, represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys. All of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact. The cost pressure from all the tariff impacted markets started in late April, and it accelerated in May.\"",
      "Still, the Walmart executive emphasized that the retailer will do what it can to avoid\u00a0passing the import taxes onto customers.",
      "\"We'll do our best on what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible,\" McMillon said. \"In  some cases we are holding retail prices where they are despite the tariffs cost pressures.\"",
      "Grocery prices dropped slightly last month, declining 0.1% from March, according to government data. However, many household costs remain elevated, the CBS News price tracker shows.",
      "Walmart also pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty, as Mr. Trump vows to strike favorable trade deals with countries that are subject to steep levies on imports.",
      "Walmart earned $4.4 billion in the quarter ended April 30, down from $5.1 billion in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 2.5% to $165.6 billion, just short of analyst estimates.",
      "Tariff hit on consumer spending",
      "Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in the earnings call that the company expects the U.S. to strike more agreements with its trade partners, and that tariff rates could drop.",
      "\"However, if we see a restoration of dramatically higher tariff levels, the impact on our financials could be significant and even jeopardize our ability to grow earnings year-over-year,\" he added.",
      "Tuan Nguyen, U.S. economist at consulting firm RSM US, said the latest retail data shows consumers are reducing their spending at stores and restaurants.",
      "\"We are now witnessing the first-order effects of tariffs on the economy \u2014 through reduced spending. The second-order impact \u2014 on prices \u2014 will likely emerge in the coming months, putting additional pressure on demand,\" he said in an email.",

      "When his new shipments began arriving two weeks ago, he was hit with President Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese goods. The duty tax bills he received from U.S. Customs ranged from $9,000 to $21,000.",
      "Prior to the tariff hike, Djavaheri said he would have paid \"a couple hundred dollars\" on a shipment.",
      "\"People need to understand that when you have a very low-margin business, it makes it almost impossible to do business,\" Djavaheri said.",
      "But now, just two weeks later \u2014 with the tariff on Chinese imports reduced to 30% for at least 90 days following a truce Monday between the United States and China \u2014 Djavaheri said he has had to pivot again.",
      "He said the 30% tariff is still \"not cheap,\" especially on higher-priced goods.",

      "\"The duties are a huge outlay of cash that these businesses are facing,\" Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a logistics company that helps businesses move goods, told CBS News. \"And a lot of them are in a position where they don't want to just pay that right away. They'd rather leave the goods here until the last minute when they need them.\"",
      "Flexport is now seeing high demand for both foreign trade zone facilities and bonded warehouses that are located near ports and airports. These facilities allow companies to store their cargo and temporarily avoid tariffs.",
      "\"Both types of facilities allow you to defer payment of the duties until the goods leave the building,\" Petersen said.",
      "Djavaheri said he'll never get back the money he paid out on the 145% tariff rate. And he believes the financial whiplash means he cannot count on making a profit this year. Instead, he will just try to stay afloat.",

      "One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Grouette spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn't land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \"It was this implied, 'You're stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "Indeed, despite the unemployment rate still hovering at a historic low\u00a0at 4.2%, for an increasing number of out-of-work Americans, it's taking longer to find a new job. Meanwhile, the gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity.",
      "Grouette, however, eventually found a way out of her toxic workplace. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she was working a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\"You can't put a price tag on it,\" she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\"",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\"We're developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\" said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Disagreement vs. abuse",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \"if I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a 'Suck it up' attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \"I don't think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\"",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\"What makes something toxic: It's more pervasive, more consistent over time,\" Tosti-Kharas said. \"You may have tried some things and it's not getting better. ... It's very deeply entrenched.\"",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\"It is a relationship where you can't communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can't say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\" Atchison said.",
      "Follow your gut",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\"I'm reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I'm applying to, because I can't lose my hair again over a job,\" said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\"It's almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\" Atchison said. \"If someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\"",
      "More complaints since COVID-19",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\"Socializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "Document your concerns",
      "\"Don't hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you're talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don't internalize it. And don't take someone's perception as fact.\"",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \"I'm going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\" she said. \"Is there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else's opinion?\"",
      "Human resources may or may not help",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \"In the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it's you who has to go somewhere,\" Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \"you wouldn't say, 'Let me try to work with the radon,' or 'How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?'\" she said. \"You would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\"",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\"If somebody gives you an impression that you're not able to leave this job, that's just not true,\" Grouette said. \"Those sorts of people don't have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they're volatile to you, they're volatile to others.\"",

    "summary": "Seniors are unlikely to get a break on paying taxes on their Social Security benefits, an issue that impacts more people each year.",
    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation now winding its way through the House includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay, as well as sharply lowering lowering rates on corporations. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in the bill approved by the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday. If the measure passes the House, it would then move to the Senate. The bill would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",

      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is cautioning that the U.S. could face an increase in supply shocks. The comes a week after the central bank announced it would\u00a0hold interest rates steady amid a period of economic uncertainty.",
      "\"We may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks \u2014 a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks,\" Powell said Thursday at a\u00a0conference in Washington, D.C., where U.S. bankers were meeting to discuss monetary policy.",
      "Analysts\u00a0have also warned that U.S. companies could face inventory shortfalls as a result of tariff-induced supply chain issues. Container bookings from China to the U.S. dropped as much as 60% following the pre-tariff spike in imports according to Flexport, a supply chain management company.",
      "Powell acknowledged at the conference that the economic environment has changed since the Fed's last strategy meeting in 2020, when interest rates were far lower than they are today.",
      "\"Longer-term interest rates are a good deal higher now, driven largely by real rates given the stability of longer-term inflation expectations,\" Powell said on Thursday, referring to interest rates adjust for inflation.",
      "The federal funds rate currently sits at 4.25% to 4.50%. The Fed last week decided to hold that rate steady \u2014 \u00a0a sign it is still weighing the economic risks posed by the Trump administration's tariffs. The central bank is scheduled to meet again in mid-June, where it's expected to maintain its benchmark rate at its current range, according to\u00a0predictions from CME FedWatch.",
      "Inflation volatility",

      "Inflation eased slightly last month\u00a0but is still above the Fed's 2% goal.",
      "Powell's comments come as the American consumers and businesses continue to grapple with economic uncertainty as a result of the Trump administration's stop-and-go tariff policies. Mr. Trump and his team have been meeting with foreign leaders in recent weeks to negotiate deals before the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs lifts in July.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 13:07:32 -0400",
    "summary": "A Republican-backed House bill includes a range new tax breaks, including a $4,000 deduction for seniors. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "As a Republican-backed bill moves ahead in the House, proposed tax cuts under the measure include some new and surprising changes that could impact the wallets of millions of Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of the bill, which would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other reductions.",
      "The extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions would mean that most taxpayers wouldn't see much of a change because their tax brackets would remain at the same levels they've been at since the cuts took effect in 2018. Without an extension, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "Aside from extending the 2017 tax cuts, the proposed bill would provide taxpayers with an average $1,300 tax reduction, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Some of the additional tax cuts include those promised on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, as well as new provisions that would lower taxes for senior citizens and parents.",
      "The proposed bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, aiming to send it to the Senate by Memorial Day. Democratic lawmakers have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid\u00a0and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.",
      "Some Democrats also pointed out that some of the tax cuts promised by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on tips, would expire after 2028, limiting the benefits.",
      "\"[T]hey made provisions like addressing taxes on tips and overtime pay temporary, as opposed to the cuts for the richest 1%, which they made permanent,\" said Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, in a statement.",
      "Still, the bill released Wednesday by the House's tax panel provides a laundry list of tax breaks that could soon become law. Here's what the legislation would do:",
      "Adds a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older",
      "Senior citizens who are 65 and older would get a new tax benefit \u2014 an extra deduction of $4,000 per filer.",
      "The new deduction could be used by people who either itemize or take the standard deduction. But there would be an income limit, with the $4,000 deduction available for people with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 for married couples who file joint returns.",
      "The tax break would be available starting in the current 2025 tax year and extend through 2028.",
      "By contrast, for seniors the latest version of the House bill has one notable omission: There's no plan to eliminate taxes on Social Security income, as Mr. Trump promised in his campaign.",
      "Proposing to scrap income taxes on Social Security proved controversial because those taxes directly fund the retirement program. That would likely hasten the\u00a0insolvency of its trust funds, policy experts have warned.",
      "Increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers",
      "The current standard deduction, which was expanded under the 2017 tax bill, is set to expire on Dec. 31. The House GOP bill would make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's bigger deduction permanent, as well as give it a boost.",
      "Starting in the current 2025 tax year through 2028, here's how the standard deduction would increase:",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000",
      "Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000",
      "Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "The standard deduction reduces your tax liability because it lowers your taxable income by that amount. For instance, single taxpayers earning $50,000 would reduce their taxable income to $34,000 for the 2025 tax year under the proposed standard deduction.",
      "Extends and increases the Child Tax Credit",
      "The House bill also extends the $2,000 Child Tax Credit, which otherwise would revert to its pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of $1,000 per eligible child starting in 2026. That change would be permanent, the House Ways and Means Committee said.",
      "The proposal would also increase the Child Tax Credit to $2,500 per child for the current 2025 tax year through 2028, after which it would drop back to $2,000.",
      "Eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule",
      "The proposed legislation would also abolish a\u00a0controversial rule that would have required payment platforms like Venmo or Paypal to send 1099-K tax forms to anyone receiving over $600.",
      "Previously, such payment services only had to report users' income to the Internal Revenue Service if they had more than 200 transactions, exceeding $20,000 in revenue. The IRS had delayed the implementation of the $600 rule after pushback from some online platforms as well as from Republican lawmakers.",
      "Increases the pass-through deduction for small businesses",
      "The pass-through deduction for small businesses, which was enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also would increase under the House bill.",
      "The deduction allows small businesses, including partnerships, sole proprietorships (who are often gig workers) and S corporations, to subtract 20% of their qualified business income from their taxes, lowering their tax liability. Under the new bill, the deduction would rise to 23%.",
      "Eliminates taxes on tips",
      "This follows Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to eliminate taxes on tipped income, but it would apply only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "The provision would create \"an above-the-line deduction for qualified tips received by an individual in an occupation which traditionally and customarily receives tips during a given taxable year,\" according to a summary of the bill from the House Ways and Means Committee.",
      "Eliminates taxes on overtime pay",
      "Another proposal from Mr. Trump \u2014 to eliminate taxes on eligible workers' overtime pay \u2014 would also become a reality, but only for three years.",
      "Under the House bill, an above-the-line deduction for OT would be created from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Allow car loan interest to be deducted",
      "The House bill would also eliminate taxes on car loan interest by allowing consumers to deduct up to $10,000 for interest paid on vehicle loans.",
      "This would have an income limit, phasing out for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers or $200,000 for married couples. Vehicles must have been assembled in the U.S. to qualify for the deduction.",
      "This tax break would last only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Expanding the estate tax exemption",
      "The estate tax exemption was temporarily doubled under the TCJA, but that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025. In the current tax year, gifts and inheritances of up to almost $14 million for individuals and $28 million for married couples are exempted from federal gift or estate taxes.",
      "Without a change, that threshold will revert to its pre-TCJA level, or about $7 million for an individual.",
      "The new bill would permanently extend the higher estate tax exemption, while boosting it to $15 million for single filers and $30 million for married couples starting in 2026. After that, the exemption would be indexed to inflation.",

      "Ford Motor is recalling 273,789 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition vehicles because of a poorly installed front brake line that may lead to reduced brake function increasing the risk of crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u00a0said in recall dated May 9.",
      "Affected vehicles may have \"a bent brake line\" that could come into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, which is a hose used to transfer filtered air from the car's air filter to it engine. As a result, the outlet pipe may become damaged, resulting in a brake fluid leak, causing the vehicle's front brakes to stop working, recall documents\u00a0state.",
      "\"A brake line leak may cause a longer-than-expected brake pedal travel and result in a reduction in the rate of deceleration. If there is a rapid loss of brake fluid or the brake fluid is completely depleted, this can extend the distance required to stop the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash,\" the NHTSA states in its report.",

      "The cause of the bent brake line stems from faulty assembly during the vehicles' engine installation process at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant. An internal review of plant records conducted by the U.S. carmaker's Critical Concern Review Group earlier this year, discovered that modifications to the engine installation process had been make by the Louisville plant in November in order to prevent damage to the brake line.",
      "\"Through this investigation, Ford's CCRG discovered that Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant (KTP) had modified the radiator hose stowage process during engine decking. This modification was done to prevent the brake line from being bent and was made starting on Nov. 20, 2024 to ensure proper clearances were met,\" the recall documents say.",

      "Homeownership is considered a mainstay of the American dream, but a shortage of affordable homes is blocking that pathway for many middle-income families, according to a new analysis from the National Association of Realtors.",
      "Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income, down from about half of all listings before the pandemic, according to the analysis of property listings in the nation's biggest 100 cities. To get back to that pre-pandemic level of affordable homes, the U.S. would have to add more than 400,000 new listings priced at $255,000 or below, it found.",
      "The median sale price in the first-quarter of 2025 was almost $420,000, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of the price range for middle-class households, said Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director of real estate research at the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The affordability gap has its roots in the housing crisis that started in 2006, which caused new construction to dry up for years afterward, she added.",
      "The lack of affordable homes is partly responsible for driving up prices even higher, as would-be buyers often bid up home prices to secure a property, Evangelou said. The result: More middle-income families are getting shut out of the housing market in many regions.",
      "\"It's discouraging for many people now,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We hear from people who are earning a good income, and still feel homeownership is out of reach.\"",
      "These households represent people in careers such as nursing and teaching and in trades like plumbing, she added. \"The middle-income buyers are the backbone of the housing market, so we need homes they can actually afford,\" Evangelou said.",
      "Where the affordability gap is worst",
      "Twenty-six of the biggest 100 cities have affordability gaps that are worsening, the NAR research found. The cities with the worst affordability gaps are frequently in regions with zoning or permitting restrictions that make it difficult to construct new properties, Evangelou added.",
      "They range from high-cost cities like Los Angeles to more affordable areas like the Harrisburg-Carlisle and Scranton in Pennsylvania, the report found.",
      "Partly because of restrictive zoning rules, Pennsylvania ranked 44th out of all U.S. states in the pace of new housing built from 2017 to 2023, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit foundation that conducts research on areas that shape public policy.",
      "Even though Pennsylvania isn't seeing the same type of population growth as states like Texas or Florida, housing costs in the state have surged due to its lack of building over the past several years, Pew added. The biggest increases were in the state's northeastern region, which includes Scranton and Philadelphia, it noted.",
      "Where housing availability is improving",
      "Thirty cities are showing improvements in affordable listings, including metropolitan areas such as Raleigh-Cary, North Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina, the research found. These areas saw the availability of affordable listings increase by 5% in the last year.",
      "Columbia, for one, has seen an increase in construction, with more properties such as townhomes built in the last few years, according to South Carolina's The State publication.",
      "Another 44 cities are stuck in the middle, neither improving nor decreasing in their share of affordable listings, the NAR analysis found.",
      "Both federal and local initiatives could help spur more homebuilding, helping relieve the affordability crunch in many regions, Evangelou said. For instance, easing zoning and building regulations could encourage more builders to construct new homes, while the federal and state governments could bolster downpayment assistance programs.",
      "Innovative forms of housing could also help, according to new research from Pew Charitable Trusts. For instance, it singled out so-called micro-apartments, which are small, co-living designs where residents share kitchens and bathrooms \u2014 like a college dormitory \u2014 as a low-cost way to provide more housing.",

      "\"Sports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we'll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,\" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement.",
      "Skechers announced that it was being taken private earlier this month by the investment firm by 3G Capital in a transaction worth more than $9 billion.",
      "Foot Locker shareholders can choose to receive either $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick's common stock for each Foot Locker share that they own.",

      "About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs.",
      "Foot Locker offers Dick's a lot of potential, namely its huge real estate footprint, and would give the Pittsburgh company its first foothold overseas.",
      "\"The addition of Foot Locker, with its 4.3% share of the sporting goods market, would produce an immediate boost,\" retail industry analysts Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, said in an email. \"It would also give Dick's substantially more bargaining power with national brands, especially in the sneaker space. As the chains operate in a similar segment there would also likely be scope for synergistic savings.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 18, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And joining us now is Secretary of State Marco Rubio from Rome. Mr. Secretary, you've had a very busy week. I know you have been at the Vatican, and they have offered to host a direct meeting between Ukraine and Russia. Given that Vladimir Putin was a no show at the talks he called for in Istanbul this past week, is there reason to believe that he will take up Pope Leo on the offer?",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think if you saw- again, I'm not a spokesperson for the Kremlin, but if you saw their statements, I believe yesterday, where they said that they would be open to such a meeting under the right conditions. So we'll wait and see if that's possible. Obviously, the Vatican has made a very generous offer to host anything, by the way, not just a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, but any meeting, including at a technical level, you know, any meetings that- that need to be hosted, they- they've expressed a willingness to do so. So it's a very generous offer that may be taken up on. I mean, it would be a site that all parties would feel comfortable. So hopefully we'll get to that stage where- where talks are happening on a regular basis and that the Vatican will have the opportunity to be one of the options.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The Russian Foreign Ministry is saying that you initiated a call to your Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on Saturday. What was that about? Are you talking about lining up that face-to-face meeting between President Putin and President Trump?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, we talked about a variety of things. We did talk about- I wanted to get his readout on his view of how the talks went yesterday. There- they were not a complete waste of time. For example, there were 1,000 prisoners that are going to be exchanged, and that, from a humanitarian standpoint, is very positive. He explained to me that they are going to be pre- preparing a document outlining their requirements for a cease-fire that would then lead to broader negotiations. So obviously, the Ukrainian side is going to be working on their own proposal, and hopefully that will be forthcoming soon. And if that does happen, and the proposal that comes forward from the Russian side and- and for that matter, from the Ukrainian side, are proposals that are serious and viable, then there's been real progress, and we can work off of that. So we'll have to wait and see. But he wanted me to know, and he communicated in our call, that they are- their side will be working on a series of ideas and requirements that they would have in order to move forward with a cease-fire and further negotiations. So we'll await that, and hopefully it's one- it's a document that is close enough to what the Ukrainians want to be able to get to that point and maybe work out those differences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You've said repeatedly it's just a matter of days, though, in terms of the waning patience that the U.S. has for this diplomacy to succeed. So are- are they just tapping you along, as President Trump has said? Are they just seeking to talk- Are they just seeking to continue to talk to buy time?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Well, that's what we're testing. And that's what we'll know. Look, at the end of the day what I've said, and it's happening now, we're no longer flying all over the world trying to set up meetings. We're responding to meetings that are set up and we're willing- we always said we're willing to do whatever it takes to bring them together if the opportunities present themselves. So I think your question is, are they tapping us along? Well, that's what we're trying to find out. We'll find out pretty soon. They met last- yesterday or the day before in Turkey. From that they agreed they're going to exchange paper on ideas that get to a cease-fire. If those papers have ideas on them that are realistic and rational, then I think we know we've made progress. If those papers, on the other hand, have requirements in them that we know are unrealistic, then we'll have a different assessment. So, we're going to try to find that out. And there's a combination here. On the one hand, we're trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war. So there's some element of patience that is required. On the other hand, we don't have time to waste. There are a lot of other things happening in the world that we also need to be paying attention to. So we don't want to be involved in this process of just endless talks, there has to be some progress, some movement forward. And if at the end of this, in the next few days, we get a document produced by both sides, and it shows that both sides are being- making concessions and being realistic and rational in their approach, then I think we can feel good about continuing to remain engaged. If, on the other hand, what we see is not very productive, perhaps we'll have a different assessment. I also agree that ultimately, one of the things that could help break this log jam, perhaps the only thing that can, is a direct- direct conversation between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. And he's already openly expressed a desire and a belief that that needs to happen, and- and hopefully that'll be worked out soon as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0You're planning on that?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Well, I don't know. We're- we're certainly made the offer. The president's made that offer already publicly. The mechanics of setting that kind of meeting up would require a little bit of work, so I can't say that's being planned as we speak in terms of picking a site and a date. But the president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as- as feasible. I think the Russian side has also expressed a willingness to do it. And so, now it's just a question of bringing them- bringing everyone together, and figuring out where and when and that meeting will happen and what it will be about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah, I- I want to move on to other topics. But lastly, your- your Senate- former senate colleague, Lindsey Graham, was next to you in that meeting with the Ukrainian foreign minister. He has a- he has a veto-proof majority on this bill to put sanctions on Russia. How quickly do you want the option for more sanctions on Russia? Or are you asking him to wait?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 No, we're not- look, the Senate is going to act, ultimately. I mean, I think in the past, we've act- asked to give us a little time to see if we can make some progress on our talks. But we've also been pretty clear with the Russian side for weeks now, going back six or seven weeks. We've been communicating to the Russian side that this effort was- was being undertaken. That we anticipated that when all was said and done, it would have close to 80 cosponsors in the Senate, and I imagine a comparable percentage of support in the House, that that was an effort we couldn't stop and don't control, that ultimately, Congress and particularly the Republicans in the House and Senate, have tried to give the president space and time to negotiate something here. But we've- we've advised the Russians repeatedly now for almost two months that this was coming if no progress was made. So I think that's just coming to fruition now. And it's one of the- one of the things that I confirmed, again, being with Lindsey Graham this week in Turkey, is they're now up to 77. He thinks they could get close to 80 or more. And that's just- that's just a fact, and something we've told the Russians about for weeks was coming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move on to another part of the world. You've been very involved in the administration's efforts to crack down on this Venezuelan gang, TdA, that has been designated as a terror group by the U.S. Do you accept the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang is not a proxy force of the Maduro government? That was the National Intelligence Council assessment.",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Yeah, that's their assessment. They're wrong. In fact, the FBI agrees with me that they are. We- we- the FBI agrees that not only is Tren de Aragua exported by the Venezuelan regime, but in fact, if you go back and see a Tren de Aragua member, all the evidence is there, and it's growing every day, was actually contracted to murder an opposition member, I believe, in Chile a few months ago. So one of the warnings out there by the FBI is not simply that Tren de Aragua are- are a terrorist organization, but one that has already been operationalized, to murder a- to murder a- an- an opposition member in another country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's a different thing than being a proxy force controlled by the Maduro government. Part of this is at the heart of the legal arguments the administration is having over its ability to continue to deport suspected gang members. That's why this assessment is so key. You completely reject that intelligence--",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 There- there--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --community finding?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Yeah, I agree 100 percent with the FBI's finding. This is a prison gang that the Venezuelan government has actively encouraged to leave the country. A prison gang that, in some cases, they've been in cooperation- and by the way, Tren de Aragua members that have been returned to Venezuela on some of these planes that have gone back have been greeted like heroes at the airport. So we have no doubt, I have no doubt and the FBI has made clear, I mean, this is the gang that they hired in order to- to murder an opposition member in another country. So they- they- there's no doubt in our mind, and in my mind, and in the FBI's assessment that this is a group that the regime in Venezuela uses, not just to try to destabilize the United States, but to project power, like they did by murdering a member of the opposition in Chile.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 South Africa's president is traveling to the United States this week to meet with President Trump. The administration has prioritized bringing some white South Africans, Afrikaners, to the United States, despite the increased restrictions on refugees. President Trump claims there's a genocide underway in South Africa. That's a legal determination, the State Department would make it. Are you trying to determine that now?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: I would determine that these people are having their properties taken from them. You can- they can call it whatever they want, but these are people that, on the basis of their race, are having their properties taken away from them, and their lives being threatened and, in some cases, killed. These are people that applied and made these claims in their applications and seek to come to the United States in search of- of refuge. I- we've often been lectured by people all over the place about how the United States needs to continue to be a beacon for those who are oppressed abroad. Well, here's an example where we're doing that. So I don't understand why people are criticizing it. I think people should be celebrating it, and I think people should be supporting it--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well is there evidence--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: If in fact as many claim, they are in favor--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --of a genocide that you have?",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "SEC. RUBIO: I think there's evidence, absolutely, that people have been murdered, that people have been forcibly removed from their properties, both by the government, in some cases because of a law they passed, but also because of independent groups encouraged by political parties inside of South- inside of South Africa. So, listen, to move here from half a world away and leave behind the only homeland you've ever known, that's not something people do lightly--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --especially people who have spent generations farming their land and developing their property. That's not something that you take lightly and do. These people are doing it for a reason. So we welcome them to the United States, and I think there may be more coming soon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We will stand by to see if that determination of genocide is made. I want to ask you about the Middle East. The president says he wants to end wars, but Israel's prime minister has said he is expanding this ground operation inside of Gaza, the IDF says is to seize strategic areas. Does the U.S. fully support expanding this war?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 We expand the destruction of Hamas, the ending of Hamas. We support a future for the people of Gaza that is free of Hamas and full of opportunity. That's what we support. And this is a group that came across on October 7 and carried out one of the most vile series of attacks, kidnappings, rapes, murders and hostage taking that we've ever seen. That's what we support. Now that said, we also support an end of the conflict, a cease-fire. We don't want people obviously suffering as they have, and we blame Hamas for that, but nonetheless, they're suffering. And so we are actively engaged, even as I speak to you now, we are actively engaged in trying to figure out if there is a way to get more hostages out through some cease-fire type mechanism. We're not going to do anything to undermine Israel and its security, but by the same token, if there is a possibility here to find a way forward that frees more hostages, including those who are alive, but also the bodies to their relatives, and potentially bring about an end to this war in a way that puts the people of Gaza on a pathway of peace and prosperity and being free of Hamas, we're going to explore that. We think we've made some progress, but there's more work to be done. Ambassador Witkoff is working on that on an hourly basis. It's something we're all very focused on and continue to be very supportive of. And I hope we'll have good news soon in that regard, but I think some impediments remain.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you asking Israel to slow down this military push? And the Qatari prime minister told Fox News that there was a deal being put together for all hostages, or many hostages, to be released after Edan Alexander, that American-Israeli was released recently, but then the Israeli military bombed a hospital, killing 70 civilians, and everything went sideways. Is that your understanding of what happened--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I would say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --it was this lack of care of collateral damage?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 No, I- the way I would characterize it is that this war could end immediately. And Israel's made that clear, it can end immediately if Hamas surrenders and gives up their weapons and demilitarizes and releases all the hostages, including the deceased ones. If they did that, this conflict would end. That's been true from the very beginning. It's been true for months now. They're the ones that have chosen not to accept that offer. That said, we continue to work and do everything we can through diplomatic channels and private means to bring about an end to this conflict in a way that ends Hamas and provides the people of Gaza the opportunity at a prosperous and peaceful future that also ensures Israel's security. So we're working on that, and we've never stopped working on that. We've never stopped taking efforts to make that possible. And that continues. Even as I speak to you now, there are people working on that. So we're going to continue to do that and that's the outcome we want to see. And hopefully, the sooner the better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, the president has said Prime Minister Netanyahu didn't want to end the war. So the views are quite--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I think what the--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --in contrast.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Yeah- no- what the president's- no, no. I think what the president is saying is he doesn't want to end the war until Hamas is defeated. This is a group that is a threat- if an ember survives, it will spark again into a fire. And that is the view of- there is no future. There can be no peaceful and prosperous Gaza as long as Hamas governs it by rule of arms. And that's a- that's a fundamental truth. Now that doesn't mean that there isn't some way that we can achieve that through a cease-fire and some peace mechanism, and that's what we're trying to accomplish here. Ending Hamas, ending its governance of Gaza, ending the conflict, freeing all of the hostages, including the bodies of those who have passed away and been killed and murdered by the Hamas terrorists, and then beginning the work of a future for Gaza and also of ensuring Israel's security. That's always been our goal. That remains our goal, and that's what we continue to be focused on. But in the absence of that such agreement, we anticipate that, you know, Israel will continue forward with their operations. But that doesn't mean we stopped working on trying to achieve a peaceful outcome that also protects Israel's security and ends Hamas's governance of Gaza, so that Gaza can have a free and prosperous future moving forward. That's what the president wants to see as the end goal here. That is the end goal, and that's what we're working on through every means at our disposal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have said that Iran is, in your view, a threshold nuclear state, and we're at a critical moment. The U.S. and Iran are talking again. Can you clarify what the U.S. policy is here? Is the bottom line that Iran cannot enrich any uranium, even if it is at low levels for civilian purposes? Do they need to fully dismantle the program?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, look, if you're able to enrich at any level you've now are basically able to enrich at weapons grade very quickly. I mean, that's just a fundamental fact, and everyone knows it, and that was the problem with the Obama deal. But the end goal here is simple, Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. And the president's preference, because he doesn't like war, the president's preference is to achieve that through a peaceful negotiation. In fact, the president's preference is not- not only that Iran not pursue nuclear weapons, but that Iran be a rich, peaceful and prosperous country where its people can be happy. He wants them to have a better future. He has said this, he's a builder, not a bomber. That's what he views himself as, and that's what he is. He's a president that wants peace, and so he's offered that route, and that's one we hope the Iranians will take. But he's been very clear, Iran is never going to have the capability. They're never going to have a nuclear weapon. It's not going to happen. And we hope that that is achieved, that outcome is achieved through peaceful, diplomatic means, and that's what we're engaged on. We're not going to negotiate it in the media, because it makes it difficult to get an outcome. But that is the ultimate goal here, is to have an Iran that does not have a nuclear weapon or the ability to threaten its neighbors, particularly Israel.",

    "published": "Sat, 17 May 2025 14:38:27 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced this week he will drop sanctions on Syria \u2014 surprising some senior U.S. sanctions officials, sources tell CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For the leaders of Syria's transitional government, President Trump's announcement earlier this week that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country came as a relief after months of intense lobbying for a reprieve.",
      "\"I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\" Mr. Trump said at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday.",
      "But inside the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy, the announcement came as a surprise to senior officials, sources tell CBS News.",
      "The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant.",
      "Now, there are discussions inside Treasury to determine the speed and extent to which the decades-old sanctions \u2014 which restrict economic activity within Syria and its dealings with other countries \u2014 can be rolled back.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said Friday, \"President Trump is the Commander-in-Chief and the Treasury Department is in lockstep to execute his historic vision to bring peace and stability back to the Middle East.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was traveling with the president, was aware of the announcement and part of the decision-making process.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that he was with Mr. Trump when he decided to include the announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria in his speech in Riyadh. Rubio did not say when the president made the decision.",
      "\"This is something that had been discussed, worked on, options considered for many weeks leading up to this announcement and that we are going to be implementing what the president has announced as an administration,\" State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.",
      "Indeed, Syria's transitional government \u2014 led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa \u2014 has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief in recent months.",
      "The new government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for its inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.-designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion.",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration led an international effort to isolate Syria \u2014 culminating in multiple rounds of sanctions \u2014 as Assad's army fought a bloody civil war against rebel forces that led to half a million dead Syrians.",
      "Another package of sanctions was imposed in 2019 as part of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, also known as the \"Caesar Act\" which Mr. Trump signed into law. The bill imposed stiff sanctions on Assad's government and companies or governments that worked with it, further crippling Syria's already isolated economy.",
      "Rubio indicated in his remarks in Turkey that relief may come in the form of waivers that give permission to do business in Syria without facing penalties for evading sanctions, which the administration can issue under authorities in the \"Caesar Act.\"",
      "\"I think we want to start with the initial waiver, which will allow foreign partners who wanted to flow in aid to begin to do so without running the risk of sanctions,\" Rubio said. He also suggested that the Trump Administration may be in a position \"soon\" to ask lawmakers to permanently repeal some sanctions."

    "summary": "Patriot Front and other white nationalist groups are fueling the expansion of extremist groups in the U.S., and control at least a dozen clubs nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "Combat sport clubs have been used to boost recruitment for a white nationalist hate group, according to a report released by the legal advocacy organization Southern Poverty Law Center.",
      "The report tracks the efforts of the Patriot Front \u2014 one of the most visible groups in the white nationalist movement, formed following the deadly 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 \u2014 and their focus on recruiting new members through Active Clubs.",
      "These clubs are smaller, looser networks of white supremacist groups, where members train in mixed martial arts. Through sport, they bond over white nationalist ideologies, SPLC said. The clubs also maintain a robust online presence to encourage young men to become radicalized. Patriot Front is using these groups to expand their reach while maintaining a low profile, the\u00a0report\u00a0said, to evade researchers and law enforcement.",
      "\"It serves as a way to hide some of the Patriot Front's movements,\" said Jeff Tischauser, the SPLC report's author and a researcher at the not-for-profit legal advocacy organization.",
      "Patriot Front and other white nationalist groups are fueling the expansion of extremist groups in the U.S. \u2013 and control at least a dozen clubs nationwide. Since 2023, there has been a\u00a014% increase\u00a0in hate groups, according to the SPLC, which says it tracks 1,430 hate and antigovernment groups across the country.",
      "Active Clubs have had a presence since 2023 in at least 34 states, including Arizona, California, Ohio, Kansas, Montana, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Florida,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Counter Extremism Project. The groups host training sessions, create propaganda videos and participate in demonstrations and flash rallies, according to experts. They push male supremacy ideology, share workout selfies and encourage each other to reach peak physicality in preparation for marches or possible future conflicts, experts say.",
      "Robert Rundo, the founder of a white supremacist group based in Southern California, is credited with introducing the idea of Active Clubs, according to the Anti-Defamation League. In 2021, Rundo began hosting a podcast called \"Active Club Podcast,\" where he and his co-host encouraged listeners to establish their own clubs. He hawked what he called \"white nationalism 3.0\" \u2014 a more local, decentralized approach to the white nationalist movement.",
      "Rundo was arrested in Romania in 2023 after the U.S. requested his extradition on federal rioting charges. He was sentenced to two years and effectively received a time-served sentence, being released in December 2024.",
      "The shift to \"white nationalism 3.0\" is similar to leaderless resistance concepts across the far right ecosystem, said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.",
      "\"I think a lot of these groups really function more like brands,\" he said.",
      "Audio messages and a leaked internal memo obtained by the SPLC confirmed direct affiliations between Patriot Front and certain Active Clubs. The founder of a Texas active club was berated for recruiting \"non-European\" members.",
      "\"Is our organization something you are totally committed to, or are you going to be the active club guy doing your own thing?\" The Patriot Front member asked, according to the SPLC report.",
      "The new recruitment method has coincided with Patriot Front's faltering brand, the SPLC says, after years of controversies stemming from various lawsuits and acts of vandalism. In January, Patriot Front was\u00a0ordered to pay\u00a0$2.7 million in damages to a Black musician the group attacked during a march in Boston in 2022. In February, a\u00a0settlement\u00a0was reached between Patriot Front and two North Dakota nonprofits over allegations that the group intimidated immigrant business owners.",
      "Patriot Front has also faced scrutiny from within the right-wing movement. \"In some sections of this larger far right, Patriot Front is branded as federal agents,\" Tischauser said. \"So to avoid that accusation, they use Active Clubs and start trying to groom people into Patriot Front membership from there.\"",
      "The conspiracy theory even gained enough traction on social media to reach Elon Musk. Last year, he posted on\u00a0X, \"This does seem odd. Why no mask removal after arrest?\" in reaction to a post of Patriot Front members being detained, where an X user dubbed the group \"Fed Front.\"",
      "The conspiracy that FBI agents pose as right-wing activists goes beyond Patriot Front. A Washington Post-University of Maryland\u00a0poll\u00a0found that a quarter of Americans believe the FBI instigated the\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The FBI said in a statement to CBS News Saturday, \"The FBI investigates individuals who commit or intend to commit violence and other criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security. Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on criminal activity.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Patriot Front's founder and leader, Thomas Rosseau, via email.",
      "Lewis said that there has been a mainstreaming of conspiracy theories and hateful beliefs once confined to neo-Nazi forums and considered to be fringe.",
      "\"Today, you have the richest man in the world,\u00a0members of Congress\u00a0tweeting this out, as if it's like a real thing that's happening,\" Lewis said. \"That just broadens out the aperture of disaffected young, predominantly white men who are looking for someone to blame, something to blame.\"",
      "Since these clubs are scattered, unaffiliated entities, Patriot Front has faced challenges in its recruitment efforts.",

      "President Trump ripped into Walmart, saying on social media Saturday that the retail giant should \"eat the tariffs\" instead of blaming the duties on imported goods imposed by his administration for its increased prices.",
      "Walmart on Thursday warned that everything from bananas to children's car seats could increase in price despite the softer tariffs on China.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first quarter earnings call Thursday. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",
      "The price hikes are expected to go into effect later this month.",
      "As Mr. Trump has jacked up import taxes, he has tried to assure a skeptical public that foreign producers would pay for those taxes and that retailers and automakers would absorb the additional expenses.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday, the president lashed out at Walmart \u2013 which employs some 1.6 million people in the United States \u2013 and said the company should sacrifice its profits for the sake of his economic agenda. Mr. Trump says his economic plan will eventually lead to more domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "\"Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,\" Trump posted. \"Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, \"EAT THE TARIFFS,\" and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I'll be watching, and so will your customers!!!\"",
      "A spokesperson for Walmart told CBS News on Saturday that it has always worked to keep prices as low as possible and \"we won't stop.\"",
      "\"We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The threat by the Republican president reflected the increasingly awkward series of choices that many major American companies face as a result of his tariffs, from deteriorating sales to the possibility of incurring Mr. Trump's wrath. Mr. Trump has similarly warned domestic automakers not to raise their prices, even though outside analyses say his tariffs would raise production costs.",
      "In April, McMillon was among the retail executives who met with Mr. Trump at the White House to discuss tariffs and potential negative outcomes. But the Trump administration went forward despite warnings and has attacked other companies, such as Amazon and Apple, that are struggling with the disruptions to their supply chains.",
      "Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey said he thinks $350 car seats made in China will soon cost an additional $100, a 29% price increase.",
      "\"We're wired to keep prices low, but there's a limit to what we can bear, or any retailer for that matter,\" he told The Associated Press on Thursday after the company reported strong first-quarter sales.",
      "Many U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of tariffs, as consumers curtail spending.",
      "The administration recently ratcheted down its 145% tariffs on China to 30% for a 90-day period. Trump has placed tariffs as high as 25% on Mexico and Canada due to illegal immigration and drug trafficking, harming the relationship with America's two largest trading partners.",
      "There is a universal baseline tariff of 10% for most countries as Trump promises to reach trade deals in the coming weeks, all while insisting he intends to preserve the tariffs as a revenue source. The framework agreement with the United Kingdom would largely keep the 10% tariff rate in place.",

      "Snippets from a 2023 interview that led Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur to describe former President Joe Biden as an \"elderly man with a poor memory\" were obtained and published by Axios Friday, showing Biden's halting tone of voice and difficulty remembering dates.",
      "CBS News has confirmed the audio matches the transcript of the interview released by the Biden White House in 2024.",
      "In one four-minute clip, Biden was asked by Hur's team \u2014 which was investigating Biden's handling of classified records \u2014 about where he kept his documents shortly after leaving office as vice president. Biden's response is marked by long pauses, and his voice appears hoarse at times. His speech is especially halting as he describes the period around his son Beau's death.",
      "In the audio obtained by news outlet Axios, Biden can also be heard struggling to remember the year when Beau died or the year when President Trump was first elected. Members of his staff can be heard correcting him or reminding him of the date.",
      "A written transcript of the five-hour interview was released last year, but portions of the audio released Friday provide context on Biden's demeanor and memory problems at certain points in the session.",
      "In response to the audio, Biden spokesperson Kelly Scully told CBS News in a statement, \"The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago. The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.\"",
      "Biden's verbal delivery was a key part of Hur's report. The special counsel wrote in February 2024 that Biden sounded like a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Hur said it's a view jurors may share, making it hard to convict Biden of knowingly holding sensitive documents at his home and office. Hur's report noted \"significant limitations\" to Biden's memory, including his difficulty remembering when his son died.",
      "Hur recommended against charging Biden with a crime, though he did conclude that Biden \"willfully\" retained government documents.",
      "At the time, Biden and his allies reacted furiously to Hur's report \u2014 especially the \"elderly man with a poor memory\" line and the comment about Beau Biden's death.",
      "\"There's even a reference that I don't remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn't any of their damn business,\" Biden said last year. \"I don't need anyone to tell me when he passed away.\"",
      "Biden's personal attorney Bob Bauer called the report a \"shabby piece of work\" filled with \"totally inappropriate and pejorative comments.\" The Biden White House counsel's office asked Hur's team to revise the report, calling its references to Biden's memory \"inflammatory.\"",
      "The report was released as concerns swirled about Biden's age and fitness to run for another term, though at the time, Democratic officials publicly backed Biden and slammed Hur. Republicans, meanwhile, cited the report as evidence of Biden's fading cognitive abilities and pushed for audio of the interview to be released. Biden was 80 years old at the time of Hur's interview.",
      "But months later, Biden's rocky June debate against Mr. Trump \u2014 in which he repeatedly struggled to complete his sentences \u2014 reignited worries about his age, leading to Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race amid pressure from his party.",
      "Biden's decisions during that period have drawn new scrutiny in recent weeks, as books that offer glimpses inside his campaign hit the shelves. Some of the books describe Biden's struggles with age, his aides' maneuvers to keep him in the race and the abrupt shift from Biden to eventual nominee Kamala Harris weeks after the Trump-Biden debate.",

      "President Trump suggested Friday his swipe at Taylor Swift last year has hurt her popularity.",
      "\"Has anyone noticed that, since I said 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer 'HOT?',\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post Friday, as he flew back from the Middle East to the U.S. after the first major overseas trip of his second term.",
      "A White House official told CBS News: \"As a business and entertainment mogul President Trump is highly qualified to comment on the rise and fall of various celebrities,\" including Swift.",
      "Mr. Trump posted \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" last fall, days after the singer endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris. Swift's Eras tour was still in progress at the time. The post was quickly overshadowed by news of a second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump hours later.",
      "It wasn't clear what prompted Mr. Trump's mid-air musing about Swift. The pop megastar has been keeping a lower public profile in recent weeks. Her Eras tour has ended, and boyfriend Travis Kelce's football season is over. Swift fans caught a glimpse of her at a Mother's Day brunch in Philadelphia with the Kelce family, but she's been photographed less frequently, except for the occasional date night, since the Kansas City Chiefs lost their Super Bowl bid.",

      "The president's digs at Swift and Springsteen came at the tail end of a four-day tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. During the trip, Mr. Trump met with allied Arab leaders, pledged to drop sanctions against Syria in a surprise move and announced a set of economic deals with Gulf states. Shortly before the trip started, reports emerged that Qatar would donate a Boeing 747 for Mr. Trump's use, drawing ethics concerns \u2014 though Mr. Trump defended the move.",
      "The bad blood between Swift and the president extends back years. Swift has only occasionally waded into politics, but has endorsed Mr. Trump's opponents twice, backing former President Joe Biden in 2020 and Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. Last year, she suggested she endorsed Harris in part because Mr. Trump had shared images on Truth Social that implied Swift supported him.",
      "In endorsing Harris, Swift said she was \"a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\"",
      "Swift also endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen in his unsuccessful 2018 race against Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, whom Swift called \"Trump in a wig\" in a documentary released in early 2020.",
      "Mr. Trump responded to the 2018 endorsement by saying, \"I like Taylor's music about 25% less now,\" adding that Swift \"doesn't know anything about\" Blackburn.",
      "Mr. Trump called Swift \"unusually beautiful\" and said, \"I hear she's very talented\" in a 2023 interview with Variety editor Ramin Setoodeh \u2014 but questioned her stated political views.",
      "\"She's legitimately liberal? It's not an act? It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal,\" Mr. Trump said of the crossover star to Setoodeh, according to excerpts published by Variety last year.",

    "summary": "The nation's disaster relief agency \u2014 rocked by staff cuts and a push for its elimination by President Trump \u2014 is \"not ready\" for hurricane season, which starts in just two weeks, an internal review said.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency is \"not ready\" for hurricane season in June, according to an internal review obtained by CBS News\u2014 as FEMA contends with staff cuts and a push by President Trump to eliminate the nation's disaster relief agency.",
      "The powerpoint presentation was created after FEMA's new acting leader, David Richardson, ordered the agency to review hurricane preparedness, with storm season roughly two weeks away. In a series of slides, dated May 12, FEMA identified apparent problems at the disaster relief agency, including a need to \"refocus on its core mission while preparing for the 2025 Hurricane Season.\"",
      "\"As FEMA transforms to a smaller footprint, the intent for this hurricane season is not well understood, thus FEMA is not ready,\" said one of the slides.",
      "Elsewhere in the presentation, it says most of FEMA's readiness process for hurricane season \"has been derailed this year due to other activities like staffing and contracts\" \u2014 an apparent reference to layoffs of probationary workers and sweeping changes to FEMA's contract workforce.",
      "\"It has not been normal hurricane season preparedness yet,\" the slides read.",
      "CNN was first to report on the internal document.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an official at the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 which oversees FEMA \u2014 called the story \"grossly out of context\" and said FEMA is \"fully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season.\" The DHS official described the review's comments on hurricane season as \"one line in a nineteen-page slide deck and the unsubstantiated opinion of one official inside the agency.\"",
      "\"The slide was used during a daily meeting Acting Administrator David Richardson has held every day titled Hurricane Readiness Complex Problem Solving. In other words, exactly what the head of an emergency management agency should be doing before Hurricane Season,\" the statement read.",
      "In a 30-minute town hall meeting with staff Thursday, Richardson would not say whether the agency is ready for hurricane season when asked, according to multiple FEMA employees. Richardson, who has been on the job for less than a week, responded that he's still working on it and should have a better idea within a couple of weeks.",
      "The official start of Atlantic hurricane season is June 1.",
      "The internal presentation also cites \"culture issues,\" staffing shortages and challenges coordinating with other federal agencies.",
      "Parts of the document seem to reference Mr. Trump's plan to shift more emergency response duties to the states. The slides say there's a perception that state officials are \"passing [the] buck\" to FEMA, and cite the need for \"managing expectations and understanding what FEMA's role is\" \u2014 suggesting the federal agency should offer \"supplemental assistance\" in some cases.",
      "During Thursday's town hall, Richardson cited California and Texas as examples of states that are capable of responding to their own natural disasters, multiple FEMA employees said. The comment raised eyebrows among several FEMA staff members who deployed to Texas' deadly winter cold snap in February 2021, causing hundreds of thousands to lose power.",
      "FEMA has faced a turbulent few months as it prepares for the Atlantic hurricane season. Mr. Trump has criticized the agency's handling of prior natural disasters, and has floated either scrapping FEMA or transforming it into a \"support agency\" that largely defers to the states.",
      "The agency laid off hundreds of probationary employees earlier this year. And in March, the agency indicated a large share of its workforce would be required to apply for contract extensions through DHS. The move could impact more than half of FEMA's workers, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "The agency's former acting head, Cameron Hamilton, was fired by the Trump administration last week and replaced by Richardson after Hamilton told lawmakers he doesn't believe eliminating FEMA is in the country's \"best interests\" \u2014 clashing with Mr. Trump's views.",
      "In his first all-hands meeting last week, Richardson told staff, \"Don't get in my way\u2026 I will run right over you,\" according to a recording obtained by CBS News.",
      "Richardson, a former Marine who attained the rank of lieutenant colonel, backed Mr. Trump's plan to shrink FEMA, and said he plans on looking for ways to \"push things down to the states\" and \"do more cost sharing with the states.\"",
      "\"I am as bent on achieving the President's intent as I was on making sure that I did my duty, where I took my Marines to Iraq, eleven of them,\" he said at last week's meeting.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's domestic policy bill hit a major snag on Friday after conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee.",
      "Republicans have yet to resolve several disputes that have threatened to derail what Mr. Trump calls his \"big, beautiful bill\" as more conservative members and blue-state Republicans dig in on their demands.",
      "Five Republicans \u2014 Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma and Andrew Clyde of Georgia \u2014 voted against advancing the legislation on Friday when the Budget Committee met to merge the various parts of the reconciliation package\u00a0that have been produced by other committees into a single bill.",
      "Conservatives said the legislation does not go far enough to slash federal spending. Among the demands conservative members have made are moving up the work requirements for Medicaid recipients without disabilities and children. The requirements would not set in until 2029 under the current bill and conservatives want them to kick in as soon as the legislation becomes law.",
      "\"This bill falls profoundly short. It does not do what we say it does with respect to deficits,\" Roy said during the meeting, adding that \"this bill has back-loaded savings and has front-loaded spending.\"",
      "Clyde also said the bill \"falls short\" and \"substantive improvements are needed.\"",
      "\"Sadly, I'm a hard no until we get this ironed out,\" Norman said.",
      "Smucker, who changed his vote at the last second, said he supports the bill but voted \"no\" to be able to bring up the legislation for another vote. The committee plans to return late Sunday to vote again.",
      "Rep. Jodey Arrington of Texas, the Republican chairman of the committee, defended his decision to move forward with Friday's meeting despite warnings from conservatives that it lacked enough support, saying \"you can't accomplish anything in life without having deadlines and decisions.\"",
      "\"Their hearts are in the right place. Their motives are pure. I share their convictions, and I share their desired outcomes of changing some of these policies and making the bill better. This is not the right venue to do it,\" Arrington said Friday afternoon after meeting with the holdouts.",
      "The Budget Committee can't make any changes to the bill, but it could still be updated if it comes before the Rules Committee. The plan was for the Rules Committee to meet Monday to tee it up for a floor vote later next week if it advanced out of the Budget Committee Friday.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has remained committed to putting the legislation, which would extend tax cuts from Mr. Trump's first term while temporarily enacting new ones, on the floor before Memorial Day despite the disagreements between some factions in his party. The tax measures, as well as increased spending on the military and border security, would be offset partly by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy subsidies.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, Scalise that they are considering moving up the effective date for the work requirements to get more members on board with the final product, but added that the final details have not been worked out.",
      "\"We're all in agreement on the reforms we want to make,\" Scalise said. \"We want to have work requirements. We want to phase out a lot of these green subsidies. How quickly can you get that done? It's not as quickly as saying, you just turn it off tomorrow.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a group of Republicans from blue states have threatened to withhold their support in a floor vote if the bill does not raise a cap on state and local taxes that can be written off on federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000, but several New York Republicans have insisted on raising it even further.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, on Thursday called the cap \"unacceptable\" and said the group has made clear to leadership that \"none of us are going to support that as it currently stands.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who is on his way back from the Middle East, called on Republicans to unite behind the bill. Scalise said Mr. Trump had been following the issue closely.",
      "\"We don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!\" Mr. Trump wrote Friday as the Budget Committee meeting was underway.",
      "Johnson spent Thursday meeting with the opposing factions and said they would continue to negotiate through the weekend to resolve the remaining differences. He can afford just three defections, if all members are voting, in a floor vote.",

    "story": [
      "Former FBI Director James Comey has provoked an outcry from the Trump administration after he briefly posted a photo to Instagram that federal officials alleged was a call for violence against President Trump \u2014 a claim Comey pushed back on.",
      "Comey was interviewed Friday by Secret Service agents investigating the post at their field office in Washington, D.C., two officials familiar with the matter told CBS News. The interview wrapped at approximately 7 p.m. ET, roughly 90 minutes after it was slated to begin, two sources familiar said.",
      "The image shared by Comey \u2014 a longtime Trump foe \u2014 showed seashells in sand arranged to form the numbers \"86 47,\" according to screenshots shared by Trump administration officials.",
      "He did not make his meaning clear, but administration officials and some of his supporters interpreted the numbers as referring to Mr. Trump's status as the 47th president and the slang term \"eighty-six,\" which has often been used to mean \"eject\" or \"remove.\"",
      "Comey later deleted the image. In a follow-up Instagram post Thursday night, Comey wrote that he \"posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message. I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Comey's attorneys for comment about the post.",
      "Noem says post is under investigation",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X\u00a0Thursday that the issue is under investigation. She said Comey \"just called for the assassination\" of Mr. Trump, and added her agency and the Secret Service are \"investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.\"",
      "In a post Friday night on X, Noem confirmed that Secret Service agents had interviewed Comey, writing, in part: \"I will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of @POTUS Trump. This is an ongoing investigation.\"",
      "Current FBI Director Kash Patel said in a separate statement that, \"We are aware of the recent tweet by former FBI Director James Comey, directed at President Trump. We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director (Sean) Curran. Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.\"",
      "A Secret Service spokesperson told CBS News in a statement Thursday it \"vigorously investigates anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees. We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI Director and we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich wrote in his own social media post Comey's message \"can clearly be interpreted as 'a hit' on the sitting President of the United States,\" and said it is \"being taken seriously.\"",
      "Trump responds",
      "In an interview with Fox News, the president claimed Comey knew \"exactly what that meant\" when he posted the image on Instagram. \"That meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear,\" Mr. Trump told Fox's Bret Baier. He also called the post \"a terrible thing\" and Comey a \"dirty cop.\"",
      "When asked what the response to Comey's post should be, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't want to take a position on it because that's going to be up to Pam and all of the great people,\" referring to Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "Comey and Mr. Trump have sparred for years. Comey served as FBI director from 2013 until he was fired by Mr. Trump in 2017, during the president's first White House term.",
      "That firing ultimately set into motion Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a \"hoax.\"",
      "For his part, Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump since his firing, calling him \"morally unfit\" to be president in a 2018 interview.",
      "Mr. Trump was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidential campaign last year. During a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a 20-year-old gunman opened fire on Mr. Trump, grazing his ear with a bullet. One rally attendee was killed and two more were wounded.",
      "On Sept. 14, a man was arrested on allegations he attempted to assassinate Mr. Trump at his golf course in West Palm Beach by aiming a rifle through shrubbery.",
      "What does \"86 47\" mean?",
      "It's unclear what Comey meant with his Instagram post, but according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, to \"eighty-six\" means to \"throw out\" or \"get rid of\" something.",
      "It originates from 1930s soda counter slang, which meant that an item was sold out, Merriam-Webster says. The term can also refer to people: To \"Eighty-six\" an inebriated bar patron is to kick them out or refuse service to them, the dictionary said.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 18:37:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

    "story": [
      "A pregnant woman in Georgia who was declared brain dead after a medical emergency has been on life support for three months to let the fetus grow enough to be delivered, a move her family says a hospital told them was required under the state's strict anti-abortion law.",
      "With her due date still more than three months away, it could be one of the longest such pregnancies. Her family is upset that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected, doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support.",
      "Georgia's\u00a0\"heartbeat law\" is among the restrictive abortion statutes that have been put in place in many conservative states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade\u00a0three years ago.",
      "Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old mother and nurse, was declared brain-dead - meaning she is legally dead - in February, her mother, April Newkirk, told Atlanta TV station WXIA.",
      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than three months ago and went to Atlanta's Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain-dead.",
      "Newkirk said Smith is now 21 weeks pregnant. Removing breathing tubes and other life-saving devices would likely kill the fetus.",
      "A spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said in a statement to CBS News on Friday, \"There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death.\"",
      "\"Removing life support is not an action 'with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,'\" the spokesperson said, quoting part of the law.",
      "Gov. Brian Kemp's office declined to comment on Smith's case and referred CBS News to the statement from the attorney general's spokesperson.",
      "Northside did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Emory Healthcare said it could not comment on an individual case because of privacy rules, but released a statement saying it \"uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia's abortion laws and all other applicable laws. Our top priorities continue to be the safety and well-being of the patients we serve.\"",
      "Smith's family says Emory doctors have told them they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 generally around six weeks into pregnancy.",
      "The law was adopted in 2019 but not enforced until after Roe v. Wade\u00a0was overturned in the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling, opening the door to state abortion bans. Twelve states are enforcing bans on\u00a0abortion\u00a0at all stages of pregnancy and three others have bans like Georgia's that kick in after about six weeks.",
      "Like the others, Georgia's ban includes an exception if an abortion is necessary to maintain the woman's life. Those exceptions have been at the heart of legal and political questions, including a major Texas Supreme Court ruling last year that found the ban there applies even when there are major pregnancy complications.",
      "Smith's family, including her five-year-old son, still visit her in the hospital.",
      "Newkirk told WXIA that doctors told the family that the fetus has fluid on the brain and that they're concerned about his health.",
      "\"She's pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he's born,\" Newkirk said. She has not said whether the family wants Smith removed from life support.",
      "Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging Georgia's abortion law, said the situation is problematic.",
      "\"Her family deserved the right to have decision-making power about her medical decisions,\" Simpson said in a statement. \"Instead, they have endured over 90 days of retraumatization, expensive medical costs, and the cruelty of being unable to resolve and move toward healing.\"",
      "Lois Shepherd, a bioethicist and law professor at the University of Virginia, said she does not believe life support is legally required in this case.",
      "But she said whether a state could insist that Smith remains on life support is uncertain since the overturning of Roe, which found that fetuses do not have the rights of people.",
      "\"Pre-Dobbs, a fetus didn't have any rights,\" Shepherd said. \"And the state's interest in fetal life could not be so strong as to overcome other important rights, but now we don't know.\"",
      "The situation echoes a case in Texas more than a decade ago when a brain-dead woman was kept on life support for about two months because she was pregnant. A judge eventually ruled that the hospital was misapplying state law, and life support was removed.",
      "Brain death in pregnancy is rare. Even rarer still are cases in which doctors aim to prolong the pregnancy after a woman is declared brain-dead.",
      "\"It's a very complex situation, obviously, not only ethically but also medically,\" said Dr. Vincenzo Berghella, director of maternal fetal medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.",
      "A 2021 review that Berghella co-authored scoured medical literature going back decades for cases in which doctors declared a woman brain-dead and aimed to prolong her pregnancy. It found 35.",
      "Of those, 27 resulted in a live birth, the majority either immediately declared healthy or with normal follow-up tests. But Berghella also cautioned that the Georgia case was much more difficult because the pregnancy was less far along when the woman was declared brain dead. In the 35 cases he studied, doctors were able to prolong the pregnancy by an average of just seven weeks before complications forced them to intervene.",
      "\"It's just hard to keep the mother out of infection, out of cardiac failure,\" he said.",
      "Berghella also found a case from Germany that resulted in a live birth when the woman was declared brain dead at nine weeks of pregnancy - about as far along as Smith was when she died.",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin believes it's his destiny to recreate the Russian empire and won't back down in Ukraine, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Gates said Putin's aims can be unclear, even in one-on-one meetings.",
      "\"I'm not sure even in a face to face that you can judge Putin's intention,\" said Gates, who served as defense secretary under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \"My own view, having dealt with him and having spent most of my life working on Russia and the Soviet Union, is Putin feels that he has a destiny to recreate the Russian Empire. And as my old mentor, Zbigniew Brzezinski once said, without Ukraine, there can be no Russian Empire.\"",
      "While campaigning for a return to the White House, President Trump promised a swift end to the war that began three years ago when Russia invaded Ukraine. Now more than 100 days into Mr. Trump's second term, talks to end the conflict have been inconsistent, with little sign an end to fighting is in sight.",
      "\"I think the president is \u2014 based on what I read \u2014 is getting the sense that, as he put it, that Putin is 'tapping' him along and \u2026 Putin hasn't given up on any of his original goals in Ukraine,\" Gates said, referring to an April 26 social media post.",
      "In the post, Mr. Trump wrote of Putin, \"maybe he doesn't want to stop the war.\"",
      "Gates said Putin hasn't shown a willingness to make any major concessions.",
      "\"He's going to insist on occupying all four of the eastern provinces of the Donbas, perpetual recognition of Russian ownership of Crimea, a pro-Russian government in Kyiv and a Ukrainian military that looks a lot like an enhanced police force. And no membership in NATO and probably no membership in the EU,\" Gates said.",
      "President Trump said Friday he's moving to set up direct talks with Putin as soon as he can. Talks with lower-level Ukrainian and Russian delegations took place in Istanbul Friday, but there was little concrete progress beyond an agreement to a major prisoner exchange in the coming days.",
      "The conflict in Ukraine dates back to 2014, when Russian forces seized Crimea after protests in Ukraine led to the ousting of the country's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. Gates believes Putin wants the Ukraine that existed before that uprising.",
      "\"He wants Ukraine, basically, to be a client state of Russia, and I don't see what it would take to get him to walk away from any of those goals in the foreseeable future,\" Gates said. \"I mean, when you look at 900,000 or so Russian soldiers that have been killed or wounded, he's paid a huge price \u2013 the Russian economy and so on.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Friday said it will continue to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will continue to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas while they pursue a challenge to their removals under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The order from the high court grants an emergency injunction sought by lawyers for a group of Venezuelan migrants who they said faced \"imminent\" risk of removal under President Trump's March proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. It maintains an early directive issued by the Supreme Court last month that temporarily prohibited the government from removing the Venezuelan migrants held at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, under the 18th-century law. Some migrants removed under the law have been sent to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "The Supreme Court's April order, issued overnight, blocked the deportations \"until further order of this court.\"",
      "Shortly after the ruling Friday, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"THE SUPREME COURT WON'T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!\"",
      "Lee Gelernt, lead counsel in the ACLU's lawsuit against the administration over the deportations, said in a statement: \"The court's decision to stay removals is a powerful rebuke to the government's attempt to hurry people away to a Gulag-type prison in El Salvador.\"",
      "Friday's order was unsigned, and two justices dissented: Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.",
      "The order said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals was wrong to dismiss the detainees' appeal over lack of jurisdiction, vacating its judgement and remanding the case back to the court for further proceedings.",
      "The high court also said the plaintiffs in the case didn't receive enough notice to challenge their deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in court, pointing to the Trump administration's stated plan earlier in the case to deport them within about a day. But the justices did not specify exactly what kind of notice possible deportees should be granted, and said the Fifth Circuit should address that question.",
      "\"To be clear, we decide today only that the detainees are entitled to more notice than was given on April 18,\" the order read.",
      "The high court did not address whether the Trump administration has the legal right to deport Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act, and said lower courts should handle cases over the law \"expeditiously.\" It also noted that the government can use \"other lawful authorities\" other than the wartime law to remove the plaintiffs.",
      "\"We recognize the significance of the Government's national security interests as well as the necessity that such interests be pursued in a manner consistent with the Constitution. In light of the foregoing, lower courts should address AEA cases expeditiously,\" the court said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh concurred with the ruling, but argued the Supreme Court should have addressed the underlying questions immediately instead of sending it back down to lower courts. He pointed to conflicting rulings on whether the government can use the Alien Enemies Act and how much notice must be given to detainees \u2014 including a ruling in Pennsylvania earlier this week that became the first to rule Mr. Trump can use the 1798 law.",
      "\"The circumstances call for a prompt and final resolution, which likely can be provided only by this Court,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"At this juncture, I would prefer not to remand to the lower courts and further put off this Court's final resolution of the critical legal issues.\"",
      "In his dissent, Alito argued the high court didn't have jurisdiction to grant relief and should have allowed lower courts to handle the issue first. Thomas joined his dissent.",
      "The emergency appeal to the Supreme Court came in a fast-moving dispute that intensified after the American Civil Liberties Union said last month that it learned Venezuelan migrants being held at the facility in Anson had received notices informing them that they were subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU said that the notices classified the migrants as members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who must be removed from the U.S., and the men were informed they may be deported within hours.",
      "Lawyers for the Venezuelan migrants said that the Trump administration's actions violated the Supreme Court's early April decision in a different case involving removals under the Alien Enemies Act. In that ruling, the high court said migrants subject to removal under the 1798 law must receive notice that they faced deportation \"within a reasonable time\" and be allowed to bring habeas claims to challenge their removals.",
      "The Supreme Court's earlier decision also said judicial relief had to be sought in the district where the migrants are being held, which led the ACLU to file petitions in New York, southern Texas and Colorado on behalf of Venezuelan migrants who faced deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. The three judges overseeing those cases agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from using the wartime authority to deport migrants in custody within their districts.",
      "On May 1, the judge in southern Texas permanently blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants living or detained in the district, finding that the president's proclamation exceeded the scope of the law and was contrary to its terms.",
      "The ACLU had asked U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix of the Northern District of Texas to block the \"imminent\" removal of Venezuelan migrants detained at the Bluebonnet facility in Anson without adequate notice. The group alleged the Trump administration moved Venezuelan men from detention centers in Louisiana, Minnesota and California to Anson \"without meaningful explanation.\" The government also hadn't indicated the type of notice it planned to provide those covered by Mr. Trump's Alien Enemies Act proclamation or how much time it would give them before deporting them to El Salvador or another country, according to the ACLU.",
      "But Hendrix declined to issue temporary relief, finding two Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas who risked deportation under the Alien Enemies Act were not in impending danger of removal. A second federal judge in Washington, D.C., also refused to intervene in an 11th-hour bid by the ACLU to more broadly block the removals.",
      "After Hendrix declined the temporary restraining order, the ACLU said in court papers that the government gave detainees the notices, in English only, designating them for removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU also said officials told the men they would be removed within 24 hours.",
      "The group then sought relief simultaneously from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and the Supreme Court.",
      "The ACLU argued that the government's actions do not give Venezuelan migrants in northern Texas who are at risk of removal under the Alien Enemies Act a \"realistic opportunity\" to pursue judicial relief and warned that without intervention, dozens or hundreds of Venezuelan men were at risk at being removed to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where they would have no chance to contest their designation as an \"alien enemy\" or their removal.",
      "\"The public has a critical interest in preventing wrongful removals, especially where it could mean a lifetime sentence in a notorious foreign prison,\" they wrote.",
      "But the Trump administration said the ACLU's request for an injunction is \"unprecedented,\" and argued it is too early for the Supreme Court to intervene. Solicitor General John Sauer told the court in a filing that the government had agreed not to use the Alien Enemies Act to remove detainees who have filed habeas petitions.",
      "Trump invokes Alien Enemies Act",
      "Signed last month, the president's proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act has already sparked significant clashes with the federal courts. The 1798 law has been used only three times before, and each time during a period of war.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation provides that all Venezuelan nationals ages 14 and older who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents are subject to swift apprehension and removal as alien enemies. The president claimed that migrants with alleged ties to the gang were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S.",
      "Shortly after the proclamation was signed in mid-March, the administration used the Alien Enemies Act to remove more than 100 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they have been detained at its Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to deport the Venezuelan migrants using the authority set off a legal battle in Washington, D.C. The judge overseeing that case, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt over what he said was its defiance of an order involving the removals of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
      "The case that gave rise to that extraordinary order landed before the Supreme Court in late March. The high court divided 5-4 in finding that Mr. Trump could carry out deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, but unanimously agreed that judicial review must be available to people subject to removal under the law.",

    "story": [
      "An undocumented immigrant who resides in Florida is facing a more than $1.82 million fine for failing to leave the country after receiving a removal order 20 years ago, CBS News has learned.",
      "According to the notice sent May 9 by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's civil fines department and provided to CBS News, the 41-year-old Florida woman and mother of three, who CBS News has chosen not to name, was charged $500 for every day she has remained in the U.S. since the removal order was issued in April 2005, running up a total of $1,821,350.",
      "CBS News has reached out to ICE for comment.",
      "This case represents an enforcement of the civil fines listed under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which also requires undocumented immigrants to register with the U.S. government, according to Michelle Sanchez, the Florida-based immigration attorney representing the Honduran immigrant.",
      "In February, the Trump administration announced its plans to penalize those living in the U.S. illegally under that immigration act. It encompasses a range of regulations but has historically rarely been enforced since its implementation.",
      "According to Sanchez, the removal order was issued after the woman failed to show up to a court hearing in 2005.",
      "In 2024, Sanchez filed a motion to reopen her client's case and have the removal order lifted, arguing the Honduran woman was eligible to apply for U.S. residency because she had resided in the U.S. for more than 10 years with no criminal record.",
      "Sanchez said her client is also a mother of three U.S. citizen children who would be qualifying relatives as they would suffer extreme and exceptionally unusual hardships if she were deported.",
      "Under the Biden administration, ICE attorneys were given discretion to reopen cases to lift removal orders. Hundreds of thousands of these requests were left pending, however, according to Sanchez. In March, ICE notified the Florida immigration lawyer they could not reopen her client's case because the Trump administration did not offer guidance on such prosecutorial discretion.",
      "Sanchez told CBS News she has seen an uptick in ICE issuing fines to her clients who remain in the country illegally, but the million dollar civil fine marks a first.",
      "\"ICE is terrorizing individuals without even having to go pick them up,\" Sanchez said. \"They are terrorizing them by sending these notices where they are fining individuals an exorbitant amount of money that a person sometimes doesn't even make that amount in their lifetime.\"",
      "The notice sent to the Florida mother of three indicates that the fine can be contested, and that requesting a personal interview to do so is an option.",
      "\"They're going into the lion's den,\" Sanchez said, adding that anyone who receives such a notice should first reach out to their immigration lawyer before showing up in person to contest fines.",
      "Sanchez indicates she will be appealing her client's fine as the Honduran mother was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart the U.S. once the removal order was issued.",
      "\"I welcome the orderly application of immigration law and I welcome CBP protecting us,\" Sanchez said, \"but the laws have to be respected and if rights are trampled, there has to be consequences.\"",

    "summary": "CBS News reported in March that the defense secretary ordered a pause in cyber operations against Russia. Rep. Don Bacon disclosed its duration during a hearing.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said the U.S. government halted cyber operations against Russia for one day in February as President Trump was trying to negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, confirming CBS News reporting at the time and undercutting statements of denial from the Defense Department.",
      "\"I actually dug into this whole matter. I just want to address it: It was a one-day pause, which is typical for negotiations,\" said Bacon, chair of the House Armed Services cyber subcommittee, during a\u00a0hearing on Capitol Hill on Friday. \"That's just about as much as I can say. It was a one-day pause.\"",
      "In March, multiple U.S. officials\u00a0told CBS News that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had issued a directive to U.S. Cyber Command to pause cyber operations against Russia, including those that were the most provocative. At the time, the duration of the pause was unknown.",
      "In response to reports about the pause, the Pentagon's rapid response team\u00a0posted on March 4 on X that Hegseth \"has neither canceled nor delayed any cyber operations directed against malicious Russian targets and there has been no stand-down order whatsoever from that priority.\"",
      "Two sources familiar with Hegseth's order said the pause directive lacked specificity. It's not clear how the order about planning was interpreted. Multiple officials also told CBS News in March that strategizing for future operations was never paused and that U.S. cyber policy on Russia \"is very much intact\" and remains at the same level, one of the officials said.",
      "Bacon's remarks are the first on-the-record acknowledgment of the directive's existence, which was first reported in February by\u00a0The Record, a cybersecurity news publication.",
      "It's not uncommon for certain military operations to be paused during sensitive negotiations between countries. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have halted operations to prevent U.S. intentions from being misconstrued and to keep diplomacy on track.",
      "In addition to the Pentagon's statement on X, the Trump administration stonewalled inquiries on the matter and continued to deny any pause was ordered.",
      "A senior U.S. defense official at the Defense Department declined to answer questions from CBS News at the time when asked about the reported pause.",
      "In Friday's House hearing, the statement from DOD Rapid Response was called out by Army veteran and Democratic Rep. Eugene Vindman, who accused the Pentagon of lying about the pause directive.",
      "\"What I would like to do is basically point out that that statement by DOD Rapid Response was an outright lie,\" said the Virginia congressman. \"It was at least misleading. And that is not what the American people deserve, and that will be something that I intend to follow up with the secretary when he actually shows up.\"",
      "The Pentagon\u00a0created the DOD Rapid Response account in February, and it is\u00a0overseen by conservative podcaster and Army veteran Graham Allen, who is now the Pentagon's digital media director.",
      "The account commonly attacks news publications and posts comments criticizing reporting about Hegseth and the Defense Department. The X account has omitted context from its statements, touting an\u00a0increase in U.S. military recruiting numbers between February 2024 through February 2025, even though much of the period showing improved recruitment numbers occurred during the Biden administration, as CBS News' Confirmed team found.",
      "Trump administration officials have promised to run \"the most transparent Defense Department in history,\" but to date, the Pentagon has\u00a0held just one formal briefing. Instead of regular press engagements, the Pentagon's modus operandi for official Defense Department communications is often to bypass legacy news media outlets and attack their reporting. Questions to the Pentagon were referred to U.S. Cyber Command, which told CBS News Friday that \"due to operational security concerns, we do not comment nor discuss cyber intelligence, plans, or operations.\"",

      "A military parade to mark the Army's anniversary next month \u2014 coinciding with President Trump's birthday \u2014 is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, an Army spokesperson told CBS News. The price estimate encompasses the whole festival, including the events leading up to the parade.",
      "The parade in Washington, D.C., is expected to include over 100 vehicles and thousands of soldiers who will be housed in federal buildings. It could also involve 50 helicopters, prompting \"extensive coordination\" with the Federal Aviation Administration, the spokesperson said.",
      "The event will also feature Abrams tanks, and the military plans to lay down metal plates on the streets of Washington to avoid damaging the pavement with the 120,000-pound armored vehicles, a defense official said.",
      "The event will take place as part of the Army's 250th anniversary celebrations on June 14 \u2014 the same day as Mr. Trump's 79th birthday.",

      "Reports about a possible military parade began circulating last month. Initial plans obtained by The Associated Press two weeks ago called for more than 6,600 soldiers, seven bands and 150 vehicles, including tanks as well as Stryker and Bradley fighting vehicles \u2014 though at the time, the Army said the plans had not been finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed the plans earlier this month: \"We're going to have a big, beautiful parade,\" the president told NBC's \"Meet The Press.\"",
      "The president also said the event isn't tied to his birthday. When asked about the price tag, Mr. Trump said it would be \"peanuts compared to the value of doing it.\"",
      "\"We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we're going to celebrate it,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News.",
      "The plans have drawn some criticism from Democrats. Earlier this month, Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee called the plan wasteful, writing in a statement, \"The egotist-in-chief wants taxpayers to foot the bill for a military parade on his birthday.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in the pageantry of a military parade dates back years. During a 2017 visit to France during his first term, the president praised the country's annual Bastille Day parade and suggested \"we're going to have to try and top it\" on the Fourth of July.",
      "A year later, the administration began drawing up plans for a parade to recognize Veterans Day. But after reports circulated that the event could cost as much as $92 million \u2014 and some Democratic lawmakers blasted the idea as \"self-aggrandizing\" \u2014 Mr. Trump postponed the event and blamed local elected officials for driving up the price.",
      "\"The local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it,\" Mr. Trump posted on X, then known as Twitter, in 2018.",

      "A federal judge grew frustrated with the Trump administration Friday as it pushed to withhold details on what it has done to reverse the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to a prison in El Salvador as the result of an \"administrative error.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. last month \u2014 and has sparred with the administration since then, ordering government lawyers to produce details on their efforts and accusing them of failing to adequately comply.",
      "Attorney Andrew Rossman said he and the rest of the legal team seeking to return Abrego Garcia have hit a \"roadblock\" in discovery efforts, as the Justice Department has invoked the state secrets privilege and other privileges to withhold information in the case. Rossman cited a \"paltry\" number of documents provided during court-ordered fact-finding.",
      "\"We have no case without knowing what steps they've taken or what steps they have not taken,\" to return Abrego Garcia, Rossman said Friday. He pointed to a \"dichotomy\" between Justice Department filings saying they are complying with a court order to return him and public statements from President Trump and other top administration officials saying they will not return the man.",
      "Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn argued the government has properly invoked the state secrets privilege in this case and has cooperated with all discovery efforts by Abrego Garcia's attorneys. He said Abrego Garcia's lawyers are \"seeking a categorical piercing\" of the state secrets privilege to get the answers they want.",
      "Xinis rejected the argument, saying, \"you can't tell me that these depositions are a good faith effort\" to answer questions about what operations were or are underway to return Abrego Garcia. \"This is about good faith versus bad faith,\" she added.",
      "\"I'm like the cat with the ball of string, and I'm just trying to keep up with the string.\" Xinis said about her attempts to keep up with the Justice Department's various privilege arguments in the case.",
      "Xinis allowed an expedited discovery process to begin last month after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order to facilitate his return to the U.S. The Supreme Court had agreed that the administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "Xinis said Friday that the depositions undertaken so far of Trump administration officials resulted in a \"goose egg\" and had no new knowledge in them, citing numerous \"I don't knows\" provided in answers to questions from Abrego Garcia's attorneys.",
      "Rossman said that he and the rest of the legal team representing Abrego Garcia have only received 32 new documents in their discovery efforts, and 1,140 documents submitted in discovery are being withheld from them under \"any manner of privilege\" the Justice Department could invoke.",
      "Rossman added that the Justice Department has promised additional documents from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but that he and his co-counsel have not received them yet.",
      "\"It's critical, a life is in the balance. Due process is in the balance,\" Rossman said about the need for a quick resolution to discovery.",
      "Guuyn said that the Justice Department got another update from El Salvador yesterday that Abrego Garcia is in \"good health\" and has \"gained weight\" since his detention there.",
      "After the two and a half hours of the hearing in open court ended, Xinis held a closed-door argument on the remaining disagreements between the sides on sealed discovery documents.",
      "Trump administration spars with judge over deportation",
      "Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador, entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and lived in Maryland after that. In 2019, he was granted a withholding of removal, a legal status that prevented the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador because of a risk of persecution by local gangs.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was among the hundreds of migrants sent by the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center prison, or CECOT, in March.",
      "A federal immigration official acknowledged in court papers his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the administration has since declined to return him to the U.S. Instead, top administration officials have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant. His lawyers argue that Abrego Garcia is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang, and has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",
      "Guynn and Xinis got into a heated back-and-forth over the legality of Abrego Garcia's removal on Friday, after Guynn said that Abrego Garcia was \"removed lawfully\" from the U.S. to El Salvador.",
      "\"That's not lawful,\" Xinis said, citing a previous court order that barred Abrego Garcia's removal specifically to El Salvador.",
      "\"He'll never walk free in the United States.\" Guynn said, saying he will be in U.S. custody if he was ever returned to the United States as removal proceedings play out.",
      "\"That sounds to me like an admission of your client that your client will not take steps\" to return Abrego Garcia, Xinis said. \"That's about as clear as it gets.\"",
      "Xinis later chastised Guynn for suggesting that Abrego Garcia's arrest was lawful, which even Erez Reuveni, a Justice Department attorney who first argued the case, admitted in court proceedings that it was not, and that the arrest was warrantless.",
      "\"It was highly publicized that Mr. Reuveni was benched,\" for honestly answering her questions, Xinis said.",
      "Mr. Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said it is up to El Salvador whether to release Abrego Garcia. As of April 21, he was being held at a lower-security facility in Santa Ana, according to a declaration from a State Department official.",
      "In a separate case in Washington, D.C., the Justice Department has argued in court that due to a financial agreement with the Salvadoran government, it does not have constructive custody over the detainees who were moved from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act once they are in CECOT or other Salvadoran prisons, and cannot be compelled to return Abrego Garcia or any other person detained in El Salvador under the agreement.",
      "Government claims \"state secrets\"",
      "The administration's assertion of privilege was revealed in an order last week from Xinis, which asked lawyers for Abrego Garcia and the Justice Department to file additional legal papers about the administration's \"invocations of privilege, principally the state secrets and deliberative process privileges.\"",
      "Attorneys for Abrego Garcia asked for Xinis to grant additional depositions in their discovery efforts, including potentially a deposition with someone with first-hand knowledge of efforts to return Abrego Garcia from the White House. The Justice Department called the request \"unreasonable\" and added that more depositions \"goes well beyond the limited discovery the Court granted.\"",
      "The Justice Department had indicated last month that it would invoke certain privileges to protect information regarding Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S., citing in a filing the attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and certain executive privileges.",
      "Administration lawyers had said that a request for documents from Abrego Garcia's legal team about the terms of any arrangement regarding the government's use of El Salvador's notorious prison to house deportees from the U.S. \"calls for the immediate production of classified documents, as well as documents that defendants may elect to assert are subject to the protections of attorney-client privilege and the state secrets privilege.\"",

    "summary": "Multiple staff members at the Kennedy Center said they are sounding the alarm that the mission and legacy of the storied arts institution are at risk.",
    "story": [
      "Staff employees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts\u00a0in Washington, D.C. announced this week an intent to unionize across departments and argue for collective bargaining rights. The effort comes amid months of layoffs and job uncertainty following major changes brought on by the Trump administration.",
      "According to multiple staff members who spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity, more than 150 employees that handle crucial responsibilities for the Kennedy Center \u2014 including education, donor relations, and arts programming \u2014 are sounding the alarm that the mission and legacy of the storied arts institution are at risk unless a sense of normalcy is returned to everyday operations.",
      "\"We are the ones that put the artists in the classrooms and on the stages,\" one Kennedy Center education staff member told CBS News.",
      "After multiple departments have been shuttered completely, the staff member said she is hoping unionization will restore a sense of security for those remaining, as well as improve transparency and communication from leadership, which she says has been lacking.",
      "\"We're trying to carry out the work the best we can. But anxiety and fear exist with so many departments experiencing layoffs,\" she said. \"And they happen quickly, with very little notice.\"",
      "Back in February, President Trump installed himself as the chairman of the Board of Trustees of the storied arts institution while firing then-Chairman David M. Rubenstein and 18 members of the bipartisan board, replacing the vacancies with White House appointees.",
      "Following the vote, Mr. Trump dismissed much of the Kennedy Center's executive leadership, including President Deborah Rutter, who served in the role for more than a decade.",
      "When asked in a March interview with Norah O'Donnell what the hardest part of these changes is, Rutter replied, \"I think the sting is the disregard for expertise and experience. We were working toward something extraordinary.\"",
      "The Trump administration has said an overhaul is needed because the\u00a0marquee arts center is \"woke ... and broke.\"\u00a0The White House did not immediately respond to a request by CBS News for comment on Friday.",
      "But staff members on the ground have heard little from the top on what these changes may include. Staff members told CBS News that no typical quarterly all-staff meeting has been held, and weekly departmental updates have ceased. Ticket sales are reportedly down 50% this quarter, but employees have stopped receiving regular ticket sales reports. Workers believe they are flying blind.",
      "After the initial wave of firings in February, broader layoffs have continued in recent weeks. The entire social impact team was let go in late March, and just this week, an international arm of the programming department was laid off, jeopardizing efforts to get talented artists from outside the United States booked for this season.",
      "\"These teams are small, and they're close. We're all friends. So, it's hard to see your friends lose their jobs, and they're the ones telling us,\" one programming staff member admitted. \"But more than that, there's uncertainty [over] what jobs still need to be done and what is being shelved.\"",
      "There's been intensified concern about the fundraising efforts for the non-profit organization, which brought in an estimated $141 million in grants and donations in fiscal year 2023. The development department, which operated with about 90 employees for years previously, has been reduced to about 30 presently on staff, leaving major holes in budgeting and donor cultivation duties.",
      "The petition filed with the National Labor Relations Board on Thursday indicates that 172 regular full-time and part-time employees plan to vote to unionize with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, commonly known as UAW. The workers range across departments handling development, education, marketing, programming, the National Symphony Orchestra and the Washington National Opera.",
      "\"Unionizing is a call for transparency and to protect jobs,\" said another staff member. \"We are a ground-up, employee-led movement of Kennedy Center employees. And when we win this vote, we will have secured the future of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for another 53 years, in its original non-partisan, non-political way.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was founded in 1971 as a national cultural center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Its annual honors ceremony, which airs on CBS, features the best in music, theater and dance.",
      "Staff believe they have well over the simple majority of 50% to unionize, and generally have overwhelming support from everyone in the building for their effort. The vote is expected to take place in the coming weeks.",

      "The House Republican bill to enact President Trump's domestic policy agenda contains a provision that has prompted opposition from the Mexican government \u2014 a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries.",
      "The payments, known as remittances, would be subject to a 5% excise tax that would encompass more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "In a May 13 letter to the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, Esteban Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., urged Chairman Jason Smith and Ranking Member Richard Neal to reconsider the proposal.",

      "Spokespeople for both Smith and Neal did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In April, President Trump hinted at a crackdown on remittances, announcing in a Truth Social Post\u00a0that the administration was \"finalizing a presidential memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside of the United States.\" But details on the presidential proposal were unclear.",
      "The remittance tax provisions in the bill have become an international flashpoint. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has also criticized the plan and urged Republican lawmakers to reconsider it.",
      "At a press briefing this week, Sheinbaum warned that the proposal \"would damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\"",
      "\"Remittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States', which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\" she said.",
      "An estimate by the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, which is cited in the letter, found that Mexican migrant workers sent on average 16.7% of their labor income as remittances.",
      "\"In other words, more than 80% of the income generated by this community remains in the U.S. economy,\" the letter says.",
      "The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, however, that the proposal would generate a little more than $1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2026, and rise to about $3 billion by 2034.",
      "In the letter to lawmakers, Barrag\u00e1n said the proposal would amount to double taxation, \"since migrants already pay taxes in the country where they work.\"",
      "\"Imposing a tax on these transfers would disproportionately affect those with the least, without accounting for their ability to pay,\" he added and also warned of other unintended consequences.",
      "\"Many migrants might seek informal or unregulated means to do so, complicating oversight and control of these financial flows. This would not only reduce the expected revenue but also increase risks related to financial security, tax evasion and money laundering,\" he wrote.",
      "Barrag\u00e1n has been meeting with lawmakers in recent days and discussing the matter with them. On Tuesday, he hosted a dinner for members of Congress, including Texas Rep. Tony Gonzalez, whose district spans the length of much of the state's border with Mexico and is home to many migrant workers. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and Florida Rep Maria Elvira Salazar attended the dinner.",
      "Salazar said, when asked about the proposal, she was still assessing the legislation and who exactly it will affect, noting that banks already charge fees for such transactions.",
      "\"I just want what's fair, what's just and what's Christian,\" she said.",
      "Separately, Barragan met with Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick and also discussed the remittance measure.",
      "Representatives for the electronic payment transfer industry also expressed concern that this proposal would harm vulnerable communities.",
      "\"Such a measure would harm the most financially vulnerable consumers, undermine small businesses, disrupt critical financial regulations, and weaken law enforcement's ability to combat illicit activity,\" the Electronic Transactions Association wrote to Smith and Neal.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump Jr. has maneuvered potentially lucrative business deals while also becoming a power player to his father.",
    "story": [
      "When the crypto mining firm American Bitcoin announced plans to go public on the Nasdaq stock exchange this week, the company called it a \"major milestone\" for a key stakeholder, Dominari Holdings \u2014 a little-known investment house that recently added a very recognizable name to its advisory board: Donald Trump Jr.",
      "It was the latest maneuver in a series of high-stakes, and potentially lucrative business deals Trump Jr. and his younger brother Eric, also a Dominari adviser, stand to benefit from.",
      "Since his father won the 2024 election, Trump Jr. has joined at least eight corporate boards or advisory committees, adding political clout and his famous family brand to companies that sell handguns, make drones, and offer healthcare services online.",
      "During President Trump's second term, his son Donald Jr. has morphed from a lower profile presence in Washington to what Trump first term press secretary Sean Spicer, who knows Trump Jr. well, describes as the \"most prominent non-elected representative of the MAGA base hands down, the No. 1 surrogate and power player in the ecosystem outside of his father.\" The most overt symbol of that ascendence \u2013 and of the Trump family's unique blend of governing and deal-making, went public last month, with the announcement of a highly exclusive private club, which is named\u00a0 \"Executive Branch.\"",
      "At the coming-out event, the cocktails flowed and servers passed caviar to A-list guests that included Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Attorney General Pam Bondi; Paul Atkins, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and FCC chair Brendan Carr. The Capital's buzzy newsletters revealed the club's eye-popping club membership fee: $500,000.",
      "Private clubs have long been a fixture of official Washington, where lobbyists and well-heeled donors can mingle with members of Congress and high-ranking officials.\u00a0 But this venture launched by the president's oldest son is something new \u2014 and, according to critics, serves as the latest example of how the Trump family has turbo-charged Washington's pay-to-play culture.",
      "\"I don't think there has ever been anything comparable to this use of the presidency to advance private business interests,\" said Richard Briffault, a law professor who specializes in government ethics at Columbia Law School.",
      "Critics fear a pay-to-play culture",
      "To government watchdogs, the members-only social club embodies what they say is an increasingly brazen mingling of private business interests and government policy.",
      "\"It's unseemly and it undermines the public's faith that the government is operating in the public interest,\" said Brett Kappel, a veteran Washington, D.C., election lawyer.",
      "Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who has for years advocated for stronger ethics rules in the nation's capital, told CBS News she views the club as a blatant play to cash in with interest groups seeking access to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This is literally members bringing money into the pockets of Donald Trump Jr, and his business partners,\" Sloan said.",
      "Trump Jr.'s allies disagree. They argue the extravagant membership fee actually cuts against the claim that it is a vehicle for influence peddling \u2014 because members are already so well connected.",
      "\"If your goal was to let as many people in as possible, you'd have every lobbyist in D.C. join,\" said one source familiar with the concept behind the club, pointing out that members who could afford the sky-high admission fee would likely already be well known in Washington's power corridors.",
      "For his part, Trump Jr. disputes suggestions that he is cashing in on his father's name or testing any ethical boundaries.",
      "\"I'm a private citizen who has been a businessman my entire life,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"It's laughable that the left-wing media thinks that I should lock myself in a padded room and cease what I've been doing for over 25 years to earn a living and provide for my five children,\" Trump Jr. added.",
      "The White House calls Trump Jr.'s private sector dealings ethically sound, pointing out that President Trump's assets are held in a trust controlled by his family",
      "The \"Executive Branch\" club is only one of the ways Trump Jr. has raised his profile during his father's second term. The president's son has rapidly expanded the family's crypto profile and continued to pursue real estate investments.\u00a0 He has also been a front-facing leader of the MAGA empire, supplanting his sister Ivanka and brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, as the most high-profile \u2014 and politically astute \u2014 Trump scion in Washington.",
      "The \"Trump bump\"",
      "The family business is a global enterprise. Recently, Trump Jr. made a whirlwind tour of several foreign nations, including Serbia, Hungary and Bulgaria, where he looked in on real estate interests, delivered lucrative speeches and met with government leaders, according to The New York Times.",
      "At home, Trump Jr.'s move to join a spree of corporate boards in the role of adviser or board member traces in part to his relationship with Omeed Malik, the financier and mega Trump donor who is also Trump Jr.'s co-founder in the D.C. social club.",
      "Just days after the election, Malik brought on Trump Jr. as a partner in his venture capital firm, 1789 Capital, which says on its website that it invests in conservative companies and eschews \"woke capitalism\" and other left-wing causes, a deal a knowledgeable source said was in the works before the election. \u00a0 Trump Jr. soon joined the boards of arms retailer GrabAGun as well as the online health care company BlinkRX, both 1789 Capital properties.",
      "It is not hard to see the impact when a company adds Trump Jr. to its board. When Dominari Holdings inc., a wealth management and banking services company, announced that it was bringing on both of the president's sons, its stock price shot up 83% to a record high, eventually settling down to 30% above where it was before Trump Jr. joined. Shortly thereafter, Dominari's CEO announced that the company was planning investments in AI and data centers, growth industries where the Trump administration has been massively rolling back regulations. In a company press release, CEO Kyle Wood he cited Trump Jr.'s and Eric Trump's \"strategic insight\" in both of those sectors.",
      "And this week, the Bitcoin mining company owned partly by Trump sons Donald Jr. and Eric engineered a listing on the NASDAQ after merging with a smaller, publicly traded mining firm called Gryphon Digital Mining Inc. Dominari Holdings is effectively acting as the banker for the deal and has been reaching out to potential investors.",
      "In another example of the so-called \"Trump bump,\" the stock price of Unusual Machines, a Florida-based drone manufacturer, nearly doubled when the news hit that Trump Jr. was joining the board.",
      "Unusual Machines, which manufactures its unmanned aerial vehicles and components in the U.S., is aiming to reduce American dependence on Chinese drones. But for the time being the company is reliant on Chinese parts, which means that the Trump administration's yo-yoing tariffs on China could hurt the company's bottom line. CEO Allan Evans has said he would not ask Trump Jr. to intervene with the federal government on the company's behalf for relief.",
      "\"I would never ask him to do anything or facilitate anything like that,\" Evans told the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Trump Jr. and his defenders clap back at critics who suggest his moves to join board seats and champion business interests carry the echoes of past ventures by presidential relatives like Billy Carter, Neil Bush or Hunter Biden. They call him a skilled entrepreneur with a long record of business success who has capitalized on his position by making shrewd business decisions, cultivating lucrative connections among tech and finance leaders, all while building up a powerful political operation in Washington.",
      "The Hunter Biden comparisons, in particular, have drawn a sharp response: \"He became a 'businessman' after his dad got elected,\" Trump Jr. said in a social media post. \"I joined a Venture Capital Firm that invests in private American companies \u2014 Nothing to do with the government.\"",
      "MAGA power broker",
      "\"Don Jr. was an accomplished businessman long before his father got into politics and just continues to grow,\" said Sean Spicer, who served the president as press secretary in his first term and now hosts the Sean Spicer podcast.",
      "Today, Spicer says Trump Jr. is the man to see. Spicer, who worked closely with the president's son during the first term, says has seen the evolution up close.",
      "\"If the phone rings and it's Don Jr., you better pick it up on the first ring,\" Spicer said. During the 2020 campaign Trump Jr. emerged as a potent asset for his father, stumping on the trail and fully embodying the MAGA brand.\u00a0 He flung \"red meat\" to the rapturous crowds at Trump rallies and showed an instinct for the jugular that reminded observers of Trump senior.",
      "A big part of his success, his friends say, is an ability to blend with the grassroots MAGA world.",
      "\"Don Jr. isn't just a billionaire's son, he's one of us,\" said Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point USA, the preeminent MAGA aligned youth organization and an associate of Trump Jr.",
      "Trump Jr.'s inside and outside game makes him a unique player in Trump's Washington, his allies say \u2014 someone with unparalleled clout within the administration who is also able to operate freely in the private sector.",
      "He has forged close ties with powerful tech titans like Elon Musk and David O. Sacks, the angel investor who was a key figure in bringing a powerful and wealthy contingent of Silicon Valley over to Trump.

    "story": [
      "Bruce Springsteen gave his latest stinging criticism of President Trump and his administration, calling them \"treasonous\" and \"incompetent\" to kick off the first show of his British tour this week. The president responded in a Truth Social post that included criticism of the rocker's skin and telling him to \"keep his mouth shut\" until returning to the U.S.",
      "Springsteen, a long and prominent supporter of Democratic presidential candidates, made his remarks at a concert in Manchester, England, on Wednesday during the first of his \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" tour.",
      "\"The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock 'n' roll in dangerous times,\" he said. \"In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\"",
      "The 75-year-old rocker, who later shared a transcript and video of his remarks on his website and YouTube channel, asked supporters of democracy to \"raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!\"",
      "Throughout the concert, Springsteen accused Mr. Trump and his administration of authoritarianism, rolling back civil rights, blocking free speech and \"taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers.\"",
      "\"They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,\" Springsteen said. \"They're abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump responded on his social media platform, saying that the rocker is \"just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\"",
      "He added: \"Springsteen is 'dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out 'prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just 'standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!\"",
      "This is not the first time Springsteen has aimed at Mr. Trump and his policies.",
      "When he endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election, Springsteen called Mr. Trump \"the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.\"",
      "\"Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does than at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,\" the rock star said in\u00a0a short video\u00a0shared on social media.",
      "In a\u00a02016 interview\u00a0with Rolling Stone, Springsteen called Mr. Trump a \"moron.\" When Mr. Trump was running for reelection in 2020, Springsteen\u00a0told\u00a0The Atlantic he didn't know \"if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.\"",

      "The original statue met with mixed opinions by locals, with one resident telling Reuters in 2019 that the Melania depicted in the sculpture \"does not look as beautiful as she normally is,\" while another local told BBC News it looked like \"Smurfette.\" It had been carved out of a tree trunk by local chainsaw artist Ales Zupevc, BBC News reported.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 16:34:13 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether he supported the president's plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he thought \"it'll be the subject of probably multiple lawsuits, and I think the courts will probably have something to say about it.\"",

      "How do I file a claim?",

      "You can find the email by searching for the subject line, \"Lopez Voice Assistant Class Action Settlement.\" Some consumers received the emails as recently as Monday, May 12.",
      "But if you didn't get an email or postcard but believe you qualify for the settlement, you can still file by clicking on \"new claim\" on the same link. You'll be prompted to enter info such as your name, address and proof of purchase of the Apple device that qualifies you for the settlement.",
      "When could I get the settlement payment?",
      "Not until later this year at the earliest.",

      "When you submit your claim, you'll be asked if you want the payment to be sent via physical check, e-check or direct deposit.",

He hawked what he called \"white nationalism 3.0\" \u2014 a more local, decentralized approach to the white nationalist movement.",
      "Rundo was arrested in Romania in 2023 after the U.S. requested his extradition on federal rioting charges. He was sentenced to two years and effectively received a time-served sentence, being released in December 2024.",
      "The shift to \"white nationalism 3.0\" is similar to leaderless resistance concepts across the far right ecosystem, said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.",
      "\"I think a lot of these groups really function more like brands,\" he said.",
      "Audio messages and a leaked internal memo obtained by the SPLC confirmed direct affiliations between Patriot Front and certain Active Clubs. The founder of a Texas active club was berated for recruiting \"non-European\" members.",
      "\"Is our organization something you are totally committed to, or are you going to be the active club guy doing your own thing?\" The Patriot Front member asked, according to the SPLC report.",
      "The new recruitment method has coincided with Patriot Front's faltering brand, the SPLC says, after years of controversies stemming from various lawsuits and acts of vandalism. In January, Patriot Front was\u00a0ordered to pay\u00a0$2.7 million in damages to a Black musician the group attacked during a march in Boston in 2022. In February, a\u00a0settlement\u00a0was reached between Patriot Front and two North Dakota nonprofits over allegations that the group intimidated immigrant business owners.",
      "Patriot Front has also faced scrutiny from within the right-wing movement. \"In some sections of this larger far right, Patriot Front is branded as federal agents,\" Tischauser said. \"So to avoid that accusation, they use Active Clubs and start trying to groom people into Patriot Front membership from there.\"",
      "The conspiracy theory even gained enough traction on social media to reach Elon Musk. Last year, he posted on\u00a0X, \"This does seem odd. Why no mask removal after arrest?\" in reaction to a post of Patriot Front members being detained, where an X user dubbed the group \"Fed Front.\"",
      "The conspiracy that FBI agents pose as right-wing activists goes beyond Patriot Front. A Washington Post-University of Maryland\u00a0poll\u00a0found that a quarter of Americans believe the FBI instigated the\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The FBI said in a statement to CBS News Saturday, \"The FBI investigates individuals who commit or intend to commit violence and other criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security. Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on criminal activity.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Patriot Front's founder and leader, Thomas Rosseau, via email.",
      "Lewis said that there has been a mainstreaming of conspiracy theories and hateful beliefs once confined to neo-Nazi forums and considered to be fringe.",
      "\"Today, you have the richest man in the world,\u00a0members of Congress\u00a0tweeting this out, as if it's like a real thing that's happening,\" Lewis said. \"That just broadens out the aperture of disaffected young, predominantly white men who are looking for someone to blame, something to blame.\"",
      "Since these clubs are scattered, unaffiliated entities, Patriot Front has faced challenges in its recruitment efforts.",
      "\"They want to project themselves as much larger and much more serious than they actually are,\" said Lewis.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial continues next week in New York City. His ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura\u00a0wrapped up her testimony Friday after four days on the stand.",
      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "On Friday, they also heard from a special agent who photographed the hotel where Combs was arrested last year, and from Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard, who testified about seeing Combs assault Ventura.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband and brother were both seen in court for support.",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",

    "summary": "Former President Joe Biden's speech is marked with long pauses and a halting delivery in a recording of his interview about classified documents released Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Snippets from a 2023 interview that led Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur to describe former President Joe Biden as an \"elderly man with a poor memory\" were obtained and published by Axios Friday, showing Biden's halting tone of voice and difficulty remembering dates.",
      "CBS News has confirmed the audio matches the transcript of the interview released by the Biden White House in 2024.",
      "In one four-minute clip, Biden was asked by Hur's team \u2014 which was investigating Biden's handling of classified records \u2014 about where he kept his documents shortly after leaving office as vice president. Biden's response is marked by long pauses, and his voice appears hoarse at times. His speech is especially halting as he describes the period around his son Beau's death.",
      "In the audio obtained by news outlet Axios, Biden can also be heard struggling to remember the year when Beau died or the year when President Trump was first elected. Members of his staff can be heard correcting him or reminding him of the date.",
      "A written transcript of the five-hour interview was released last year, but portions of the audio released Friday provide context on Biden's demeanor and memory problems at certain points in the session.",
      "In response to the audio, Biden spokesperson Kelly Scully told CBS News in a statement, \"The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago. The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.\"",
      "Biden's verbal delivery was a key part of Hur's report. The special counsel wrote in February 2024 that Biden sounded like a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Hur said it's a view jurors may share, making it hard to convict Biden of knowingly holding sensitive documents at his home and office. Hur's report noted \"significant limitations\" to Biden's memory, including his difficulty remembering when his son died.",
      "Hur recommended against charging Biden with a crime, though he did conclude that Biden \"willfully\" retained government documents.",
      "At the time, Biden and his allies reacted furiously to Hur's report \u2014 especially the \"elderly man with a poor memory\" line and the comment about Beau Biden's death.",
      "\"There's even a reference that I don't remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn't any of their damn business,\" Biden said last year. \"I don't need anyone to tell me when he passed away.\"",
      "Biden's personal attorney Bob Bauer called the report a \"shabby piece of work\" filled with \"totally inappropriate and pejorative comments.\" The Biden White House counsel's office asked Hur's team to revise the report, calling its references to Biden's memory \"inflammatory.\"",
      "The report was released as concerns swirled about Biden's age and fitness to run for another term, though at the time, Democratic officials publicly backed Biden and slammed Hur. Republicans, meanwhile, cited the report as evidence of Biden's fading cognitive abilities and pushed for audio of the interview to be released. Biden was 80 years old at the time of Hur's interview.",
      "But months later, Biden's rocky June debate against Mr. Trump \u2014 in which he repeatedly struggled to complete his sentences \u2014 reignited worries about his age, leading to Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race amid pressure from his party.",
      "Biden's decisions during that period have drawn new scrutiny in recent weeks, as books that offer glimpses inside his campaign hit the shelves. Some of the books describe Biden's struggles with age, his aides' maneuvers to keep him in the race and the abrupt shift from Biden to eventual nominee Kamala Harris weeks after the Trump-Biden debate.",
      "Biden has strongly denied any lapses in his cognitive ability, telling \"The View\" last week, \"there's nothing to sustain that.\"",

We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI Director and we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich wrote in his own social media post Comey's message \"can clearly be interpreted as 'a hit' on the sitting President of the United States,\" and said it is \"being taken seriously.\"",
      "Trump responds",
      "In an interview with Fox News, the president claimed Comey knew \"exactly what that meant\" when he posted the image on Instagram. \"That meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear,\" Mr. Trump told Fox's Bret Baier. He also called the post \"a terrible thing\" and Comey a \"dirty cop.\"",
      "When asked what the response to Comey's post should be, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't want to take a position on it because that's going to be up to Pam and all of the great people,\" referring to Attorney General Pam Bondi.",

      "That firing ultimately set into motion Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a \"hoax.\"",

      "Mr. Trump was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidential campaign last year. During a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a 20-year-old gunman opened fire on Mr. Trump, grazing his ear with a bullet. One rally attendee was killed and two more were wounded.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 18:37:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

      "The fire that engulfed the Nottoway Plantation House on Thursday devastated the building along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Iberville Parish President Chris Daigle said on social media. Nearly a dozen fire departments from surrounding towns battled the blaze, he said. No injuries were reported.",
      "Its website describes it as \"the South's largest remaining antebellum mansion.\" Daigle called it \"a cornerstone of our tourism economy and a site of national significance.\"",
      "Nottoway Plantation was built in the 1850s by John Hampden Randolph and sits on a 31-acre property in White Castle, on the edge of the Mississippi River.",
      "The 53,000-square-foot home on a former sugar plantation about 65 miles northwest of New Orleans had a three-story rotunda adorned with giant white columns and hand-carved Italian marble fireplaces, according to a description on its website.",
      "Up until the fire, the mansion was used as a museum and wedding and event venue.",
      "The mansion's owner, Louisiana attorney Dan Dyess, said in a written statement that the fire had led to a \"total loss\" after all the time and money he invested in the building.",
      "\"We are devastated and heartbroken for this loss,\" he said. \"This was my dream that has now been dashed.\"",
      "Photos from local news outlets showed a giant orange wall of fire consuming the upper portion of the rotunda and sending a plume of thick smoke into the sky.",
      "The fire has been contained, and no other properties were harmed, said Maj. Monty Migliacio of the Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office. Other structures on the grounds have been preserved, parish officials said.",
      "\"We are at the beginning phases of the investigation, we don't know how the fire began and our objective is to determine how it started,\" Louisiana Office of State Fire Marshal Public Affairs Director Ken Pastorick said.",
      "In a statement on Facebook, Daigle touched on the structure's history of racial injustice during a time when enslaved Black people helped build the home and operate the sugar plantation that surrounded it. In 1860, 155 enslaved people were held at the property, according to National Park Service records.",
      "\"While its early history is undeniably tied to a time of great injustice, over the last several decades it evolved into a place of reflection, education, and dialogue,\" Daigle said.",
      "\"Since the 1980s, it has welcomed visitors from around the world who came to appreciate its architecture and confront the legacies of its era,\" he added. \"It stood as both a cautionary monument and a testament to the importance of preserving history \u2014 even the painful parts \u2014 so that future generations can learn and grow from it.\"",

      "Fujirebio's test works with the company's Lumipulse equipment, which the company says is already \"widely available in clinical laboratories\" around the U.S. Fujirebio describes Lumipulse as a \"fully automated\" system that can run 120 tests an hour on blood and other samples.",
      "The test works by measuring two kinds of proteins in the blood that are associated with whether the brain has built up amyloid plaques, which research has linked to Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"Today's clearance is an important step for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for U.S. patients earlier in the disease,\" Dr. Michelle Tarver, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.",
      "Not all people should take Fujirebio's new test. The FDA says that it is \"intended for patients presenting at a specialized care setting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline\" and is limited for adults ages 55 and older.",
      "The agency says that Fujirebio submitted data from a study of 499 blood plasma samples of adults who had cognitive impairment, comparing the results from the blood test with the alternative ways that doctors can check for amyloid plaques building up in the head: brain scans and tests of spinal fluid.",
      "In 91.7% of studied patients who tested positive in their blood, they also had amyloid plaques that showed up in a brain scan or a test of spinal fluid. The share of negative results that matched with these other tests was also high, at 97.3% of patients.",
      "\"We designed our Lumipulse G pTau 217/\u03b2-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio test to help physicians and patients with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline obtain an AD diagnosis much earlier when interventions are more effective,\" Fujirebio said in a release last year, after it submitted its regulatory filing to the FDA for the test.",
      "The FDA's sign-off on marketing for Fujirebio's test comes years after other blood tests for Alzheimer's have already begun sales, without this kind of approval from the agency.",
      "Experts have been wary about some previous blood tests for diagnosing Alzheimer's, which were being sold under different regulations that govern tests that are created by individual laboratories doing high complexity testing.",
      "Last year under the Biden administration, the agency had sought to crack down on these other \"laboratory developed tests\" being sold to diagnose Alzheimer's and other health issues, which FDA officials argued should be subject to stricter federal oversight.",
      "\"The FDA's approach was developed half a century ago when tests made and used in single labs were generally simple, often made to address local individual needs, and mostly manufactured in small volumes,\" federal health officials said in January.",
      "In defending the move, the FDA cited as an example a past submission from a test that failed to earn the agency's marketing authorization for helping to diagnose Alzheimer's, but was still able to be sold in the U.S. market by the laboratory.",
      "\"Many treatable conditions have symptoms similar to AD or another form of dementia. Without sufficient information to demonstrate adequate validation, a test's performance is unknown, which may put patients at risk of harm due to inaccurate results,\" the agency said.",
      "A lawsuit backed by the American Clinical Laboratory Association successfully challenged the FDA's new rule on the laboratory developed tests, persuading a federal judge in Texas earlier this year to toss out the regulation.",

      "Starbucks'\u00a0new dress code for baristas has sparked a strike at 75 U.S. stores, with more than 1,000 workers protesting the new policy, a union representing the coffee giant's workers said Wednesday.",
      "The new dress code, which went into effect on Monday, requires employees at company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada to wear a solid black shirt and khaki, black or blue denim bottoms under their green apron.",
      "Under the previous dress code, baristas could wear a broader range of dark colors and patterned shirts. Starbucks said the new rules would make its green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers as it tries to establish a warmer, more welcoming feeling in its stores.",
      "The new dress code comes as the company works on its\u00a0\"Back to Starbucks\"\u00a0mission, aimed at revitalizing its cafes and boosting sales. CEO Brian Niccol, who was brought on from Chipotle to lead the coffee chain\u00a0last year, has said \"there's a shared sense that we have drifted from our core.\"",
      "But Starbucks Workers United, the union that represents workers at 570 of Starbucks' 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores, said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 16:34:13 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",

    "published": "Sat, 17 May 2025 14:38:27 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced this week he will drop sanctions on Syria \u2014 surprising some senior U.S. sanctions officials, sources tell CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For the leaders of Syria's transitional government, President Trump's announcement earlier this week that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country came as a relief after months of intense lobbying for a reprieve.",
      "\"I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\" Mr. Trump said at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday.",
      "But inside the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy, the announcement came as a surprise to senior officials, sources tell CBS News.",
      "The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant.",
      "Now, there are discussions inside Treasury to determine the speed and extent to which the decades-old sanctions \u2014 which restrict economic activity within Syria and its dealings with other countries \u2014 can be rolled back.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said Friday, \"President Trump is the Commander-in-Chief and the Treasury Department is in lockstep to execute his historic vision to bring peace and stability back to the Middle East.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was traveling with the president, was aware of the announcement and part of the decision-making process.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that he was with Mr. Trump when he decided to include the announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria in his speech in Riyadh. Rubio did not say when the president made the decision.",
      "\"This is something that had been discussed, worked on, options considered for many weeks leading up to this announcement and that we are going to be implementing what the president has announced as an administration,\" State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.",
      "Indeed, Syria's transitional government \u2014 led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa \u2014 has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief in recent months.",
      "The new government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for its inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.-designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion.",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration led an international effort to isolate Syria \u2014 culminating in multiple rounds of sanctions \u2014 as Assad's army fought a bloody civil war against rebel forces that led to half a million dead Syrians.",
      "Another package of sanctions was imposed in 2019 as part of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, also known as the \"Caesar Act\" which Mr. Trump signed into law. The bill imposed stiff sanctions on Assad's government and companies or governments that worked with it, further crippling Syria's already isolated economy.",
      "Rubio indicated in his remarks in Turkey that relief may come in the form of waivers that give permission to do business in Syria without facing penalties for evading sanctions, which the administration can issue under authorities in the \"Caesar Act.\"",
      "\"I think we want to start with the initial waiver, which will allow foreign partners who wanted to flow in aid to begin to do so without running the risk of sanctions,\" Rubio said. He also suggested that the Trump Administration may be in a position \"soon\" to ask lawmakers to permanently repeal some sanctions."

      "Calligraphy by a South Korean independence hero, created while awaiting execution for assassinating a Japanese leader, is breaking new auction records in Seoul, as the country's ultra-rich seek to bring historic artwork home.",
      "Revered in the South for his efforts to defend the country against Japanese encroachment, Ahn Jung-geun is best known for his dramatic, high-stakes assassination of Japan's first prime minister, Ito Hirobumi, in 1909 at a train station in Harbin. Ahn shouted \"Hurrah for Korea!\" as he was arrested, according to the Association for Asian Studies based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.",
      "He was hanged for the killing by Japanese authorities in 1910, just months before Tokyo formally annexed the Korean Peninsula, ushering in a brutal period of occupation that lasted until the end of World War II.",
      "Now, more than a century after his death, the calligraphy Ahn created in his prison cell during his final days \u2014 typically at the request of Japanese officials \u2014 is drawing fresh attention in Seoul's glitzy art scene.",
      "In South Korea, Ahn's life has long inspired artists across generations, giving rise to a highly celebrated musical, multiple novels, and films \u2014 including one starring \"Crash Landing on You\" actor Hyun Bin.",
      "Ahn was held in his prison cell in China for about 40 days leading up to his execution and he kept himself busy writing an autobiography and making hundreds of calligraphy pieces, including one requested by his own prison guard.",
      "\"The court and prison officials, saying they wanted to keep my calligraphy as a memento, brought me hundreds of sheets of silk and paper and asked me to create for them,\" Ahn wrote in his autobiography. \"I ended up spending several hours each day doing calligraphy, even though I wasn't particularly skilled in it.\"",
      "Even though Ahn had assassinated their top official Ito, the Japanese who took his calligraphy preserved them with care, and some of their descendants have donated them to the South Korean government, which subsequently designated them as national treasures.",
      "Now, more of the calligraphies are surfacing in the private art market, with the latest being auctioned last month in Seoul for 940 million won ($674,098) \u2014 more than three times its opening bid.",
      "The piece, which says \"green bamboo\" \u2014 a traditional symbol of integrity \u2014 had been owned by a Japanese individual who did not wish to be identified, and they had done an impeccable job preserving it, said Kim Jun-seon, art valuation specialist at Seoul Auction.",
      "\"It wasn't even mounted and was still rolled up, but when we opened the case, the scent of ink still lingered in the air,\" she told AFP.",
      "\"Misguided but principled idealist\"",
      "Japan said Ahn was a criminal and terrorist and refused to hand over his remains. They have never been located.",
      "Moves to honor Ahn by Seoul and Beijing have previously strained ties with Tokyo, even briefly sparking a diplomatic row in 2013.",
      "In 2014, Japan criticized a memorial built in China to commemorate Ahn, BBC News reported. A Japanese government spokesman branded him a terrorist after the Chinese-Korean memorial hall opened in China's Harbin city, where Ito was shot.",
      "The fact that his Japanese captors preserved his calligraphy \"reflects the cultural and political contradictions of early 20th century East Asia,\" said Eugene Y. Park, a history professor at University of Nevada, Reno.",
      "At his trial, Ahn identified himself as a soldier for Korea, defined his assassination of Ito as a military operation, and envisioned a united East Asia \u2014 comprising Korea, China and Japan \u2014 somewhat akin to today's European Union.",
      "\"Some Japanese may have seen him as a misguided but principled idealist,\" Park told AFP.",
      "His calligraphy, which focused on values such as peace and ethics, \"resonated culturally, even if he opposed them politically,\" he said.",
      "\"At a time when Japan's own imperial identity was unsettled, preserving his works revealed deeper tensions between respect for moral courage and the pursuit of colonial domination.\"",
      "In 2023, the Global Sae-A Group, a South Korean conglomerate, purchased one of Ahn's calligraphies for a record-breaking 1.95 billion won (nearly $1.4 million).",
      "The piece \"Green Bamboo\" was sold at auction last month to the family of South Korea's LS Group.",
      "\"We expressed our intention to bring the piece back to Korea and share it with the public,\" Joung Tae-hee at Seoul Auction said, adding that the Japanese owner agreed to sell after hearing their proposal.",
      "Lee Sang-hyun, of the LS Group family, told AFP that his mother \"hopes many citizens will be able to see this piece and that it will also be studied,\" and they are considering donating it to a national institution.",
      "Ahn became a Catholic as a teenager and ends his autobiography with the words of Nicolas Joseph Marie Wilhelm, a French priest and missionary stationed in Korea, who traveled to his prison to see the activist and give him confession.",
      "The priest \u2014 who had also baptized Ahn and was a longtime friend \u2014 was disciplined for his trip, and was later forced to return to France.",
      "\"The gracious lord will never abandon you,\" Wilhelm told Ahn. \"He will surely take you in, so rest your heart and go in peace.\"",

      "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\u00a0\u2014 President Trump said Friday that he's moving to set up direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as he can, after Putin opted to skip peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey.",
      "\"I think it's time for us to just do it,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he wrapped a four-day visit to the Middle East. Later, he told reporters on Air Force One, setting off on the journey back to Washington, that he might call Putin soon.",
      "\"He and I will meet, and I think we'll solve it or maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said. \"At least we'll know. And if we don't solve it, it'll be very interesting.\"",
      "The president reiterated that he wasn't surprised by Putin's decision to skip the talks taking place Friday in Turkey. Putin didn't want to go because he's not there, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Meetings between Ukrainian and Russian delegations did get underway in Istanbul Friday, though Putin sent a lower-level delegation. This prompted accusations from Ukraine and its European partners that Moscow wasn't really interested in a negotiated resolution to the war.",
      "After the meetings concluded, Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation, said in a statement that the two countries agreed that \"in the coming days,\" they'll hold a large-scale exchange of 1,000 prisoners of war for each side. He also said Russia has \"taken notice\" of Ukraine's request for direct talks between the heads of state, and that each side \"would present its vision of a possible future ceasefire.\" Once the detailed outlines are presented, negotiations will continue.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would hold a meeting with Putin, \"as soon as we can set it up.\"",
      "\"I would actually leave here and go,\" he said, noting that his daughter Tiffany just gave birth to her first child. \"I do want to see my beautiful grandson.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to take part in the talks as Mr. Trump pressed for the leaders to find a solution to the war, ongoing since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But Putin spurned the call to meet face-to-face with Zelenskyy.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to an agreement to end the war. Zelenskyy has agreed to an American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, but Russia has not signed on and has continued to strike at targets inside Ukraine.",
      "\"He didn't go, and I understand that,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of Putin's decision to skip the talks in Istanbul. \"We're going to get it done. We got to get it done. Five thousand young people are being killed every single week on average, and we're going to get it done.\"",
      "The U.S. president told reporters on Thursday that a meeting between himself and Putin was crucial to breaking the deadlock.",
      "\"I don't believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But we're going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Moscow on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any meeting between Putin and Mr. Trump would have to be \"well prepared\" for, but he said such an encounter was indeed necessary in Russia's view, as \"a serious conversation on international issues is needed, including the Ukrainian crisis.\"",
      "Should the talks in Istanbul fail to make any progress, Zelenskyy said Friday that there should be a \"strong reaction,\" as it would be clear, in his view, that Russia does not have any interest in ending the war.",

      "The social media influencer who was shot dead during a livestream on TikTok in the Mexican state of Jalisco appeared to be murdered by a hit man and expressed fear before being killed, prosecutors said on Thursday.",
      "The grisly murder of 23-year-old Valeria M\u00e1rquez on Tuesday shocked the Latin American nation, igniting rumors about the motive behind her killing in a region that's been eclipsed by cartel violence in recent years. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her administration is working with local investigators to track down the killer and extended her condolences to M\u00e1rquez's family.",
      "Denis Rodr\u00edguez, a spokesperson for the Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office, provided new details on the killing on Thursday, but said prosecutors were still investigating the death of the model and beauty influencer with more than 113,000 followers on the social media app.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez said that early Tuesday afternoon, hours before the shooting, a masked man posing as a delivery driver arrived at the beauty salon on the outskirts of Guadalajara, accompanied by another man on a motorcycle. According to a woman in the salon, the men said they had a \"very expensive\" gift for M\u00e1rquez that they had to deliver in person. When M\u00e1rquez arrived and heard people were looking for her she expressed fear in her livestream.",
      "\"Maybe they were going to kill me,\" she said in the video minutes before she was killed. \"Were they going to come and take me away, or what? I'm worried.\"",
      "When the men returned, they asked if it was M\u00e1rquez who was now in the salon, something that prompted prosecutors to believe that the men were hired assassins, Rodr\u00edguez said.",
      "\"The aggressor arrived asking if the victim (M\u00e1rquez) was there. So it appears he didn't know her,\" Rodr\u00edguez said. \"With that, you can deduce \u2014 without jumping to conclusions \u2014 that this was a person who was paid. It was obviously someone who came with a purpose.\"",

      "M\u00e1rquez was handed a stuffed animal and a bag of Starbucks coffee while she was on the livestream, and was shot in the head and the chest, collapsing on camera. TikTok has since taken down the influencer's account.",

      "In January, a small plane was reported to have dropped pamphlets on the northwestern cartel stronghold of Culiacan threatening around 20 artists and YouTubers for alleged dealings with a warring faction of the Sinaloa drug cartel.",

      "David Saucedo, an independent expert on Mexican cartels, said people who have fallen afoul of the gangs include informants, money launderers and those in romantic relationships with criminals.",
      "\"Influencers have become another cog in the machine of organized crime,\" he said.",
      "Zapopan mayor Juan Jose Frangie said that his office has no record of Marquez requesting help from authorities because of threats against her.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 19:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this week criticized White South Africans who claimed refugee status in the U.S. as \"cowardly.\"",
    "story": [
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the White House next week, his office said Thursday, days after the arrival in the U.S. of the\u00a0first group of White South Africans, having been granted refugee status under a new Trump administration policy.",
      "Ramaphosa's office said the visit will provide a \"platform to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries.\" The statement said Rampahosa, who is the current president of the G20, and President Trump will meet on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "The White House has not yet commented on the meeting.",
      "The visit comes amid renewed tensions between Ramaphosa and the White House as 59 people from South Africa's Afrikaner community\u00a0arrived in the U.S.\u00a0earlier this week. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landeau said upon their arrival in Washington that they had faced \"egregious discrimination\" in South Africa.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the Afrikaners a \"vulnerable group facing unjust racial discrimination in South Africa.\"",
      "Ramaphosa rejected the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as \"not true,\" according to BBC News.",
      "On Tuesday, Ramaphosa called those leaving for the U.S. \"cowardly,\" saying, \"When you run away you are a coward.\"",
      "Who are Afrikaners?",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of the 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "In 1948, as South Africa was in the process of gaining independence from Britain, the White minority created the system of apartheid, allowing only White South Africans to vote and govern. As well as being denied political power, Black South Africans also faced harsh restrictions on owning land and many were forcibly segregated into settlements.",
      "That ended in 1994, when all South Africans were allowed to vote for the first time, leading to the end of minority White rule. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won a majority, and he became the country's first Black president. The ANC has been in power since 1994, but scandals have harmed the party in recent years and it did not win a majority in the 2024 election, forcing Ramaphosa to form a coalition government.",
      "Thirty years after apartheid ended, White South Africans on average still enjoy a higher standard of living than Black South Africans, with research from the South Africa Human Rights Commission showing just 1% of White South Africans are considered poor, compared to 64% of the Black African population.",
      "Why are Afrikaners claiming refugee status?",
      "In February, Ramaphosa signed a new law that allowed the state to seize land without compensation, in situations classified under the legislation as \"just and equitable and in the public interest.\"",
      "Although the wording of the law was vague and did not reference White South Africans, many believed it was targeting them since they control most of the country's land. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination, saying the law targets land not being used or not serving the public interest.",
      "Some have also pointed to attacks on South African farmers in recent years. U.S Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who met the first group of Afrikaners admitted to the country, recently claimed they faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government, however, has said those attacks were a result of border crime issues and were not racially motivated.",
      "Mr. Trump and adviser Elon Musk, who is a White South African native, have claimed the attacks and potential loss of land amounts to \"White genocide.\"",
      "In February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to prioritize the resettlement of Afrikaners under the refugee resettlement program. Access to that program for many other groups was frozen by Mr. Trump on his first day in office, although that executive order allowed for exemptions to be considered on a case-by-case basis.",
      "While Afrikaners make up only about half of South Africa's White population, Mr. Trump's executive order granting refugee status only mentions Afrikaners.",
      "According to the U.S. embassy in South Africa, individuals who meet the following requirements can apply for refugee stays:",
      "Must be of South African nationality; and\u00a0Must be of Afrikaner ethnicity or be a member of a racial minority in South Africa; and\u00a0Must be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of future persecution.",

Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor.",

      "Diaw said Brown, who was on a U.K. tour at the time, cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",
      "Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as \"Run It,\" \"Kiss Kiss\" and \"Without You.\" He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for \"F.A.M.E.\" then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for \"11:11 (Deluxe)\" earlier this year.",
      "Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas.",
      "Earlier this year, Brown sued Warner Bros. Discovery for defamation over labeling the singer as an abuser in the 2024 documentary \"Chris Brown: A History of Violence.\"",

      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.",

      "While GLP-1 RAs are \"wonderful tools\" that can support people on weight-loss journeys, Savery pointed out that maintaining a healthy lifestyle through nutritious eating and regular physical activity is \"the foundation for cancer prevention and better overall health.\" (iStock)",

      "\"He was lawfully detained? No he wasn\u2019t!\" Judge Xinis objected. \"There was no order of removal, there was no warrant for removal \u2013 there was nothing.\"",
      "She cut off Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn again when he attempted to continue with a different argument. \"You didn\u2019t even respond to what I just said,\" she told him. \"A DHS attorney came in at the first hearing and confirmed that there was no lawful basis to arrest Abrego Garcia.\"",

      "\"Because there's actually the [Immigration and Naturalization Act], which says that if the United States elects to remove someone to a third country, there's a process. Congress has set out that process, the executive has to follow that process.,\" she said. \"So it is not determined yet whether removal to a third country would be appropriate, which is why the Supreme Court ruled the way it did.\"",
      "Ultimately, she said, the government will likely have extra time to file additional declarations to allow it to seek the state secrets privilege.",
      "Still, she said she \"has to point out\" that the unlawful removal of Abrego Garcia from the U.S. \"is a foregone conclusion.\"",

One significant advantage of cloud storage is accessing files from any device with an internet connection, whether on your phone, tablet or another computer.",

      "5. Regularly update your operating system and applications: Keep your devices and software\u00a0up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public networks, or use a VPN for added security. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Backup your data regularly: Create\u00a0multiple backups of your important files, including at least one offline copy.",
      "8. Use secure file transfer methods: When sharing files, use encrypted transfer methods or\u00a0password-protected links.",
      "By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your data and protect yourself from potential cyber threats.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Your PC\u2019s storage can fill up fast, but you can always free up some space. I personally prefer storing images and videos that take up too much space on an external drive. This way, I can access them whenever I need to while keeping my PC storage free. If an external drive feels like too much of a hassle, you can always opt for cloud storage.

      "Health information data brokers collect information about your general health and sell it to companies in healthcare and related fields. This information can be used to target you with health product ads and even set your insurance premiums.",
      "Hackers are most likely to use people search sites, though; they are easily accessible, eminently searchable, relatively cheap (with trial offers for as little as a dollar) and do not ask any questions.

It rides on a 108.9-inch wheelbase and features a five-foot bed that is slightly longer and wider than the Maverick's, offering 37 cubic feet of cargo space. The truck is powered by a single rear-mounted electric motor producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, delivering rear-wheel drive only and accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in about 8 seconds, with a top speed near 90 mph.",

Charging is flexible, with an 11 kW onboard AC charger and DC fast charging up to 120 kW through a NACS connector, allowing a 20% to 80% charge in about half an hour. The Slate Truck has a maximum payload capacity of 1,433 pounds and can tow up to 1,000 pounds, making it practical for everyday hauling needs.",

The vehicle\u2019s exterior can be wrapped in different colors and designs instead of painted, allowing owners to easily change its look or even do it themselves with a DIY kit.

      "How this scam works",
      "This type of scam is known as a remote access scam. It often begins with a fake email that appears to come from a trusted company like PayPal. The message claims there is an issue, such as an unauthorized charge, and urges the victim to call a phone number or click a link.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the scammer makes contact, they guide the victim to enter a code into their browser or install a program, claiming it will fix the problem. In reality, this grants the scammer full control of the victim\u2019s computer.",
      "Once inside, scammers often search for sensitive files, access banking websites, steal login credentials or install malware to maintain long-term access. Even if the immediate scam is stopped, hidden malware can allow scammers to reenter the system later.",

      "Fake emails are harder to spot than ever: Scammers create emails that look almost identical to real ones from trusted companies like PayPal. They copy logos, formatting and even fake customer support numbers. Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address and verify communications by visiting the official website or app directly instead of clicking links inside emails.",
      "Remote access scams can escalate fast: Once scammers gain control of your device, they can steal sensitive data, move funds between accounts and install hidden malware that stays behind even after the scammer disconnects. It often takes only minutes for serious damage to be done, making fast recognition critical.",
      "Psychological pressure plays a big role: Scammers rely on creating a sense of urgency and fear. By keeping you on the phone and urging secrecy, they isolate you from help and rush you into making bad decisions. Recognizing when you are being pressured is key to breaking the scammer\u2019s control.",
      "Fast action can make all the difference: By quickly disconnecting his computer and contacting his bank, John limited the scammer\u2019s access to his accounts.

      "Taking simple but strong security steps can protect you from falling victim.",
      "1. Never call a number listed in a suspicious email: Scammers often set up fake phone numbers that sound professional but are designed to manipulate you into handing over control or information. Always find verified contact information through a company's official website or app, not links/numbers provided in suspicious messages.",
      "2. Be skeptical of unusual instructions: No legitimate company will ask you to install software or enter strange codes to protect your account. If anything seems unusual, trust your instincts and stop the communication immediately.",
      "3. Install strong antivirus software on all devices:\u00a0Antivirus programs can detect suspicious downloads, block remote access attempts and help prevent hackers from taking over your system. Having strong antivirus protection installed across all your devices is the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and attempt to access your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use identity theft protection: These services monitor financial accounts, credit reports and online activity for signs of fraud, alerting you to suspicious transactions.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. React immediately if you suspect a scam: Disconnect your device from the internet, contact your bank or credit card company immediately and change your passwords, especially for banking and email accounts. Monitor your accounts closely for unauthorized activity and report the scam to the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission as well as the company that was impersonated. Acting quickly can prevent further access and limit the damage scammers can cause.",
      "6. Use multifactor authentication (MFA):\u00a0MFA adds a critical layer of security beyond passwords, blocking unauthorized logins even if credentials are stolen. Enable MFA on all accounts, especially banking, email and payment platforms, to stop scammers from bypassing stolen passwords.",
      "7. Update devices and software immediately:\u00a0Regular updates patch security flaws that scammers exploit to install malware or hijack systems. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible to ensure you\u2019re always protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities.",
      "8. Employ a password manager with strong, unique passwords: Avoid password reuse and use complex passphrases to minimize credential-stuffing attacks. A\u00a0password manager generates and stores uncrackable passwords, eliminating the risk of weak or repeated credentials. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "9. Never share screen access or grant remote control: Scammers exploit screen-sharing tools to steal passwords and manipulate transactions in real time. Legitimate tech support will never demand unsolicited screen access; terminate the call immediately if pressured.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0These services automate requests to delete your personal information from data brokers and people-search sites, reducing publicly available details scammers could exploit for phishing or impersonation. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says hackers are using CAPTCHAs to infect your PC with malware.",
      "Ransomware gangs once thrived on infected email attachments and bogus invoices, but security-savvy users and hardened mail gateways have weakened those tactics. Attackers are now focusing on a subtler trick that targets the small checkbox labeled \"I'm not a robot\" that most people click without thinking.",
      "A widespread campaign known as MacReaper has compromised more than 2,800 legitimate websites and redirects visitors to an infection process designed specifically for Apple computers. The operation relies on visual trust signals, including a convincing fake of Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA, along with hidden clipboard code that ends with the installation of Atomic macOS Stealer malware, a data-harvesting infostealer distributed through Telegram.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does the attack unfold?",
      "When a Mac user visits one of the compromised websites, they don't see the page they were expecting. Instead, the site displays a full-screen imitation of Google's familiar reCAPTCHA box.",
      "This fake reCAPTCHA appears harmless, simply asking the user to click \"I'm not a robot.\" However, when the user clicks the box, a hidden command is silently copied to their clipboard. Immediately afterward, the page displays a friendly message, complete with familiar macOS keyboard shortcut visuals, explicitly instructing the user to open Terminal and paste what they've just copied. If the user follows these instructions, the command downloads and runs the malicious file known as Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS).",
      "This trick is specifically targeted at Mac users. The website checks the visitor's operating system and only activates the attack if it detects macOS. For Windows or Linux users, the site behaves normally. Researchers have dubbed this infection method \"ClickFix,\" referencing the single click that initiates the attack chain.",
      "At the center of this campaign is AMOS, a sophisticated piece of malware that has become notorious in cybercrime circles. AMOS is available for rent on Telegram, with some versions costing attackers up to $3,000 per month. Once installed, AMOS can steal a wide array of sensitive data: it can extract Wi-Fi and app passwords stored in Keychain, collect browser cookies and autofill data, list system information and scan through personal folders such as Desktop and Documents. It is also capable of identifying and targeting more than 50 types of cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "Fake reCAPTCHA (Cyber Security News) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Domains and sites compromised in the MacReaper campaign",
      "Several cybersecurity reports have identified specific domains involved in the attack infrastructure. Notably, domains such as\u00a0technavix.cloud and\u00a0salorttactical.top have been highlighted as part of the malicious network distributing AMOS. The campaign's initial discovery traced back to a compromised Brazilian news site,\u00a0agencia2.jornalfloripa.com.br, which served as an early infection vector before the operation expanded to more than 2,800 legitimate websites worldwide.",
      "Macs aren't as secure as Apple wants you to believe",
      "MacReaper challenges two widely held beliefs. The first is that everyday CAPTCHA checks are just harmless speed bumps. The second is that macOS provides a level of built-in security that keeps most attackers at bay. In reality, a single click can expose Keychain credentials, active browser sessions and cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "These are exactly the kinds of targets that attract credential-stuffing groups and profit-driven cybercriminals. Because the attack is triggered by the user, many network monitoring tools treat the traffic as normal, leaving security teams with little to investigate. In environments where Macs and Windows machines share identity systems, one compromised Mac can open access to single sign-on portals, cloud storage and even production codebases.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of the MacReaper attack, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures.",
      "1) Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to copy commands or paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2) Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many MacReaper attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6) Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from MacReaper or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "MacReaper makes it clear that the most durable exploits aren't zero-days but borrowed moments of trust, an authentic-looking CAPTCHA, a helpful-sounding fix, a clipboard that does what it's told. As Apple tightens the technical screws with Rapid Security Responses and notarization, expect adversaries to double down on such psychological levers. The counter-strategy is to hard-bake healthy skepticism into user behavior and to instrument Macs with the same telemetry layers enterprises already expect from Windows. Security, in other words, has finally become a platform-agnostic muscle, and complacency is the riskiest operating system of all.",

      "Fake banking apps and mobile trojans: Some apps are designed to look exactly like your bank\u2019s official app, but they\u2019re actually fakes. If you enter your login info, it goes straight to the scammer. Even more advanced are\u00a0mobile banking trojans, which hide inside seemingly unrelated apps. Once installed, the trojan watches for when you open your real banking app and then quickly overlays a fake login screen. If you type in your credentials, the trojan grabs them and sends them off to the attacker.",
      "Phishing scams: Scammers\u00a0send emails or texts that appear to be from your bank, asking you to verify a transaction or log in to resolve an issue. These messages often include links to websites that look identical to your bank\u2019s site but are actually fakes. The giveaway is often a small detail, like a misspelled URL. For example, \"captial0ne.com\" instead of \"capitalone.com.\"",
      "Keyloggers:\u00a0Keyloggers are a type of malware that silently records everything you type. If one gets onto your device, it can capture your banking username, password and anything else you type, all without you knowing.",
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks:\u00a0These attacks happen when hackers intercept the data being transmitted between you and your bank\u2019s website. This is especially risky if you\u2019re on\u00a0public Wi-Fi. You may think you're logging in securely, but a hacker could be watching everything or even redirecting you to a fake version of your bank's site.",
      "SIM swapping:\u00a0SIM swapping is where a scammer contacts your phone provider, pretends to be you and asks to transfer your number to a new SIM card. If successful, they receive your text messages, including any verification codes sent by your bank. This gives them access to your account, even if two-factor authentication is turned on.",

      "This is where it gets unsettling. In rare cases, hackers can actually make it look like your bank balance hasn\u2019t changed, even though they\u2019ve already taken the money. How? By targeting the display layer of your banking app or web interface. If malware is installed on your device, it can manipulate what shows up on the screen. That means your balance might look normal, while your actual funds are long gone. This type of attack is extremely rare and usually requires access to a compromised or jailbroken device, but it\u2019s technically possible and just sophisticated enough to delay you from realizing what happened.",

      "The good news? You don\u2019t need to be a cybersecurity expert to protect yourself. Just following these key steps can dramatically reduce your risk.",
      "1) Use official apps only: Cybercriminals will try to trick you with fake banking apps and mobile trojans that overlay fake login screens, so it\u2019s critical to download banking apps exclusively from the Apple App Store or Google Play. Never install apps from links in emails or texts.",
      "2) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): SIM-swapping attacks can hijack your phone number and intercept SMS codes, so enable app-based\u00a02FA to block unauthorized logins even if hackers obtain your password.",
      "3) Get text or app alerts: Hackers can manipulate your account\u2019s display to hide stolen funds, so set up real-time transaction alerts to expose unauthorized withdrawals immediately, especially for microtransactions used to test your account.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords: Phishing scams and keyloggers often harvest weak or reused credentials, so use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Avoid clicking suspicious links and install strong antivirus software: Scammers impersonate banks with phishing emails/texts containing misspelled URLs (e.g., \"captial0ne.com\"), so always navigate directly to your bank\u2019s official website or app instead of clicking embedded links. Strong antivirus software helps protect your devices from fake apps, keyloggers and other threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Check your accounts regularly: Don\u2019t just glance at your balance. Review recent transactions at least once a week to catch any suspicious activity.",
      "7) Avoid public Wi-Fi for banking: Hackers exploit unsecured networks to launch man-in-the-middle attacks and spoof banking sites, so use a VPN to encrypt your connection if you must bank on public Wi-Fi. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "8) Use a personal data removal service: Data brokers sell your contact details and personal information, which hackers can use for targeted phishing attacks or SIM swap scams. These services automatically remove your data from broker databases, reducing the risk of social engineering attempts that could compromise your bank account.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Hackers don\u2019t need to break into your bank\u2019s system; they just need to trick you. Whether it\u2019s phishing, malware or SIM swaps, the goal is always the same: get access to your login and verification codes. Fortunately, you can make it much harder for them by using secure habits and staying alert. Your money belongs with you, not in the hands of a scammer.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says AT\u00b2 Aerospace\u2019s Z1 hybrid airship uses helium lift, low fuel, no runways.",
      "The tragic Hindenburg disaster of 1937, which resulted in the death of 36 people and effectively ended passenger airship travel, cast a long-lasting shadow over lighter-than-air technology. For many decades, airships were largely confined to niche roles such as advertising and surveillance.",
      "However, a groundbreaking spin-off from Lockheed Martin to AT\u00b2 Aerospace is now reviving the airship concept with a modern twist: hybrid airships designed specifically for eco-friendly cargo transport. Most recently, AT\u00b2 Aerospace announced two purchase orders for their airships, one from Straightline Aviation and one from Arctic Airships.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The Z1 hybrid airship",
      "At the center of this revival is the Z1 hybrid airship, a massive vessel capable of carrying up to 23.5 tons (21 metric tons) of cargo while minimizing environmental impacts and significantly reducing fuel consumption compared to traditional aircraft. Unlike the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, which was highly flammable, the Z1 relies on helium for lift, a nonflammable gas, providing buoyancy for the majority of the airship's weight, combined with aerodynamic design and advanced propulsion systems.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MASSIVE AIRSHIP COULD SHAKE UP CARGO TRANSPORT",
      "How the Z1 hybrid airship works",
      "The Z1 combines lighter-than-air buoyancy with advanced engineering innovations. Notably, the aircraft features a tri-lobe hull design, a hallmark of Lockheed Martin's earlier airship projects. This design includes a raised central lobe flanked by two side lobes, which enhances lift efficiency and stability. Its Air Cushion Landing System allows it to take off and land on virtually any flat surface, including sand, ice, water or uneven terrain, eliminating the need for traditional runways.",
      "The Z1 uses vectored thrust propulsion and advanced onboard systems for weather prediction and route planning, enabling it to travel more than 1,400 nautical miles at speeds of up to 60 knots. The hybrid lift system merges helium's natural buoyancy with vectored thrust from the engines, optimizing both efficiency and control. This innovative design reduces fuel consumption to just one-fifth of what a heavy-lift helicopter would use, making the Z1 especially suited for transporting goods to remote and difficult-to-access areas such as the Arctic or the Amazon rainforest.",

      "ZERO EMISSIONS HYDROGEN ELECTRIC JET DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS",
      "Why it matters",
      "The Z1 addresses two pressing challenges in modern transportation. First, it offers a practical solution for accessing remote regions where traditional cargo planes and helicopters face high costs and infrastructure limitations. Its ability to land without airstrips unlocks affordable transport options for industries like mining, disaster relief and medical supply delivery in isolated communities.",
      "Second, the Z1 contributes to the urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions. Transports such as cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes currently account for over 40% of worldwide carbon emissions, and the Z1's low fuel consumption and ability to overfly environmentally sensitive areas quietly present a scalable alternative for freight transport with minimized environmental impact.",

      "IS THIS 656-FOOT AIRYACHT THE LUXURY TRANSPORTATION OF THE FUTURE?",

      "The recent $50 million order from Straightline Aviation demonstrates strong confidence in the Z1's commercial potential, with the first delivery expected by 2028. Arctic Airships has also placed orders for two airships, targeting operations in Alaska's challenging terrain.",
      "\"Our hybrid airships will transform cargo transport by providing an environmentally responsible solution while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Dr. Bob Boyd, CEO of AT\u00b2 Aerospace. He went on to say,\u00a0\"Our aircraft not only optimizes cargo movement in challenging terrains but also aligns with the industry's increasing focus on environmental responsibility and cost efficiency.\"",

By blending tried-and-true lighter-than-air technology with advanced, fuel-efficient propulsion, AT\u00b2 Aerospace is showing us a whole new way to think about sustainable transport.

      "The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) on Wednesday afternoon announced that Hill, 57, has been charged with obstructing justice and misconduct in Colleton County and perjury in Richland County. The perjury charge stems from a lie she allegedly told South Carolina Supreme Court Justice Toal in January 2024, when the justice ruled that a new trial was not necessary for Murdaugh upon his appeal.",
      "Charging documents state that when Toal asked Hill, \"Did you allow anyone from the press to view sealed exhibits?\" Hill responded, \"No, ma'am,\" which is apparently inconsistent with evidence obtained by authorities.

Nothing in [Hill's charges] about jury tampering,\" he said. \"To my mind, it's a really big win for the state and a big loss for the defense because a main ground of their appeal would be this jury tampering, and the fact that there are no charges against former clerk Hill for jury tampering tells me that the authorities looked at that and did not believe there was sufficient evidence to show that she tampered with the jury.\"",

[Those are] actions that she took outside of that trial in the course and scope of her duties, taking advantage of her office \u2014 obstruction activity. That has nothing to do with it,\" Bland explained. \"One charge in Richland County is a perjury charge.

      "\"At the end of the day, this is going to be a legal decision on appeal,\" Bland said. \"Was Justice Toal correct in applying the South Carolina standard on juror interference by an official? And that, as the South Carolina standard says, you not only have to show the juror interference, but you have to show the effect that it had on the jurors and their verdict. I represented six of those jurors. Eleven of those jurors said\u2026 anything that Becky Hill said didn't have any effect on our verdict.\"",

She's in charge of the clerk of court's office, where all the filings for the case go, and marshaling all the evidence. She's in charge of the jurors and making sure that they get there on time and they're comfortable and they have something to eat.

And again, I don't think there was a malicious intent with that whatsoever.

      "Fletcher, who heads the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), also described how Gazans are struggling due to a lack of supplies, as aid trucks have not been allowed to enter the Gaza Strip for 10 weeks. Hospitals are \"overwhelmed,\" and people are facing famine and starvation, according to Fletcher.",
      "\"So, for those killed and those whose voices are silenced: what more evidence do you need now?

The next day, May 14, a pregnant Israeli woman was killed in a shooting attack while on her way to the hospital to give birth.

      "In his response, Danon said Fletcher\u2019s remarks \"shocked and disturbed\" him, accusing the U.N. official of making an \"utterly inappropriate and deeply irresponsible\" statement that \"shattered any notion of neutrality.\"",
      "\"You had the audacity, in your capacity as a senior U.N. official, to stand before the Security Council and invoke the charge of genocide without evidence, mandate, or restraint,\" Danon wrote in his response. \"As a senior representative of the United Nations, you are obligated to refrain from prejudging complex international matters. Yet, this is precisely what you did before the Council. You did not brief the Council; you delivered a political sermon.\"",
      "In response to a Fox News Digital request for comment, OCHA spokesperson Eri Kaneko said that \"As Mr. Fletcher made clear in his Security Council remarks, it is for legal bodies to consider whether a genocide is taking place - Mr. Fletcher's point is that the world must take decisive action to prevent genocide and ensure respect for international humanitarian law.\"",

      "Danon questioned under whose authority Fletcher issued the accusation and said the U.N. official\u2019s use of the word \"genocide\" was a \"desecration and subversion of a term with unique force and weight.\" He went on to say that what made Fletcher\u2019s remarks \"far worse\" was the fact that Israel had \"engaged with you and your office in good faith at the highest levels.\"",
      "The Israeli ambassador concluded his letter by turning the questions around on Fletcher, telling the OCHA chief to ask himself whether he had done enough to prevent Oct. 7, accelerate the release of the hostages and hold Hamas accountable.",
      "Kaneko told Fox News Digital that \"Mr. Fletcher has repeatedly and publicly spoken out against what he calls the horrendous Hamas-led attacks and called for the release of the hostages. Mr. Fletcher was deeply moved by his visit in February to the kibbutz of Nir Oz, where one in four people were killed or taken hostage.\"",
      "Later on Friday, Fletcher issued his own letter in response to Danon in which he recalled meeting with Oct. 7 survivors from kibbutz Nir Oz, where the Bibas family was taken. He also demanded that the Israeli government \"let us do our work.\"",
      "Fletcher also said that while he was not in his position when the Hamas massacre took place, he watched the \"atrocities\" unfold \"with horror.\" The U.N. official added that he has repeatedly called on Hamas to release hostages unconditionally, including during the session in which he accused Israel of committing genocide.",

      "Here is everything you need to know about Pimlico Race Course, its history, why it\u2019s being demolished, the plans for renovation and much more.",
      "Where is Pimlico Race Course located?",
      "Located in Baltimore, Maryland, Pimlico Race Course has traditionally hosted the \u201cmiddle jewel\u201d of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes.",
      "Pimlico, nicknamed \u201cOld Hilltop,\u201d officially opened its doors on October 25, 1870 and first hosted the Preakness Stakes in 1873. In 1890, the Stakes moved from Maryland to a track in New York. The race didn\u2019t run from 1891 to 1893, and then moved to a different track in New York until 1908. In 1909, the race returned to Pimlico and has been hosted at the iconic venue ever since. Pimlico is the second oldest racetrack in the country, behind Saratoga, which debuted in upstate New York in 1864.",
      "Though the track was renovated in the 1950s, the age of Baltimore\u2019s Historic Pimlico Race Course has been a concern for decades. Back in 2019, nearly 7,000 grandstand seats were closed over safety concerns. Renovation plans were discussed but never carried out.",
      "The demolition of the renowned Pimlico Race Course marks the end of an era, but the revitalization of the structure marks the beginning of a\u00a0new\u00a0era.",
      "What is happening with Pimlico race track?",
      "On May 7, the state of Maryland released design concepts for a new Pimlico Race Course, which is set to debut in 2027. Demolition is expected to begin in June ahead of a $400 million reconstruction funded by state bonds.",
      "The 2026 Preakness Stakes will relocate to Laurel Park, a track that sits about 20 miles south of Pimlico. The 2027 Preakness Stakes are expected to return to Baltimore\u2019s revitalized facility. Then, once Pimlico is back up and running, Laurel Park will close for its own redevelopment.",
      "As part of the multi-year project, and in addition to the new and improved Pimlico, a new hotel, event space, and state-of-the-art Thoroughbred training center will be built at Shamrock Farm in Woodbine, Maryland, which is located approximately 20 miles west of Pimlico. The site design features a strong new identity with inspiration from popular Baltimore landmarks like the Rawlings Conservatory in Druid Hill Park and the original Pimlico Clubhouse. The state will direct at least $110 million to the new training facility, which will offer 328 pastoral acres to more than 800 boarded horses, housing for backstretch workers and a training track with dimensions identical to Pimlico.The Maryland Stadium Authority, in partnership with The Maryland Jockey Club and the Park Heights community, will oversee the construction of the new race course, as well as the additional amenities.",
      "The decision to revitalize Pimlico is an essential step forward to promoting the future of Thoroughbred racing in Maryland, as well as growing local and statewide economies. The new facility will support approximately 500 jobs and over 100 racing days annually. Pimlico currently hosts around 15 racing days per year.",
      "\u201cToday we take another step toward a new, reimagined Pimlico,\u201d said Maryland Governor Wes Moore (Citybiz, May 12, 2025). \u201cTogether, we will continue to drive economic growth in Park Heights, throughout Baltimore, and across the entire state.\u201d",
      "Who owns Pimlico Race Course?",
      "In April, it was announced that the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority, which was created in 2023 to assist in managing Pimlico\u2019s transition from private to public ownership, will be dissolved as soon as July 2025. The Maryland Jockey Club will operate under the Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO).",
      "\u201cWe are excited to deliver a new, modern Pimlico for racing fans and the Park Heights community,\u201d said Maryland Stadium Authority Chairman Craig Thompson. \u201cThis work is bigger than a racetrack, as historic and important as it is. This is about bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in state investment to Park Heights and working in partnership with MEDCO and the local community to realize a shared vision for the future.\u201d",
      "Despite 1/ST (formerly known as The Stronach Group) transferring operations of Pimlico to the state of Maryland on January 1, 2025, the company is still spearheading the Preakness this year and next year. For 2027 and beyond, Maryland will adopt control over the Stakes. The state will essentially license the event name from 1/ST as part of a long-term agreement.",
      "\u201cIt was highly unlikely that a private operator would want to come in because \u2018What\u2019s the upside for a private operator?\u2019 They\u2019re in the business of making a profit,\u201d said the Thoroughbred Horsemen\u2019s Association chairman and CEO Alan Foreman (Blood Horse, March 2024). \u201c[The tracks] don\u2019t have gaming in Maryland \u2014 they get a small piece of gaming revenue for capital improvement purposes. And there\u2019s really no upside for an operator other than they covet the Preakness.\u201d",
      "Who holds the track record at Pimlico?",
      "It\u2019s important to note that there are other races held at Pimlico besides the Preakness Stakes. With that being said, the owner of the track record at Pimlico for 1 3/16 mile distance is\u00a0Farma Way, with a time of 1:52 2/5 in the 1991 Pimlico Special.",
      "Who holds the track record at the Preakness?",
      "In 1973,\u00a0Secretariat\u00a0secured the Preakness record at 1 3/16 miles, with a time of 1:53 2/5.",
      "Note:\u00a0The Preakness has been staged at seven different distances since its debut in 1873. From 1925 to present day, the distance run is set at 1 3/16 miles.",

      "Here is everything you need to know about Pimlico Race Course, its history, why it\u2019s being demolished, the plans for renovation and much more.",
      "Where is Pimlico Race Course located?",
      "Located in Baltimore, Maryland, Pimlico Race Course has traditionally hosted the \u201cmiddle jewel\u201d of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes.",
      "Pimlico, nicknamed \u201cOld Hilltop,\u201d officially opened its doors on October 25, 1870 and first hosted the Preakness Stakes in 1873. In 1890, the Stakes moved from Maryland to a track in New York. The race didn\u2019t run from 1891 to 1893, and then moved to a different track in New York until 1908. In 1909, the race returned to Pimlico and has been hosted at the iconic venue ever since. Pimlico is the second oldest racetrack in the country, behind Saratoga, which debuted in upstate New York in 1864.",
      "Though the track was renovated in the 1950s, the age of Baltimore\u2019s Historic Pimlico Race Course has been a concern for decades. Back in 2019, nearly 7,000 grandstand seats were closed over safety concerns. Renovation plans were discussed but never carried out.",
      "The demolition of the renowned Pimlico Race Course marks the end of an era, but the revitalization of the structure marks the beginning of a\u00a0new\u00a0era.",
      "What is happening with Pimlico race track?",
      "On May 7, the state of Maryland released design concepts for a new Pimlico Race Course, which is set to debut in 2027. Demolition is expected to begin in June ahead of a $400 million reconstruction funded by state bonds.",
      "The 2026 Preakness Stakes will relocate to Laurel Park, a track that sits about 20 miles south of Pimlico. The 2027 Preakness Stakes are expected to return to Baltimore\u2019s revitalized facility. Then, once Pimlico is back up and running, Laurel Park will close for its own redevelopment.",
      "As part of the multi-year project, and in addition to the new and improved Pimlico, a new hotel, event space, and state-of-the-art Thoroughbred training center will be built at Shamrock Farm in Woodbine, Maryland, which is located approximately 20 miles west of Pimlico. The site design features a strong new identity with inspiration from popular Baltimore landmarks like the Rawlings Conservatory in Druid Hill Park and the original Pimlico Clubhouse. The state will direct at least $110 million to the new training facility, which will offer 328 pastoral acres to more than 800 boarded horses, housing for backstretch workers and a training track with dimensions identical to Pimlico.The Maryland Stadium Authority, in partnership with The Maryland Jockey Club and the Park Heights community, will oversee the construction of the new race course, as well as the additional amenities.",
      "The decision to revitalize Pimlico is an essential step forward to promoting the future of Thoroughbred racing in Maryland, as well as growing local and statewide economies. The new facility will support approximately 500 jobs and over 100 racing days annually. Pimlico currently hosts around 15 racing days per year.",
      "\u201cToday we take another step toward a new, reimagined Pimlico,\u201d said Maryland Governor Wes Moore (Citybiz, May 12, 2025). \u201cTogether, we will continue to drive economic growth in Park Heights, throughout Baltimore, and across the entire state.\u201d",
      "Who owns Pimlico Race Course?",
      "In April, it was announced that the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority, which was created in 2023 to assist in managing Pimlico\u2019s transition from private to public ownership, will be dissolved as soon as July 2025. The Maryland Jockey Club will operate under the Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO).",
      "\u201cWe are excited to deliver a new, modern Pimlico for racing fans and the Park Heights community,\u201d said Maryland Stadium Authority Chairman Craig Thompson. \u201cThis work is bigger than a racetrack, as historic and important as it is. This is about bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in state investment to Park Heights and working in partnership with MEDCO and the local community to realize a shared vision for the future.\u201d",
      "Despite 1/ST (formerly known as The Stronach Group) transferring operations of Pimlico to the state of Maryland on January 1, 2025, the company is still spearheading the Preakness this year and next year. For 2027 and beyond, Maryland will adopt control over the Stakes. The state will essentially license the event name from 1/ST as part of a long-term agreement.",
      "\u201cIt was highly unlikely that a private operator would want to come in because \u2018What\u2019s the upside for a private operator?\u2019 They\u2019re in the business of making a profit,\u201d said the Thoroughbred Horsemen\u2019s Association chairman and CEO Alan Foreman (Blood Horse, March 2024). \u201c[The tracks] don\u2019t have gaming in Maryland \u2014 they get a small piece of gaming revenue for capital improvement purposes. And there\u2019s really no upside for an operator other than they covet the Preakness.\u201d",
      "Who holds the track record at Pimlico?",
      "It\u2019s important to note that there are other races held at Pimlico besides the Preakness Stakes. With that being said, the owner of the track record at Pimlico for 1 3/16 mile distance is\u00a0Farma Way, with a time of 1:52 2/5 in the 1991 Pimlico Special.",
      "Who holds the track record at the Preakness?",
      "In 1973,\u00a0Secretariat\u00a0secured the Preakness record at 1 3/16 miles, with a time of 1:53 2/5.",
      "Note:\u00a0The Preakness has been staged at seven different distances since its debut in 1873. From 1925 to present day, the distance run is set at 1 3/16 miles.",

      "President Donald Trump on Saturday said that he'll speak separately to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday as he ramps up efforts to help the two nations reach a ceasefire.",
      "\"I will be speaking, by telephone, to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Monday, at 10:00 a.m.,\" Trump wrote in an all-caps post on Truth Social on Saturday, adding, \"I will then be speaking to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.\"",
      "Trump said he would speak to Putin about \"stopping the 'bloodbath' that is killing, on average, more than 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, and trade.\"",
      "\u201cHopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump has urged Zelenskyy and Putin for months to reach a ceasefire deal to end the three-year war. Ending the war was a key campaign promise of Trump's during the 2024 presidential election cycle.",
      "Officials from Russia and Ukraine met in Istanbul on Friday to hold their first direct talks since the war began. The two sides reached an agreement for a prisoner swap but did not appear to be significantly closer to setting terms for a permanent ceasefire.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday about peace talks, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.",
      "Putin did not attend the Istanbul talks. Trump told reporters on Friday that he and the Russian president \"have to meet.\"",
      "\"He and I will meet. I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not,\" Trump added.",
      "The president has for weeks escalated rhetoric against Putin, blasting him for striking Ukraine as U.S. officials tried to initiate talks between both sides.",

      "Trump met with Zelenskyy for a private conversation on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral in Rome in April. After that meeting, the U.S. president questioned Putin's commitment to ending the war in Ukraine, writing in another Truth Social post that recent Russian strikes, \"[make] me think that maybe he doesn\u2019t want to stop the war, he\u2019s just tapping me along.\"",
      "Earlier in his administration, Trump and top U.S. officials, like Vice President JD Vance, targeted their ire about the ongoing war toward Zelenskyy, with a late-February White House meeting between the three men devolving into a shouting match.",
      "Last month, Ukraine and the U.S. reached a deal on an \"economic partnership\" between the two nations involving Ukraine's rare earth minerals.",

    "story": [
      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday\u2019s grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest, the world\u2019s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israel and Switzerland to come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour.",
      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",
      "Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results.",
      "Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year\u2019s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points.",
      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Raphael\u2019s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points.",
      "There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public.",
      "Sweden\u2019s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ\u2019s \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act\u2019s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels \u2014 a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday.",
      "The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties.",
      "Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956 as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries. This year, there were 37 nations taking part, whittled down to 26 finalists over two semifinals earlier this week. And the production is now a behemoth, with hundreds of crew members and 22 cameras capturing the action.",
      "The first act to perform was Kyle Alessandro, a 19-year-old from Norway, who took the stage wearing chain mail for a pyrotechnic-enhanced rendition of his entry, \u201cLighter.\u201d",
      "His song kicked off a show that included a number of memorable performances, including that of Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman, whose sexually charged \u201cIch Komme\u201d ends with her suspended in the air atop a giant microphone stand emitting sparks.",
      "Poland\u2019s Justyna Steczkowska made her return to Eurovision after 30 years with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-inspired performance that saw the 52-year-old lifted into the air by ropes as a CGI dragon swooped behind her on an 8,000-square-foot LED video wall.",
      "Some 163 million people watched the Eurovision final and the two semifinals last year. Final viewing figures are not yet available for this year\u2019s competition, but it is sure to remain one of the most-watched events in the world. It attracts more viewers than the Super Bowl, which had 123.4 million viewers last year, according to CBS.",
      "That viewership will likely see \"Wasted Love\" climb the charts across Europe. For some Eurovision winners like Dion and ABBA, international stardom awaits.",
      "Most artists aren\u2019t quite that lucky, but the massive platform means winners can see levels of fame they would otherwise only dream of.",
      "Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after winning the 2021 contest, and Dutch singer Duncan Laurence performed his winning 2019 song \u201cArcade\u201d on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show when it started climbing U.S. charts after going viral on TikTok.",

    "story": [
      "For more than five years, Abdul Rahman Waziri put his life on the line to protect U.S. Green Berets. He was a member of an elite unit of Afghans trained to detect hidden explosives \u2014\u00a0considered the tip of the tip of the spear in America\u2019s bloody fight against the Taliban.",
      "Waziri was also one of the lucky ones. Unlike many other Afghans who worked for the U.S. military, he made it out of the country during America\u2019s chaotic withdrawal in 2021. He settled in Houston with his wife, where they were raising their two young girls.",
      "But on April 27, Waziri, 31, was fatally shot outside his apartment complex in a dispute about parking. The shock and heartbreak felt by his family has been compounded by what they consider to be a baffling decision by law enforcement to release the gunman with no charges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Waziri\u2019s brother, Abdullah Khan. \u201cIn Afghanistan, we have no law at all. But if someone gets murdered, the person will not be free.\u201d",
      "Houston police said in a statement that following the shooting, officers at the scene were approached by a man who identified himself as the shooter and said he and Waziri were \u201carguing over parking.\u201d Officers interviewed the man and took possession of his gun but then let him go.",
      "\u201cAfter consulting with the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office, the male was released and [Houston Police Department] investigators will continue their investigation,\u201d the police added. They have not released his name.",
      "Three weeks later, no action has been taken. The authorities have not made any other public statements despite mounting pressure from the area\u2019s growing Afghan community as well as Green Berets who worked with Waziri.",
      "\u201cHe was a lion of a man but also one of the most gentle warriors I have ever seen,\u201d said Ben Hoffman, a former Green Beret who went on missions with Waziri in 2019.",
      "\u201cThis guy risked his life for us,\u201d Hoffman added. \u201cAnd for him to survive all of that and make it out of Afghanistan and then just die in cold blood outside an apartment complex in Houston \u2014 what is going on here?\u201d",
      "Damali Keith, a spokeswoman for the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office, said: \u201cWe are still awaiting additional information from investigators before making a charging decision.\u201d",
      "The Houston Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What surveillance video shows",
      "The shooting took place just before 9:10 p.m. at the Gables at Richmond Apartments, where Waziri had been living since last year.",
      "A surveillance camera captured Waziri driving into the parking area in a white Toyota Camry. He pulled the car to a stop and put on his blinkers. According to his brother, he was coming home from the gym. Waziri was likely going to grab his mail and then park in a spot closer to his apartment, his brother said.",
      "But about 30 seconds after Waziri\u2019s car pulled in, a black Kia sedan turned into the parking lot. It came to a stop directly behind Waziri\u2019s vehicle, according to the surveillance footage, which was provided by the family's attorney.",
      "What happened next is not entirely clear. The area where the cars were stopped can\u2019t be seen on the video because of a structure looming over the parking lot.",
      "But Waziri can be seen walking away from his car, with the other man trailing behind him. They stop and exchange words while pointing in the direction of their vehicles. Then Waziri continues walking away and the other man returns to where their cars were parked.",
      "Seconds later, Waziri looks back in that direction and then walks back toward his car. It\u2019s unclear what happens over the next 55 seconds. But near the end, the other man\u2019s shoes can be seen moving in the direction of his car and then back toward Waziri\u2019s.",
      "Shortly afterward, the other man was captured on the video walking away from the scene.",
      "\u201cIt shocks me that this man was not arrested,\u201d said the Waziri family attorney, Omar Khawaja.",
      "Khawaja said he spoke to a witness and escorted that person to police headquarters five days after the shooting. The witness provided the following account to investigators, according to Khawaja.",
      "After the initial confrontation captured on video, the other man began to kick Waziri\u2019s car. That\u2019s what prompted Waziri to walk back to the vehicles. A physical struggle ensued, with Waziri getting the upper hand, and then the other man returned to his car and retrieved a gun.",
      "Waziri put his hands up and said something along the lines of, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d but the gunman opened fire anyway.",
      "NBC News\u2019 efforts to reach the witness were not successful.",
      "Police said Waziri was shot \u201cmore than one time,\u201d and officers discovered his body lying next to his white Toyota. Khawaja, the family\u2019s attorney, said Waziri was unarmed at the time; he owned a gun but it was at home.",
      "Khawaja said he is aware of at least one other witness who is too afraid to come forward.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the kind of paralysis and fear the community feels,\u201d Khawaja said. \u201cThe guy who just killed this man is still living in the community and with no consequences whatsoever. That\u2019s a chilling effect on witnesses.\u201d",
      "What the law says",
      "Under Texas law, a person has a right to use deadly force if it is believed to be \u201cimmediately necessary\u201d to protect against another\u2019s \u201cuse or attempted use of unlawful force.\u201d",
      "David Crump, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said another factor looms large in a prosecutor\u2019s decision on whether to bring charges: Did the person initiate the altercation?",
      "\u201cIf someone initiates a quarrel and ends up shooting a guy who was unarmed, it seems strange to me that the shooter was not arrested,\u201d Crump said. \u201cBut I have to add that we don\u2019t know all the facts.\u201d",
      "The killing has sparked protests in Houston, where thousands of Afghans have settled after fleeing their homeland. It also prompted some of Waziri\u2019s Green Beret friends to write letters to Houston Mayor John Whitmore demanding justice.",
      "One of those retired Green Berets, Vince Leyva, said in an interview that he used to call Waziri a \u201cgentle giant.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 6-foot-1 and he towered over me,\u201d said Leyva. \u201cBut he was so calm, so well-spoken. He was not a guy who would argue, which is why this really baffles me.\u201d",
      "Waziri and the other Afghan members of the National Mine Reduction Group, or NMRG, would be out in front of U.S. Special Forces members during missions. Their job was to identify and disable improvised explosive devices, but they sometimes found themselves in firefights during Taliban ambushes.",
      "Beyond the risk of getting killed on the job, they were frequently hunted down by insurgents.",
      "\u201cEveryone knew who the NMRG were, especially the Taliban,\u201d said Leyva, who helped train the Afghans. \u201cThey always had targets on their backs, but they were proud to do their job.\u201d",
      "Waziri was so good at it that he was selected to be an instructor, Leyva said, a role he had until U.S. forces withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021.",
      "Waziri was looking out for others even in his last few days in his homeland as the Taliban swiftly seized major cities, according to Shireen Connor, who was part of a grassroots team of veterans and others who helped to coordinate the evacuations of Afghans.",
      "\u201cThe streets of Kabul were engulfed in panic,\u201d Connor said in a letter to the Houston mayor.",
      "\u201cIn the midst of this, Mr. Waziri, a high-profile Taliban target, was setting up safe houses not for himself but for our evacuees. Always helping other people in the face of significant personal peril. How do you define a human being like this?\u201d",
      "After the shooting, Waziri\u2019s wife and two young daughters \u2014 4-year-old Bahar and her 9-month-old baby sister, Zoya \u2014 flew to Florida to stay with his brother.",
      "\u201cHis wife is in very bad condition now,\u201d said Khan, the brother. \u201cShe\u2019s still panicking.\u201d",
      "Khan and Waziri\u2019s wife have yet to tell Bahar that her father is dead. And so, nearly every day, the little girl asks her mother and uncle a string of heartbreaking questions.",
      "Where is my father? When is he coming home? Please, can you just call him?"

    "story": [
      "Before sunrise in Baltimore on Friday,\u00a0the Rev.\u00a0Robert Turner, senior pastor of the Empowerment\u00a0Temple AME Church, set out to walk 43 miles from his church to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.",
      "Turner, who has made the trip from Baltimore to D.C. more than 30 times to call for reparations for Black people across America because of the consequences of slavery, made the 14-hour journey this week to protest what he says is an attempt by the Trump administration to erase important American history. For him, the future of the\u00a0museum that he and many other Black people lovingly call the \u201cBlacksonian\u201d is worth every step.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t know the horrors that we went through, the hell, then you might not see the need for repairing,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for President Trump to know this issue of saving the Blacksonian and the issue of repairing America, and creating a culture of repair is very important to saving the soul of America.\u201d",
      "The context: Decades-old artifacts related to slavery and civil rights are rotating out of exhibits at the museum as a\u00a0potential White House review\u00a0looms.",
      "In late March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding in part that the museum take down any exhibits that \u201cdivide Americans based on race.\u201d\u00a0But now, the White House says it is\u00a0not involved\u00a0in\u00a0any\u00a0changes at the museum,\u00a0while\u00a0Democrats in Congress are sounding the alarm, signing\u00a0a letter and\u00a0introducing legislation to protect civil rights landmarks.",
      "NBC News went inside the museum and found at least 32 artifacts\u00a0that were once on display\u00a0have been removed.",
      "They include Harriet Tubman\u2019s book of hymns filled with gospels that she is believed to have sung as she led enslaved people to freedom through the underground railroad,\u00a0as well as a cloth made by enslaved people and a photo of the hip-hop group Public Enemy.",
      "Also removed was the \u201cNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,\u201d the memoir by one of the most important leaders in the abolition movement. Both items were gifted to the\u00a0Smithsonian.",
      "In a statement, White House spokesperson Lindsey Halligan said, \u201cThe White House had no involvement in removing any exhibit from the National Museum of African American History and Culture or any other Smithsonian institution. They did this on their own accord.\u201d",
      "The\u00a0museum\u00a0pushed back on criticism, saying on\u00a0its\u00a0website\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cclaims that objects have been removed for reasons other than adherence to standard loan agreements or museum practices are false.\u201d\u00a0It also\u00a0listed\u00a011 new artifacts coming on display later this month,\u00a0including a photograph focused on how mass incarceration impacts Black people, a painting depicting a Ku Klux Klan figure, and artwork dedicated to Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy from Chicago murdered by white men in 1955 while visiting family in Mississippi after the teen was accused of trying to flirt with a white woman.",
      "In an email to NBC News, the museum reiterated that rotating objects is normal.",
      "But Turner isn\u2019t convinced.\u00a0\u201cWe have to now say enough is enough, and America is better than this, Black and white,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are stronger than this. If our children can endure being\u00a0lynched, then white children can endure a classroom that teaches that America used to lynch kids.\u201d",
      "Liz Brazelton,\u00a0the owner of a diary connected to the Oscar-winning film \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d isn\u2019t convinced either. She\u2019s the great-great-granddaughter of the lawyer who helped free Solomon Northup, a free Black man who was kidnapped and forced into slavery.",
      "\u201cI grew up with the diaries,\u201d Brazelton said. \u201cThe most important thing in his diaries was the fact that he did help free this man who was a free man of color. And it\u2019s just an amazing story. And in central Louisiana, it\u2019s quite a prominent story. And I\u2019m very proud of it.\u201d",
      "She gave one of\u00a0her great-great-grandfather\u2019s diaries to the museum in September 2015 on a 10-year loan. The museum sent her a letter in March, before the end of the term, saying, \u201cWe have decided to move ahead with the return a bit early to coincide with our internal gallery rotation schedule.\u201d",
      "The letter was sent two weeks before Trump signed the executive order targeting\u00a0exhibits at\u00a0the Smithsonian,\u00a0which\u00a0raised\u00a0a red flag for Brazelton.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw the executive order, I wondered if they maybe knew something was going to happen and they rotated it out early because it was about slavery, that entire exhibit,\u201d she said.",
      "The Smithsonian declined NBC News\u2019 request for an interview.\u00a0But it repeated in an email that the diary move was a scheduled rotation to \u201callow for necessary rest following an extended display period.\u201d",
      "Brazelton said she was never told between 2016 and 2025 that her family\u2019s\u00a0diary\u00a0was ever taken off of exhibit or rotated out. She believes it had stayed in the exhibit until recently.",
      "The Rev.\u00a0Amos C. Brown, a prominent pastor and civil rights leader, lent two of his books to the\u00a0museum\u00a0when it opened in 2016.\u00a0The items included his father\u2019s\u00a0Bible,\u00a0which is\u00a0more than 100 years old and\u00a0was carried by\u00a0Brown during protests with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,\u00a0as well as a book on the history of Black people that was written in the 1800s.",
      "\u201cI was feeling that through this museum, America will see me, will see Black people,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe have been and are architects, designers of great things. \u2026 We took a negative and turned it into a positive, and telling the story of how people achieved great things in spite of oppression, in spite of those evil things that were done to us, that\u2019s what that museum represents.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, the\u00a0Smithsonian sent him an email saying\u00a0it\u00a0would return his books.\u00a0The museum called it a \u201cstandard practice,\u201d adding that the loan expired in May.\u00a0Still, Brown called that explanation an excuse,\u00a0noting to\u00a0NBC News that the museum has always chosen to renew the loan until now.",
      "\u201cI feel it to be very much inhumane, disrespectful and downright unjust,\u201d he said of the decision to end the loan.",
      "After his public pushback, the museum offered to keep the books permanently, according to a letter reviewed by NBC News.",
      "The broader controversy is becoming increasingly political. House Democrats are demanding Vice President JD Vance, who now sits on the board of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, not\u00a0take steps\u00a0to overhaul\u00a0the museum. In a letter, the lawmakers said, \u201cThis flagrant attempt to erase Black history is unacceptable and must be stopped.\u201d",
      "Rep. Terri Sewell, an Alabama\u00a0Democrat\u00a0who\u00a0sits on\u00a0a\u00a0House committee that conducts\u00a0oversight\u00a0of\u00a0the Smithsonian Institution, was\u00a0among\u00a0the lawmakers who signed\u00a0the letter. \u201cTo tell the truth means to share the good and the bad. And if we don\u2019t tell our stories, who will tell our stories?\u201d\u00a0she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Turner plans to continue making his monthly, hourslong pilgrimage from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., to shine a brighter spotlight on the museum\u2019s artifacts getting pulled from displays\u00a0and to demand reparations for Black people across the nation.",
      "\u201cOur story cannot die, no matter who\u2019s in the White House,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Two weeks after entering the Kentucky Derby as the favorite only to finish second, Journalism appeared beaten again entering the final straightaway at Saturday\u2019s Preakness Stakes, the middle leg of horse racing\u2019s Triple Crown.",
      "Once trailing by as many as five lengths, Journalism was still far behind Gosger at the top of the homestretch as it squeezed between Clever Again and Goal Oriented \u2014 the horses so close they and their jockeys rubbed together \u2014 before finally finding open ground. From there, with jockey Umberto Rispoli urging him on, Journalism ran down Gosger at the post, needing all of the course\u2019s 1 3/16th miles to author a stunning comeback victory at the 150th Preakness at Baltimore\u2019s Pimlico Race Course.",
      "It was the second Preakness victory for Journalism's trainer, Michael W. McCarthy, who previously won in 2021 with Rombauer. As the gap between the leader and Journalism widened, McCarthy said he was resigned to a loss.",
      "\u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018Proud of the horse,\u2019\u201d McCarthy said. \u201c\u2018Great effort, just gonna come up a little bit short.\u2019\u201d",
      "Except, the race was far from over. Gosger finished second, with Sandman third.",
      "\u201cThe horse is a champion,\u201d Aron Wellman, a co-owner of Journalism, said on NBC in the winner\u2019s circle. \u201cOur jockey Umberto Rispoli is a champion. Our trainer Michael McCarthy is a champion.\u201d",
      "Rispoli became the first jockey from Italy to win a Triple Crown race.",
      "\u201cI wish everybody over there are proud of me,\u201d Rispoli said.",
      "Journalism outlasted eight other competitors, a small field that did not include Derby winner Sovereignty, after trainer Bill Mott withdrew the horse due to the short turnaround between races. It marked the third time in the last four years that the Derby winner skipped the Preakness. The Triple Crown, Mott said earlier this month, is \u201cnot something we\u2019re not going to think about.\u201d",
      "It was the fifth time in the last seven years that the Preakness started without a true shot at the Triple Crown, a trend that has sparked a debate about whether the two-week turnaround between Triple Crown races has become antiquated.",
      "The field of nine horses was still anticipated as the trainers \u2014 including Bob Baffert and his record eight Preakness victories, and D. Wayne Lukas, who has won seven times at Pimlico over 44 years \u2014 had amassed a combined 19 previous Preakness victories.",
      "Journalism was still considered the favorite following the Derby and opened with 8-5 odds Saturday morning. By race time, it had become an even bigger favorite at 6-5. Yet its path to victory was made difficult only a quarter of a mile in Saturday, as Clever Again led entering the first turn, followed closely by Gosger and River Thames, with Journalism sixth. Both Rispoli, the jockey, and McCarthy, the trainer, said in post-race interviews they believed their horse was in trouble and might run hard, only to come in second, as at the Derby.",
      "Yet Journalism was in first at the end, right on deadline."

    "story": [
      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday\u2019s grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest, the world\u2019s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israel and Switzerland to come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour.",
      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",
      "Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results.",
      "Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year\u2019s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points.",
      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Raphael\u2019s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points.",
      "There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public.",
      "Sweden\u2019s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ\u2019s \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act\u2019s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels \u2014 a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday.",
      "The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties.",
      "Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956 as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries. This year, there were 37 nations taking part, whittled down to 26 finalists over two semifinals earlier this week. And the production is now a behemoth, with hundreds of crew members and 22 cameras capturing the action.",
      "The first act to perform was Kyle Alessandro, a 19-year-old from Norway, who took the stage wearing chain mail for a pyrotechnic-enhanced rendition of his entry, \u201cLighter.\u201d",
      "His song kicked off a show that included a number of memorable performances, including that of Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman, whose sexually charged \u201cIch Komme\u201d ends with her suspended in the air atop a giant microphone stand emitting sparks.",
      "Poland\u2019s Justyna Steczkowska made her return to Eurovision after 30 years with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-inspired performance that saw the 52-year-old lifted into the air by ropes as a CGI dragon swooped behind her on an 8,000-square-foot LED video wall.",
      "Some 163 million people watched the Eurovision final and the two semifinals last year. Final viewing figures are not yet available for this year\u2019s competition, but it is sure to remain one of the most-watched events in the world. It attracts more viewers than the Super Bowl, which had 123.4 million viewers last year, according to CBS.",
      "That viewership will likely see \"Wasted Love\" climb the charts across Europe. For some Eurovision winners like Dion and ABBA, international stardom awaits.",
      "Most artists aren\u2019t quite that lucky, but the massive platform means winners can see levels of fame they would otherwise only dream of.",
      "Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after winning the 2021 contest, and Dutch singer Duncan Laurence performed his winning 2019 song \u201cArcade\u201d on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show when it started climbing U.S. charts after going viral on TikTok.",
      "For the 25 artists who didn\u2019t win, there\u2019s still the hope that they\u2019ll have found new fans.",
      "Holly-Anne Hull, a member of this year\u2019s British act, Remember Monday, told NBC News in a Zoom interview last month that for her group, the outcome is secondary to the opportunity to be able to perform together on the world stage.",

      "They include Harriet Tubman\u2019s book of hymns filled with gospels that she is believed to have sung as she led enslaved people to freedom through the underground railroad,\u00a0as well as a cloth made by enslaved people and a photo of the hip-hop group Public Enemy.",
      "Also removed was the \u201cNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,\u201d the memoir by one of the most important leaders in the abolition movement. Both items were gifted to the\u00a0Smithsonian.",
      "In a statement, White House spokesperson Lindsey Halligan said, \u201cThe White House had no involvement in removing any exhibit from the National Museum of African American History and Culture or any other Smithsonian institution. They did this on their own accord.\u201d",
      "The\u00a0museum\u00a0pushed back on criticism, saying on\u00a0its\u00a0website\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cclaims that objects have been removed for reasons other than adherence to standard loan agreements or museum practices are false.\u201d\u00a0It also\u00a0listed\u00a011 new artifacts coming on display later this month,\u00a0including a photograph focused on how mass incarceration impacts Black people, a painting depicting a Ku Klux Klan figure, and artwork dedicated to Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy from Chicago murdered by white men in 1955 while visiting family in Mississippi after the teen was accused of trying to flirt with a white woman.",
      "In an email to NBC News, the museum reiterated that rotating objects is normal.",
      "But Turner isn\u2019t convinced.\u00a0\u201cWe have to now say enough is enough, and America is better than this, Black and white,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are stronger than this. If our children can endure being\u00a0lynched, then white children can endure a classroom that teaches that America used to lynch kids.\u201d",
      "Liz Brazelton,\u00a0the owner of a diary connected to the Oscar-winning film \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d isn\u2019t convinced either. She\u2019s the great-great-granddaughter of the lawyer who helped free Solomon Northup, a free Black man who was kidnapped and forced into slavery.",
      "\u201cI grew up with the diaries,\u201d Brazelton said. \u201cThe most important thing in his diaries was the fact that he did help free this man who was a free man of color. And it\u2019s just an amazing story. And in central Louisiana, it\u2019s quite a prominent story. And I\u2019m very proud of it.\u201d",
      "She gave one of\u00a0her great-great-grandfather\u2019s diaries to the museum in September 2015 on a 10-year loan. The museum sent her a letter in March, before the end of the term, saying, \u201cWe have decided to move ahead with the return a bit early to coincide with our internal gallery rotation schedule.\u201d",
      "The letter was sent two weeks before Trump signed the executive order targeting\u00a0exhibits at\u00a0the Smithsonian,\u00a0which\u00a0raised\u00a0a red flag for Brazelton.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw the executive order, I wondered if they maybe knew something was going to happen and they rotated it out early because it was about slavery, that entire exhibit,\u201d she said.",
      "The Smithsonian declined NBC News\u2019 request for an interview.\u00a0But it repeated in an email that the diary move was a scheduled rotation to \u201callow for necessary rest following an extended display period.\u201d",
      "Brazelton said she was never told between 2016 and 2025 that her family\u2019s\u00a0diary\u00a0was ever taken off of exhibit or rotated out. She believes it had stayed in the exhibit until recently.",
      "The Rev.\u00a0Amos C. Brown, a prominent pastor and civil rights leader, lent two of his books to the\u00a0museum\u00a0when it opened in 2016.\u00a0The items included his father\u2019s\u00a0Bible,\u00a0which is\u00a0more than 100 years old and\u00a0was carried by\u00a0Brown during protests with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,\u00a0as well as a book on the history of Black people that was written in the 1800s.",
      "\u201cI was feeling that through this museum, America will see me, will see Black people,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe have been and are architects, designers of great things. \u2026 We took a negative and turned it into a positive, and telling the story of how people achieved great things in spite of oppression, in spite of those evil things that were done to us, that\u2019s what that museum represents.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, the\u00a0Smithsonian sent him an email saying\u00a0it\u00a0would return his books.\u00a0The museum called it a \u201cstandard practice,\u201d adding that the loan expired in May.\u00a0Still, Brown called that explanation an excuse,\u00a0noting to\u00a0NBC News that the museum has always chosen to renew the loan until now.",
      "\u201cI feel it to be very much inhumane, disrespectful and downright unjust,\u201d he said of the decision to end the loan.",
      "After his public pushback, the museum offered to keep the books permanently, according to a letter reviewed by NBC News.",
      "The broader controversy is becoming increasingly political. House Democrats are demanding Vice President JD Vance, who now sits on the board of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, not\u00a0take steps\u00a0to overhaul\u00a0the museum. In a letter, the lawmakers said, \u201cThis flagrant attempt to erase Black history is unacceptable and must be stopped.\u201d",
      "Rep. Terri Sewell, an Alabama\u00a0Democrat\u00a0who\u00a0sits on\u00a0a\u00a0House committee that conducts\u00a0oversight\u00a0of\u00a0the Smithsonian Institution, was\u00a0among\u00a0the lawmakers who signed\u00a0the letter. \u201cTo tell the truth means to share the good and the bad. And if we don\u2019t tell our stories, who will tell our stories?\u201d\u00a0she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Turner plans to continue making his monthly, hourslong pilgrimage from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., to shine a brighter spotlight on the museum\u2019s artifacts getting pulled from displays\u00a0and to demand reparations for Black people across the nation.",
      "\u201cOur story cannot die, no matter who\u2019s in the White House,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Oklahoma high school students studying U.S. history learn about the Industrial Revolution, women\u2019s suffrage and America\u2019s expanding role in international affairs.",
      "Beginning next school year, they will add conspiracy theories about the\u00a02020 presidential election.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s new social studies standards for K-12 public school students, already infused with references to the Bible and national pride, were revised at the direction of state School Superintendent\u00a0Ryan Walters.\u00a0The Republican official has spent much of his first term in office lauding\u00a0President Donald Trump, feuding with teachers unions and local school superintendents, and trying to end what he describes as \u201cwokeness\u201d in public schools.",
      "\u201cThe left has been pushing left-wing indoctrination in the classroom,\u201d Walters said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving it back to actually understanding history ... and I\u2019m unapologetic about that.\u201d",
      "The previous standard for studying the 2020 election merely said, \u201cExamine issues related to the election of 2020 and its outcome.\u201d The new version is more expansive: \u201cIdentify discrepancies in 2020 elections results by looking at graphs and other information, including the sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, the security risks of mail-in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters, and the unprecedented contradiction of \u2018bellwether county\u2019 trends.\u201d",
      "The new standard raised red flags even among Walters\u2019 fellow Republicans, including the governor and legislative leaders. They were concerned that several last-minute changes, including the language about the 2020 election and a provision stating the source of the Covid virus was a Chinese lab, were added just hours before the state school board voted on them.",
      "A group of parents and educators have\u00a0filed a lawsuit\u00a0asking a judge to reject the standards, arguing they were not reviewed properly and that they \u201crepresent a distorted view of social studies that intentionally favors an outdated and blatantly biased perspective.\u201d",
      "GOP lawmakers can\u2019t muster enough support to reject the new standards",
      "While many Oklahoma teachers have expressed outrage at the change in the standards, others say they leave plenty of room for an effective teacher to instruct students about the results of the 2020 election without misinforming them.",
      "Aaron Baker, who has taught U.S. government in high schools in Oklahoma City for more than a decade, said he\u2019s most concerned about teachers in rural, conservative parts of the state who might feel encouraged to impose their own beliefs on students.",
      "\u201cIf someone is welcoming the influence of these far-right organizations in our standards and is interested in inserting more of Christianity into our practices as teachers, then they\u2019ve become emboldened,\u201d Baker said. \u201cFor me, that is the major concern.\u201d",
      "Leaders in the Republican-led Oklahoma Legislature introduced a resolution to reject the standards, but there wasn\u2019t enough GOP support to pass it.",
      "Part of that hesitation likely stemmed from a flurry of last-minute opposition organized by pro-Trump conservative groups such as\u00a0Moms for Liberty, which has a large presence in Oklahoma and threatened lawmakers who reject the standards with a primary opponent.",
      "\u201cIn the last few election cycles, grassroots conservative organizations have flipped seats across Oklahoma by holding weak Republicans accountable,\u201d the group wrote in a letter signed by several other conservative groups and GOP activists. \u201cIf you choose to side with the liberal media and make backroom deals with Democrats to block conservative reform, you will be next.\u201d",
      "Superintendent says his new standards \u2018encourage critical thinking\u2019",
      "After a group of parents, educators and other Oklahoma school officials worked to develop the new social studies standards, Walters assembled an executive committee consisting mostly of out-of-state pundits from conservative think-tanks to revise them. He said he wanted to focus more on American exceptionalism and\u00a0incorporate the Bible\u00a0as an instructional resource.",
      "Among those Walters appointed to the review committee are Kevin Roberts, the president of The Heritage Foundation and a key figure in its Project 2025 blueprint for a conservative administration, and Dennis Prager, a radio talk show host who founded Prager U, a conservative nonprofit that offers \u201cpro-American\u201d educational materials for children that some critics say are not accurate or objective.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, Walters defended teaching students about \u201cunprecedented and historically significant\u201d elements of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\u201cThe standards do not instruct students on what to believe; rather, they encourage critical thinking by inviting students to examine real events, review publicly available information, and come to their own conclusions,\u201d he said.",
      "Recounts,\u00a0reviews\u00a0and\u00a0audits\u00a0in the\u00a0battleground states\u00a0where Trump contested his loss all confirmed\u00a0Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory, and Trump\u00a0lost dozens of court cases\u00a0challenging the results.",
      "Critics say Walters\u2019 new standard is filled with misleading phrasing that seeks to steer the discussion in particular direction.",
      "Democrats characterized it as another political ploy by Walters, widely viewed as a potential candidate for governor in 2026, at the expense of school children.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s harmful posturing and political theater that our kids do not need to be subjected to,\u201d said Sen. Mark Mann, a Democrat from Oklahoma City who previously served on the school board for one of the state\u2019s largest districts.",
      "Concerns about politicizing school standards",
      "National experts on education standards also expressed alarm, noting that Oklahoma has\u00a0historically ranked highly\u00a0among the states for its standards.",
      "Brendan Gillis, the director of teaching and learning at the American Historical Association who oversaw a research project that analyzed standards in all 50 states, said Oklahoma\u2019s social studies standards had been \u201cquite good\u201d until the latest version.",
      "In addition to concerns about election misinformation, Gillis added: \u201cThere was also a lot of biblical content that was sort of shoehorned in throughout the existing standards.\u201d",
      "He said a lot of the references to Christianity and the Bible misinterpreted the history of the country\u2019s founding and lacked historical nuance.",
      "David Griffith, a research director at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education think-tank, said he was not aware of any other states that have tried to promote election misinformation in their curriculum standards.",
      "He called the new standards an \u201cunfortunate\u201d departure from Oklahoma\u2019s traditionally strong social studies standards.",
      "\u201cIt is just inappropriate to promote conspiracy theories about the election in standards,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cAs I stay focused on football, some of the other opportunities that come along, Jordon looks at those and can dig into a little bit deeper,\u201d he said. \u201cBut really what she does helps me spend my time on football, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important to me.\u201d",
      "The 73-year-old coach added that Hudson helps him schedule what he described as \u201cpersonal opportunities,\u201d such as media interviews or speaking arrangements.",
      "He also said Hudson gave him tips on things to exclude or include in his book, such as removing technical terms from certain chapters and dedicating page numbers to certain players and family members.",
      "Belichick and Hudson went viral during an interview with \u201cCBS Sunday Morning\u201d last month in which Hudson herself blocked the now-University of North Carolina football coach from answering a question about their relationship.",

      "The day before Tiffany Slaton\u2019s 28th birthday, she was looking forward to eating a pack of Dunkaroos \u2014 cookies with frosting dip \u2014 that she\u2019d saved as a makeshift birthday cake. It was the only real food she had left after surviving 24 days lost in the Sierra Nevada mountains, subsisting on wild leeks and boiled snow.",
      "What had originally started as a three-day solo camping vacation around Shaver and Huntington lakes in Fresno County, California, turned into a weekslong journey of survival. It ended at a cabin more than 40 miles away, at Vermillion Valley Resort, where Slaton was found by the resort\u2019s owner on Wednesday.",
      "By the time she was rescued, Slaton had endured 13 snowstorms and climbed to altitudes of 11,000 feet, officials said Friday. In addition to dropping 10 pounds from the ordeal, she also lost her tent and sleeping bags, and was forced to abandon her bike at a trailhead sign.",
      "At a press conference Friday alongside her parents and Fresno County Sheriff John Zanoni, Slaton spoke publicly about her journey for the first time. Zanoni called her story one \u201cthey would make movies about.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is truly an incredible story of perseverance, determination and survival,\u201d the sheriff added.",
      "Slaton, an experienced outdoors person from Jeffersonville, Georgia, was reported missing by her parents on April 29 after they had not heard from her in nine days, authorities said. A full-scale operation to locate Slaton was conducted from May 6 to May 10, spanning 600 square miles and deploying a helicopter.",
      "Local authorities and volunteers covered 4,300 miles by foot and vehicle in search of Slaton, officials said Friday.",
      "Slaton began her trek on April 20, equipped with basic camping supplies, including an electric bike, two sleeping bags and a tent, anticipating she would be gone for only a few days.",
      "Early in her journey, Slaton fell off a cliff, she said, and was unable to return to the main road due to a recent avalanche. She was unconscious for about two hours, and upon regaining consciousness she had to splint one of her legs and \u201cpop the other knee back into place.\u201d",
      "She attempted five calls to 911 \u2014 without success \u2014 and couldn\u2019t get her phone\u2019s navigation system to work, she said Friday. Frustrated, she asked her phone for the location of the nearest Starbucks \u2014 it gave her a location 18 miles away, which was closer than retracing her path back to the park\u2019s entrance.",
      "Slaton pressed on, relying on her resourcefulness and what she could find in the wilderness. Her skills as a high-level archer, her medical knowledge as a traveling dialysis technician and her horticultural training proved crucial to her survival. She journaled every day in an effort to \u201ckeep sane.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe worst thing you can do in an emergency situation is panic,\u201d Slaton said.",
      "After five days, Slaton ran out of most of her food and relied on her foraging skills to gather leeks she knew to be native in the Sierra Nevada range. She said she made tea each day with manzanita and pine needles.",
      "Slaton navigated the Kaiser Pass, a 9,000-foot peak buried under 10 to 12 feet of snow before it was plowed earlier this week. She eventually made her way to the Vermilion Valley and Lake Edison, where she was finally rescued.",
      "When Slaton first saw the Vermilion Valley Resort cabin, she thought she was hallucinating and \u201chad somehow managed to make it to the North Pole.\u201d She opened the door, which was unlocked, and inside she found what she described as \u201cthe best sleeping bag I had ever seen.\u201d",
      "Slaton was found on Wednesday \u2014 the day before her 28th birthday \u2014 by resort owner Christopher Gutierrez.

      "Pascal was hesitant to speak when asked about recent deportations, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very scary for an actor who participated in the movie to speak on issues like this.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want people to be safe and to be protected. I want to live on the right side of history,\u201d he said. \u201cI am an immigrant. My parents are refugees from Chile. We fled a dictatorship and I was privileged enough to grow up in the United States after asylum in Denmark.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for that, I don\u2019t know what would have happened to us,\u201d Pascal continued. \u201cI stand by those protections always.\u201d",
      "The cast \u2014 featuring Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone and Austin Butler \u2014 was asked if they feared re-entering the U.S. after making a film with bold, political statements, Variety reported, to which Pascal replied: \u201cFear is the way that they win.\u201d",
      "\u201cEddington\u201d plunges into the U.S. pandemic psyche, plotting a small-town feud that swells to incorporate nationwide events, including mask mandates, the killing of George Floyd and right-left divisions.",
      "Aster\u2019s most politically ambitious film yet received mixed reactions at Cannes, with some critics hailing it as an eerily accurate film about contemporary America and others calling it a tedious and wayward rumination.",

      "\u201cI wrote this film in a state of fear and anxiety about the world, and I wanted to try to pull back and show what it feels like to live in a world where nobody can agree on what is real anymore,\u201d Aster said. \u201cThe last 20 years, we\u2019ve fallen into this age of hyperindividualism.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "For more than five years, Abdul Rahman Waziri put his life on the line to protect U.S. Green Berets. He was a member of an elite unit of Afghans trained to detect hidden explosives \u2014\u00a0considered the tip of the tip of the spear in America\u2019s bloody fight against the Taliban.",
      "Waziri was also one of the lucky ones. Unlike many other Afghans who worked for the U.S. military, he made it out of the country during America\u2019s chaotic withdrawal in 2021. He settled in Houston with his wife, where they were raising their two young girls.",
      "But on April 27, Waziri, 31, was fatally shot outside his apartment complex in a dispute about parking. The shock and heartbreak felt by his family has been compounded by what they consider to be a baffling decision by law enforcement to release the gunman with no charges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Waziri\u2019s brother, Abdullah Khan. \u201cIn Afghanistan, we have no law at all. But if someone gets murdered, the person will not be free.\u201d",
      "Houston police said in a statement that following the shooting, officers at the scene were approached by a man who identified himself as the shooter and said he and Waziri were \u201carguing over parking.\u201d Officers interviewed the man and took possession of his gun but then let him go.",
      "\u201cAfter consulting with the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office, the male was released and [Houston Police Department] investigators will continue their investigation,\u201d the police added. They have not released his name.",
      "Three weeks later, no action has been taken. The authorities have not made any other public statements despite mounting pressure from the area\u2019s growing Afghan community as well as Green Berets who worked with Waziri.",
      "\u201cHe was a lion of a man but also one of the most gentle warriors I have ever seen,\u201d said Ben Hoffman, a former Green Beret who went on missions with Waziri in 2019.",
      "\u201cThis guy risked his life for us,\u201d Hoffman added. \u201cAnd for him to survive all of that and make it out of Afghanistan and then just die in cold blood outside an apartment complex in Houston \u2014 what is going on here?\u201d",
      "Damali Keith, a spokeswoman for the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office, said: \u201cWe are still awaiting additional information from investigators before making a charging decision.\u201d",
      "The Houston Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What surveillance video shows",
      "The shooting took place just before 9:10 p.m. at the Gables at Richmond Apartments, where Waziri had been living since last year.",
      "A surveillance camera captured Waziri driving into the parking area in a white Toyota Camry. He pulled the car to a stop and put on his blinkers. According to his brother, he was coming home from the gym. Waziri was likely going to grab his mail and then park in a spot closer to his apartment, his brother said.",
      "But about 30 seconds after Waziri\u2019s car pulled in, a black Kia sedan turned into the parking lot. It came to a stop directly behind Waziri\u2019s vehicle, according to the surveillance footage, which was provided by the family's attorney.",
      "What happened next is not entirely clear. The area where the cars were stopped can\u2019t be seen on the video because of a structure looming over the parking lot.",
      "But Waziri can be seen walking away from his car, with the other man trailing behind him. They stop and exchange words while pointing in the direction of their vehicles. Then Waziri continues walking away and the other man returns to where their cars were parked.",
      "Seconds later, Waziri looks back in that direction and then walks back toward his car. It\u2019s unclear what happens over the next 55 seconds. But near the end, the other man\u2019s shoes can be seen moving in the direction of his car and then back toward Waziri\u2019s.",
      "Shortly afterward, the other man was captured on the video walking away from the scene.",
      "\u201cIt shocks me that this man was not arrested,\u201d said the Waziri family attorney, Omar Khawaja.",
      "Khawaja said he spoke to a witness and escorted that person to police headquarters five days after the shooting. The witness provided the following account to investigators, according to Khawaja.",
      "After the initial confrontation captured on video, the other man began to kick Waziri\u2019s car. That\u2019s what prompted Waziri to walk back to the vehicles. A physical struggle ensued, with Waziri getting the upper hand, and then the other man returned to his car and retrieved a gun.",
      "Waziri put his hands up and said something along the lines of, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d but the gunman opened fire anyway.",
      "NBC News\u2019 efforts to reach the witness were not successful.",
      "Police said Waziri was shot \u201cmore than one time,\u201d and officers discovered his body lying next to his white Toyota. Khawaja, the family\u2019s attorney, said Waziri was unarmed at the time; he owned a gun but it was at home.",
      "Khawaja said he is aware of at least one other witness who is too afraid to come forward.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the kind of paralysis and fear the community feels,\u201d Khawaja said. \u201cThe guy who just killed this man is still living in the community and with no consequences whatsoever. That\u2019s a chilling effect on witnesses.\u201d",
      "What the law says",
      "Under Texas law, a person has a right to use deadly force if it is believed to be \u201cimmediately necessary\u201d to protect against another\u2019s \u201cuse or attempted use of unlawful force.\u201d",
      "David Crump, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said another factor looms large in a prosecutor\u2019s decision on whether to bring charges: Did the person initiate the altercation?",
      "\u201cIf someone initiates a quarrel and ends up shooting a guy who was unarmed, it seems strange to me that the shooter was not arrested,\u201d Crump said. \u201cBut I have to add that we don\u2019t know all the facts.\u201d",
      "The killing has sparked protests in Houston, where thousands of Afghans have settled after fleeing their homeland. It also prompted some of Waziri\u2019s Green Beret friends to write letters to Houston Mayor John Whitmore demanding justice.",
      "One of those retired Green Berets, Vince Leyva, said in an interview that he used to call Waziri a \u201cgentle giant.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 6-foot-1 and he towered over me,\u201d said Leyva. \u201cBut he was so calm, so well-spoken. He was not a guy who would argue, which is why this really baffles me.\u201d",
      "Waziri and the other Afghan members of the National Mine Reduction Group, or NMRG, would be out in front of U.S. Special Forces members during missions. Their job was to identify and disable improvised explosive devices, but they sometimes found themselves in firefights during Taliban ambushes.",
      "Beyond the risk of getting killed on the job, they were frequently hunted down by insurgents.",
      "\u201cEveryone knew who the NMRG were, especially the Taliban,\u201d said Leyva, who helped train the Afghans. \u201cThey always had targets on their backs, but they were proud to do their job.\u201d",
      "Waziri was so good at it that he was selected to be an instructor, Leyva said, a role he had until U.S. forces withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021.",
      "Waziri was looking out for others even in his last few days in his homeland as the Taliban swiftly seized major cities, according to Shireen Connor, who was part of a grassroots team of veterans and others who helped to coordinate the evacuations of Afghans.",
      "\u201cThe streets of Kabul were engulfed in panic,\u201d Connor said in a letter to the Houston mayor.",
      "\u201cIn the midst of this, Mr. Waziri, a high-profile Taliban target, was setting up safe houses not for himself but for our evacuees. Always helping other people in the face of significant personal peril. How do you define a human being like this?\u201d",
      "After the shooting, Waziri\u2019s wife and two young daughters \u2014 4-year-old Bahar and her 9-month-old baby sister, Zoya \u2014 flew to Florida to stay with his brother.",
      "\u201cHis wife is in very bad condition now,\u201d said Khan, the brother. \u201cShe\u2019s still panicking.\u201d",
      "Khan and Waziri\u2019s wife have yet to tell Bahar that her father is dead. And so, nearly every day, the little girl asks her mother and uncle a string of heartbreaking questions.",
      "Where is my father? When is he coming home? Please, can you just call him?"

      "\"Is this Ocean?\" Winfrey asked in a video posted on TikTok on May 14.",
      "\"Yes, Anne?\" Vuong replied, to which Winfrey said, \"No, this is not Anne. This is Oprah. How are ya?\"",
      "Vuong, completely surprised, asked, \"What?\"",
      "\"This is Oprah Winfrey! How are you?\" she responded.",
      "Vuong was shocked into absolute silence for several seconds, leading Oprah to say, \"Hello?\"",
      "The footage then cuts to Vuong saying, \"Oh my God, are you kidding?\"",
      "Oprah replied, \"No, I'm not kidding you one bit. I'm calling you because, Ocean, I love 'The Emperor of Gladness' so much, and I am so excited to choose it for the Oprah's Book Club!\"",
      "Vuong couldn't believe it, and then shared why the selection was such an honor to him personally.",
      "\"You don't understand how much this means to me,\" Vuong said. \"Your voice was on the background of my entire childhood.\"",
      "Vuong shared that he helped answer the phone at his mother's nail salon as a child, and that Winfrey's show would frequently be playing on the TV.",
      "\"Your voice and your show is the only thing that she values,\" Vuong said.",
      "Vuong's mother died in 2019. He told Winfrey what his mother would have thought about her choice for her book club.",
      "\"Pulitzer, Nobel, all that be damned, but if she was alive today...\" he said, before Winfrey replied and said that it meant to much to her to hear that.",
      "\"I'm so proud that you recognized the love and humanity in the book because that's the love and humanity your career and your show has given us,\" Vuong said. \"You give so many people hope and your voice is literally in our consciousness as we work and try to strive together a life.\"",
      "Vuong, the author of bestselling novel \"On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous,\" shared more about Winfrey's impact on his life in an interview on CBS Mornings on May 13.",
      "\"It's such an honor to have her pick the book, because, you know, where I come from, working class people, the act of reading can be very intimidating,\" he said. \"Most of the clients in my mother's nail salon were working women, single mothers who didn't have second degrees, who only have high school educations.\"",
      "\"And when I watched them, when they saw her book club show, they get up from the chair with a different posture,\" he added.",
      "Vuong said he would watch them get up and say, \"I'm going to walk across this strip mall, I'm going to go to Barnes and Noble and get that book.\"",
      "\"She made the act of reading accessible, and I watched these women feel so empowered, and I think it opened up the possibility of reading for them in ways that they never would have gotten,\" he said. \"And as a little boy, I didn't know I was going to be a writer, but I think I saw that first.\"",
      "\"I said, 'I don't know what that is \u2014 books \u2014 but they can change the posture of somebody's mother so that they can stand a little taller and walk across and get a book with that kind of confidence,' because she gave them a ticket into the discourse,\" he continued. \"And that access means so much to me, especially as a first generation immigrant, as a first generation (person) to go to college, as an educator, it does the world.\""

You did not break her spirit, nor her smile, that lights up every room. You did not break the souls of a mother who gives the best hugs and plays the silliest games with our little girls. You did not break the woman who has made me a better man.\u201d",

      "\u201cWho I am as a country artist, I think I lean more traditional, probably, but I\u2019m always trying to find something new, push the boundaries a little bit,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cListen, I want that as badly as other people seem to. I\u2019m not going to stop trying to manifest that,\u201d she told TODAY.com on Tuesday.",
      "Whether another version of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d ever comes to fruition, Murphy said much of the cast has reunions of their own.",
      "\u201cWe all like try to keep in touch as much as we can,\u201d Murphy said, acknowledging their \u201cbeyond busy\u201d schedules. \u201cBecause it was such a special show for all of us. And we all love each other so much.\u201d",
      "Though the comedy, which ran for six seasons, wrapped five years ago, Murphy said she\u2019s still stopped on the street for one of her character\u2019s iconic lines. When Alexis would bicker with her brother (Dan Levy), she was known to memorably yell, \u201cEw, David!\u201d",
      "Murphy only actually said the line three times in the entire series, but her Valley Girl accent was so memorable that any \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d fan would recognize the phrase.",
      "When fans do remember the line, Murphy said it\u2019s sometimes \u201cscreamed in my face,\u201d while others firmly command the actor, \u201c\u2018Do it now.\u2019\u201d But, she told TODAY.com, she found a way out.",
      "\u201cNow I often just start going, like, \u2018No, how about you do it? And I\u2019m right here with you. I\u2019m just your support animal, and you can go for it.\u2019 And people tend to,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a way out. I\u2019ve planted a little loop for myself.\u201d",
      "Now, Murphy stars in Season 2 of the Hulu drama \u201cNine Perfect Strangers\u201d as Imogen, a character far different from Alexis. But would the two ever be friends?",
      "\u201cThat is a very good question. No, I think Imogen would write Alexis off as a ditz \u2014 even though Alexis is not a ditz,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I think Imogen is a very judgy little minx, and I think she would make a pretty hard judgment and judge a book by its cover and never look back.\u201d"

    "summary": "Benito Skinner discusses what parts of \"Overcompensating\" are based on his own life and the significance of all those pop culture references and hit soundtrack.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 1 of \u201cOvercompensating.\u201d",
      "The opening scene of \u201cOvercompensating\u201d on Prime Video is similar to an experience its star, Benito Skinner, had during one of his first sleepover parties with friends \u2014 just a bit more absurd.",
      "The scene shows a young Skinner rewinding a very specific portion  of the 1997 film \u201cGeorge of the Jungle,\u201d starring Brendan Fraser, until one of his friends asks if they can do something else.",
      "Skinner changes the channel and lands on the beginning of the music video for Britney Spears\u2019 hit 2000 song, \u201cLucky.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think all these moments were kind of pivotal in my journey,\u201d Skinner tells TODAY.com. \u201cLike, \u2018Lucky\u2019 was the song that I think changed my life in so many ways. As a kid, I was like, \u2018Oh, I love Britney in a different way than everyone around me. I\u2019m relating to this song in ways that no one else knows.\u2019\u201d",
      "The pop culture references don\u2019t stop coming in the first season of Skinner\u2019s Prime Video series, which follows a first-year college student, Benny, as he tries to hide his sexuality from those around him and present as a straight man who loves football and girls.",
      "Over the course of \u201cOvercompensating's\u201d eight episodes, Charli XCX performs three pre-\u201cBrat\u201d hits, Megan Fox is featured prominently on a poster in Benny\u2019s dorm room, and cameos include Bowen Yang, Matt Rogers, Kaia Gerber and more. Skinner also brought in TikTok stars like Nadia Alexeev to dance during a frat party scene.",
      "\u201cThat had to be done,\u201d Skinner says. \u201cDrunk girl dancing? Nadia.\u201d",
      "The premise of \u201cOvercompensating\u201d comes from Skinner\u2019s own experiences, he says, but he felt he needed to amp up certain dramatic elements for the show.",
      "\u201cI feel like I really based it on feelings and experiences and relationships, so like the coming out things were as honest and true as we could go,\u201d Skinner says. \u201cThose feel like I did experience pretty much everything in the show.\u201d",
      "He adds that the relationship between his character Benny and his best friend, Carmen, played by Wally Baram, represents the friendships he\u2019s had with women throughout his life.",
      "\u201cThe relationship between Benny and Carmen is something that I felt with women my whole life, of them always being protectors for me,\u201d Skinner says. \u201cSo that feels very real.\u201d",
      "Skinner, who rose to stardom through his comedy and celebrity impressions on social media, says that while certain aspects of the show are true to his real-life experiences, it was important to him and showrunner Scott King to fill the cast with people that will surprise viewers.",
      "\u201cMaybe you think you know them in the pilot, but you don\u2019t,\u201d Skinner explains. \u201cAt a certain point, your life starts to feel kind of like boring and not that interesting \u2014 like, you have to make a TV show, you need stakes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo yeah, at a certain point, I was kind of like, \u2018OK, I feel like my coming out story and these relationships are in there,'\u201d he continues. \u201cBut now, let\u2019s go.\u201d",
      "King tells TODAY.com that when writing the script with Skinner, they weren\u2019t focusing on what situations would be the most dramatic or the most funny.",
      "\u201cWe just wanted it to be real,\u201d King says. \u201cAnd even in the most heightened moments we wanted to play it real.\u201d",
      "King adds that while they were discussing their shared college experiences, he was surprised by how similar they were.",
      "\u201cAs someone who graduated before Benny was even born, he and I, when we were talking about college, even though it was such different times, so different for gay men at those times, too, there was such a universality to our experiences,\u201d King says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s where we were able to capture the comedy and the real.\u201d",
      "About those needle drops...",
      "Music plays a central role in the show, Skinner says, with tracks coming in from Lorde, Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj.",
      "During a recent visit to Northwestern University, Skinner says he went to a sorority house, and some of the members asked about his show and its soundtrack.",
      "\u201cI said a few (songs) from the show, and they were like, \u2018Totally,\u2019\u201d Skinner recalls. \"And I was like, \u2018Wait. Oh, so it\u2019s like, a college bubble, like nothing has changed.\u2019 I love that.\u201d",
      "Charli XCX notably plays herself in the show and serves as an executive producer on the series.",
      "\u201cI always knew that she had to be the college concert. Because when I was in college, I went to the \u2018Sucker\u2019 tour alone, because I didn\u2019t want anyone to know, because that\u2019s totally gay,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I knew it had to be her.\u201d",
      "When working on Charli XCX's role in the script, Skinner says he wanted to give her more than just a performance.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we just wanted to slot her in \u2014 this is a comedy,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, we want people to die and be surprised and also, maybe if we can, weave in some kind of cathartic moment for musicians who are singing their life\u2019s work to college kids who are on molly. Like, let\u2019s do this.\u201d",
      "In the scene, Charli XCX performs three of her older hits, \"Boom Clap,\" \"Boys\" and \"I Love It,\" while Benny starts to feel ill from a hazing incident in which he had to swallow several live beta fish. His bestie Carmen was forced to eat extremely cheesy Italian food (even though she's lactose intolerant), and the pair try to make it through the concert. But they both end up in bathroom stalls next to each other getting extremely sick during her performance.",
      "The juxtaposition of singing your life's work in front of hundreds of inebriated college students was a moment Charli XCX was plenty familiar with, Skinner says.",
      "\u201cWhen I sent it to her, she was like, 'I think I have said some of these things about playing \"Boom Clap\" at a college.' Like, \u2018Why are you guys making me do this 100 times a year?\u2019\u201d he recalls Charli XCX saying.",
      "\u201cI mean it was such a no brainer that she was genius and was gonna kill it, so we had to give her as much as we could,\" Skinner adds. \"And she did it in between \u2018Sweat\u2019 tour shows.\u201d",
      "Another music moment in \"Overcompensating\" that was inspired by Skinner's own life involves Lady Gaga\u2019s song, \u201cThe Edge of Glory.\u201d After having a strange experience at his school's secret society, Benny starts to have a panic attack and decides to go up to an openly gay student and ask him to hang out.",
      "While Benny's talking with the student, the opening notes of \"The Edge of Glory\" begin to play, a nod to what the track feels like in Skinner's own life.",
      "\u201cLike leaving high school, rolling up the windows and blasting that and sobbing on the way home \u2014 like, that\u2019s me,\u201d Skinner says of his experience with the song.",
      "\u201cI think every song in it, it\u2019s why we named the episodes after these songs,\" he adds. \"I feel like, in college, music is currency.\u201d",
      "\"Overcompensating\" is now streaming on Prime Video."

    "story": [
      "Warning: This article contains spoilers for \u201cFinal Destination Bloodlines.\u201d",
      "The most basic rule of any \"Final Destination\" movie is that, ultimately, no one survives \u2014\u00a0except for one character: The endlessly intriguing mortician William J. Bludworth, played by horror legend Tony Todd.",
      "So when Todd, of \"Candyman\" fame, passed away last November at 69, it was only fitting that this death-obsessed series gave him a sendoff as intriguing and memorable as the character he played.",
      "Todd's role as Bludworth in \"Final Destination Bloodlines,\" released May 16, was one of his final on-screen appearances, filmed just months before he passed away, directors Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky tell TODAY.com.",
      "\"What he developed with Bludworth is really special because it\u2019s the only piece of the franchise that continues,\" Lipovsky says, adding that he brought a degree of \"charm and mystery\" to the role that was \"delightful\" and inspired countless fan theories.",
      "The directors knew he was ill when they were crafting the story and with filming with him, Lipovsky explains.",
      "\"So we knew it was going to be his last 'Final Destination' movie and, potentially, his last film ever.\"",
      "They took that responsibility seriously and worked with Todd to create a backstory for his character that would help answer some lingering questions.",
      "But they also wanted to \"give him an opportunity to say goodbye to the character, to the audience and all the people that love everything that he's been doing,\" Lipovsky says.",
      "In the scene, Bludworth reveals that he's sick and knows his own time is limited. There are ways to cheat death, he tells the characters, but things are likely to get \"messy.\"",
      "Sooner or later, he says, death is coming for all of us. \"I intend to enjoy the time I have left,\" he tells them, \"and I suggest you do the same.\" He continues, \"Life is precious. Enjoy every single second. You never know when.\"",
      "The fact that Todd knew he was likely facing his final months in real life \"gave that scene real authenticity,\" says longtime \u201cFinal Destination\u201d producer Craig Perry, adding that it \"translated into one of the most poignant moments in the entire franchise.\"",
      "And Todd's contribution to the series was \"enormous,\" Perry tells TODAY.com. When initially casting the for the role, which first appeared in the original \"Final Destination\" in 2000, \"we wanted somebody who always looked like he had a secret that he wasn't telling, a sort of enigma behind his eyes,\" Perry says.",
      "In Todd, they found all that and more.",
      "\"We really felt that Tony had all of that gravitas and mystery in his very DNA,\" Perry says. \"His presence brought a sense of foreboding medicine mystery, and beyond that, he was able to have a playfulness that made the character fun to watch.\"",
      "Todd elevated basic exposition \u2014 and transcended typical \"magical Negro\" horror tropes. In fact, Stein says, part of their direction with the character was \u201cwanting to kind of explode that trope and show that, no, Bludworth was a real person.\u201d",
      "In the previous movies, Bludworth has been a \"mysterious mentor figure, so (Todd) was very excited to show how he knows so much about death \u2014\u00a0as a real person,\" Stein explains. \"It's not because he's an angel or death itself,\" he continues, \"it's because he had this experience in his life.\"",
      "Taking the idea even further, Bludworth tells this latest crop of young people trying to deceive death that they aren't the first who have come to him for advice \u2014\u00a0and he's done with all that.",
      "\"That was to comment on even how cinema has changed a bit,\" Stein says. \"Like, we're not doing that anymore.\"",
      "While filming, Todd was \"just so incredibly joyful,\" Stein recalls. He was physically weak, but \"so excited,\" he says. Todd especially wanted to take photos with the actors who play Bludworth's mother and child self, Stein says, as his characters in other films often didn't get such fleshed-out backstories.",
      "And when it came time to perform his final speech, the directors told him to \"throw the script away for a moment and just speak from the heart,\" Lipovsky says. \"It was a unique opportunity for him to speak in character to what's happening in the story, but on a secondary level, be speaking to the audience about himself.\"",
      "The take in the film is the one Todd improvised.",
      "\"Even the way that he says 'Good luck' and winks at the camera as he walks out and starts whistling is sort of his own gift of talking about heavy things, but with a dark and delightful charm,\" Lipovsky says. \"The whole cast and crew couldn't believe that he had given us that.\""

    "story": [
      "A day after Justin Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, alleged that Blake Lively \u201cdemanded\u201d Taylor Swift release a statement supporting her, Judge Lewis J. Liman has had the accusations stricken from the case.",
      "On Thursday, May 15, Judge Liman \u2014 who is presiding over the trial between the two \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d stars set for\u00a0March 9, 2026, in New York \u2014 described Freedman's letter as \"improper\" and said it \"must be stricken,\" in a court ruling obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "\"It is irrelevant to any issue before this Court and does not request any action from this Court,\" Judge Liman wrote.",
      "He continued, \"The sole purpose of the Letter is to 'promote public scandal' by advancing inflammatory accusations, on information and belief, against Lively and her counsel. It transparently invites a press uproar by suggesting that Lively and her counsel attempted to 'extort' a well-known celebrity.\"",
      "At the end of Judge Liman's statement, he added, \"Counsel is advised that future misuse of the Court\u2019s docket may be met with sanctions.\"",
      "Lively's spokesperson sent a statement to TODAY.com reacting to Judge Liman granting the request of the Lively's legal team to remove Freedman's allegations from the record.",
      "\u201cIt took the court less than 24 hours to see through Mr. Freedman\u2019s irrelevant, improper and inflammatory accusations, strike them, remove them from the court and warn Mr. Freedman that further misconduct may be met with sanctions,\u201d Lively's spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Freedman for a comment.",
      "Liman's decision regarding Freedman's accusations is the latest development involving\u00a0the legal battle between the two former co-stars.\u00a0Following Swift\u2019s spokesperson\u00a0addressing the pop star reportedly being subpoenaed\u00a0in Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal back-and-forth, Freedman filed\u00a0a letter\u00a0with\u00a0Judge Liman on May 14, in which the attorney wrote that the purpose of the subpoena was to access discovery regarding \u201cwitness tampering and evidence spoliation.\u201d",
      "He said that the counsel for Wayfarer Parties, which includes Baldoni, received \u201cinformation from a source who is highly likely to have reliable information\u201d alleging that Lively asked Swift to delete their text messages. Freedman then claimed that Michael Gottlieb, Lively\u2019s lawyer, contacted Swift\u2019s attorney and \u201cdemanded that Ms. Swift release a statement of support for Ms. Lively, intimating that, if Ms. Swift refused to do so, private text messages of a personal nature in Ms. Lively\u2019s possession would be released.\u201d",
      "Freedman further described the alleged demands as \u201cinappropriate and apparently extortionate threats\u201d and said a representative for Swift responded to them in \u201cat least one written communication\u201d sent to Gottlieb.",
      "\u201cIt is those communications that the Wayfarer Parties seek to obtain by way of subpoena, as they would evidence an attempt to intimidate and coerce a percipient witness in this litigation,\u201d Baldoni\u2019s lawyer continued.",
      "TODAY.com obtained a statement from Gottlieb regarding Freedman\u2019s letter to the judge, in which he called the accusations \u201ccategorically false.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt should be unnecessary to respond to anonymously sourced, baseless, allegations recklessly leveled without any supporting evidence. It is worth stating for the record, however, that each of the allegations in the Freedman Letter is unequivocally and demonstrably false. As a legal matter, the Freedman Letter is improper. It does not seek any form of relief, is irrelevant to any motion currently pending before the Court, and serves no legitimate purpose. It is not useful to the Court in any respect,\u201d Lively's lawyers wrote.",
      "They also said that Freedman\u2019s letter appeared intended to \u201claunder scandalous and defamatory allegations about Ms. Lively and opposing counsel into the press.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Swift\u2019s rep for a comment, as well.",
      "Swift\u2019s spokesperson previously issued a statement regarding the subpoena, asserting that the musician has no connection to the movie adaptation besides her song \u201cMy Tears Ricochet\u201d being featured on the soundtrack. Her rep said that the witness summons was a way to generate \u201ctabloid clickbait.\u201d",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Her rep continued, \u201cThe connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, \u2018My Tears Ricochet.\u2019 Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift\u2019s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.\u201d",
      "Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal case began on Dec. 20 when Lively filed an 80-page sexual harassment complaint alleging that Baldoni created a hostile workplace environment on the set of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d and that he later launched a smear campaign to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation. She also alleged that he crossed the line while they filmed intimate scenes and that he harassed her on set.",
      "Freedman reacted to the accusations in a statement to TODAY.com at the time, calling them \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively then filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company, Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel on Dec. 31. Her attorney alleged there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\u201d",
      "Following an article about Lively\u2019s accusations, Baldoni sued The New York Times for libel. He also filed a lawsuit against Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, Lively\u2019s rep Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm on Jan. 16, accusing them of defamation and disregarding contractual claims.",
      "Swift became linked to the case when Baldoni filed his suit, which included alleged text messages exchanged between him and Lively. In the documents, a \u201cTaylor\u201d is referenced and described as a \u201cmegacelebrity friend.\u201d",
      "Baldoni\u2019s team confirmed to NBC News at the time that the \u201cTaylor\u201d in the suit was the pop singer, who has been friends with Lively for years.",
      "According to NBC News, one alleged text from Lively read, \u201cIf you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you\u2019ll appreciate that I\u2019m Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. You will too, I can promise you.\u201d"

      "Although she was still adamant that separation was best to help \u201cfigure out what\u2019s best for our relationship,\u201d Jen Affleck allowed her husband to move back in. However, she made him promise not to talk over her.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to have a good time right now because I know that this is making Zac uncomfortable and because of how both Demi and Jessi treated my relationship prior to this. It makes me question their intentions,\u201d Jen Affleck said in a confessional interview.",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how bad this would upset Zac. I just wanted to be the fun friend who just said, 'Yeah, and that it would be so awesome.' But I didn\u2019t really question their intentions behind it and I also didn\u2019t ask myself how I felt about it,\u201d she said in a confessional interview.",
      "The #MomTok star also said her husband was \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cjumping to conclusions\u201d after the party. She called the experience \u201ctriggering.\u201d",

      "\u201cI am frustrated because I feel like I\u2019m having to stick up and defend our family and it\u2019s making me look like the bad guy when these are your friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIf my friends were doing these kinds of things to us, I would confront them or I would drop them.\u201d",

    "summary": "Oliver Stark unpacks the ending of \"9-1-1\" Season 8, including if Buck is moving or leaving the 118.",
    "story": [
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: This article contains spoilers from the \"9-1-1\" Season Eight finale, \"Seismic Shifts.\"\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8",
      "In typical \"9-1-1\" fashion, Season Eight ended with a bang \u2014 well, several.",
      "After starting the season with a bee-nado (a tornado composed of bees, for anyone wondering), the Season Eight finale saw the 118 race to a more familiar scene: an infrastructure collapse.",
      "The 118, still reeling without its captain, splits off in pairs at the scene of the high-rise building collapse, with Henrietta \"Hen\" Wilson (Aisha Hinds) and Howard \u201cChimney\u201d Han (Kenneth Choi) rescuing several tenants, as Evan \u201cBuck\u201d Buckley (Oliver Stark) and Ravi Panikkar (Anirudh Pisharody) go to what's left of the upper levels.",
      "LAPD Sgt. Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) was on scene when the apartment complex started crumbling down. She rushes back in to help, finding two pinned tenants in the building's laundry room. As their conditions worsen, she sends a survivor to get help, and Chimney joins her.",
      "But with the team still inside, the unsteady building continues to shake, rocked with mini-explosions, leaving Buck and Ravi trapped with a victim and Chimney and Athena's exit route completely blocked.",
      "For Buck, it marks a very different circumstance than one of the team's last big emergencies. In Episode 14, all of the 118 were locked inside a lab \u2014 except for Buck.",
      "\"I think he's almost more comfortable being trapped as long as he's able to do his job,\" Oliver Stark tells TODAY.com of the finale. \"Being on the outside was the most jarring thing for him.\"",
      "The lab disaster notably ended with the shocking death of Capt. Bobby Nash (Peter Krause). Quarantined in the lab, members of the 118 were exposed to a deadly virus. Chimney was infected, and he was saved via Athena and Buck\u2019s heroics to acquire an antidote. But Bobby \u2014\u00a0Athena\u2019s husband \u2014 was also infected and died in the lab.",
      "In the finale \u2014\u00a0back to true \"9-1-1\" fashion \u2014 the 118 and Athena save the day, with no further casualties.",
      "Here's how it all goes down (literally) \u2014 and, as Stark says, how the circumstances are hopefully introducing a more \"mature\" Buck looking ahead to the show's already-renewed Season Nine.",
      "How does '9-1-1' Season 8 end?",
      "The 118 has since seemingly fallen apart in the aftermath of Bobby's death. While they showed a united front at Bobby's funeral in Episode 16 \u2014 with Eddie Diaz (Ryan Guzman) returning from El Paso, Texas, after moving earlier in the season to be with his son \u2014 they are each grieving separately in the most recent episodes.",
      "Chimney and Athena, both struggling with Bobby's sacrifice, can barely stand to be in the same room. Meanwhile, Buck and Eddie have another fight, with Eddie accusing Buck of being selfish about Eddie's new job opportunity in El Paso amid his grief.",
      "For the 118, Episode 18 opens on a somber note. All gathered at the station, the team throws a going away lunch for Eddie, who's set to report for duty at an El Paso firehouse the next morning. He's given his turnout uniform, and he and Chris enjoy one last shared meal with the team. Hen says she's turned down taking the job of captain, while Buck reveals he's put in for a transfer.",
      "\"Out of the 118?\" Eddie asks.",
      "\"It's just a number now,\" Buck responds.",
      "The team then heads to the call at the building collapse. Stark says being in the thick of the action is Buck at his best.",
      "\"There are different sides of Buck, and some of them are a bit sillier. I don't know, he's just like guileless and golden retriever-y, but there is no doubt that he's an extremely adept firefighter,\" Stark says. \"So I think him being in the emergency is where he's going to thrive and be able to do his best. I think it's a chance as well to see this more mature, calmer, 'let's get to work' version of Buck.\"",
      "While the rest of team rescues victims, Eddie is packing up his gear and preparing to head to the airport with Chris to go back to Texas. Eddie then sees reports of the building collapse and the search-and-rescue response on the news. Donning his familiar uniform, he heads toward the rubble, just in time to save Buck, Ravi and one of the victims before the building collapses further.",
      "\"I was watching the news, had a bit of FOMO,\" Eddie tells Buck over the radio, before shooting a line gun to their location, allowing the trio to escape.",
      "Stark says for Buck, that moment of Eddie coming to save the day represents a return to the status quo.",
      "\"I think just a case of things getting back to the way they're meant to be, and as we touched on, maybe never being quite the same, but the steps to repair slowly being built,\" Stark tells TODAY.com of Eddie's save.",
      "The team, Eddie included, then head to rescue Athena, Chimney and their patients. In the end, everyone makes it back alive, with zero civilian casualties from the building collapse.",
      "After the emergency and back at the station, Chimney notices the team rapidly splitting off despite their success as a united front. Eddie checks his phone looking for a flight back to El Paso while Buck puts away his turnouts. An emboldened Chimney orders everyone to stop moving and tells Eddie he's not leaving L.A. and Buck that he's not transferring.",
      "\"This is our fire house. This is the 118, and it's not just a number. It's us,\" an emotional Chimney tells the team. \"... Cap is gone. But leaving won't change that. It won't make you feel any less sad. It just means that you'll be sad all alone.\"",
      "He rounds out his speech with strict orders for everyone \u2014 Buck and Eddie included \u2014 to get some rest before reporting for their next shift \"right here, together.\"",
      "A shocked Hen responds, \"Copy that, Cap \u2014 I mean, Chim,\" suggesting the 118 might not have to look far in Season Nine for its next leader.",
      "Asked what stops Buck from considering leaving the 118, Stark tells TODAY.com, \"It's not really his decision.\"",
      "\"It's very much told to him,\" Stark says. \"'Put your stuff down. Get to work. This is where we live.' And it's what I think everybody needs to hear.\"",
      "Eddie being ordered to stay brings in the literal question of living situations.",
      "In Episode Nine, Buck moved into Eddie's house as a subletter so Eddie could follow Chris to El Paso. Since Eddie's return to L.A. for the funeral, he's been staying on Buck's couch in his old house.",
      "In regards to their dynamic as roommates, Stark jokes, \"Apparently they work out who's going to do the groceries and then they don't always follow through on that.\" (In Episode 17, Buck and Eddie's fight occurred in the kitchen and started after Buck picked up the groceries though Eddie said he would.)",
      "\"They work a lot of hours. That's the one thing as well. I don't think they spend a lot of time at home,\" he adds of Buck and Eddie's time as roommates. \"So yeah, that is for the audience to fill in the blank for themselves.\"",
      "In the final minutes of Episode 18, it's revealed that Eddie and Chris have moved back, Buck is looking for a new apartment and Athena is putting the now-finished house she had been building with Bobby on the market.",
      "After he's asked by his realtor why he's leaving his last place, Buck says, \"It wasn't really mine. I was subletting.\"",
      "\"Buck is looking for his own place again, and I just think that he's ready to \u2014\u00a0kind of the combination of everything's that's been happening through the season \u2014\u00a0the old apartment, the loft, is gone. This is Eddie's place. Who am I going to be, stand on my own two feet?\" Stark says of what Buck is looking for.",
      "A move may prove disheartening to longtime supporters of a potential romance between Buck and Eddie. Earlier in Season Eight, the show introduced the possibility onscreen for the first time after Buck reconnects with his ex, who insinuates he'd be open to getting back together \"now that the competition's (Eddie) is out of the way.\" Buck was later point blank asked by sister Maddie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is he was in love with Eddie, which he adamantly denied.",
      "\"You know when something huge happens, your personal dramas, they just, everything falls by the wayside a little bit,\" Stark says. \"I don't know if that will be addressed next year or what.\"",
      "Asked if Buck continued to think about that question before Bobby's death, Stark says he thinks Buck \"shut it down.\"",
      "\"I don't think the idea is that Buck went home and looked in the mirror and said, 'Wait, am I in love with Eddie?' I think it came so far out of left field for him when Tommy first said it,\" Stark says. \"I don't think the idea is that we were saying Buck now is questioning if that's true.\"",
      "\"And, you know, look, (showrunner) Tim (Minear) will make that decision if it is or not,\" he adds. \"But I don't think in that moment that the story was now Buck is wondering if he is. I think Buck thought, 'No, you're absolutely wrong. What are you talking about?' And yeah, we'll go from there.\"",
      "Overall, Stark says he hopes Bobby's death in Season Eight will give him a chance to play a more \"mature Buck\" going forward.",
      "\"I was excited that maybe this could be the thing that helps Buck mature or grow into a different place at a different stage,\" he says. \"So I think that\u2019s, from my point of view, anyway, what the fallout or the repercussions for Buck will be.\""

    "story": [
      "For six seasons, Carrie Bradshaw chased after commitment while wearing Manolos and writing her weekly column. Ironically, at the beginning of \"Sex and the City,\" it was Sarah Jessica Parker who hemmed and hawed over signing the dotted line.",
      "The 60-year-old actor spoke about her early hesitation during a two-part appearance in the \"Are You a Charlotte?\" podcast, hosted by longtime \"Sex and the City\" co-star Kristin Davis. Speaking to Davis, Parker explained why she \"panicked\" at the idea of \"committing\" to the series, even after she shot the show's pilot, which first aired in 1998.",
      "As Parker explained it, the experience of filming the show's first episode was \"lovely,\" but she \"forgot all about it\" until one day, she was walking down a street in New York City when she ran into a well-known producer who complimented her on the show.",
      "\"Then I went on with my day, and when the show was picked up, I panicked,\" she recalled. \"I was like, I can\u2019t be on a TV show. I don\u2019t think I'm suited for that life.\"",
      "Prior to \"Sex and the City,\" Parker had made a name for herself, having starred in \"Square Pegs,\" \"A Year in the Life,\" and \"Equal Justice,\" the latter of which was the only one to make it two seasons. Parker explained that the brief length of each series afforded her a chance to \"bounce around\" and appear in other films and work with experienced actors and directors.",
      "\"Then I moved on and I would do a play or I'd do some readings and then I'd do a part in a movie,\" she explained. \"I really thought, like that is the goal, like the journeyman is the goal.\"",
      "\"The idea of a television series meant that I couldn\u2019t do all those things ... and that I would get in the same car every day, and it just kind of felt like somebody was, you know, putting their hand over my mouth or something,\" she explained, adding that she eventually called up her agent.",
      "\"I talked to my agents and I said, 'You know, hey, can you get me out of this?'\" she recalled before noting that, eventually, she learned that because HBO was still relatively new and an \"unknown species\" to many, she had the benefit of flexibility.",
      "Eventually, she was encouraged to try it out for just a year.",
      "\u201cAnd I never looked back,\u201d she said. \u201cI was never not happy to be there. There was no place I would rather have been than on our set.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Ahead of her new book, \"Atmosphere,\" Taylor Jenkins Reid is opening up about her sexuality, detailing how it impacts her writing process and being perceived a certain way by fans.",
      "In a May 15 interview with Time magazine, Reid revealed she is bisexual, despite many fans assuming she was straight as she is married to a man.",
      "\u201cIt has been hard at times to see people dismiss me as a straight woman, but I also didn\u2019t tell them the whole story,\u201d she said.",
      "Reid admitted that assumptions about her sexuality are nothing new for her. In fact, they began when she was a teenager when she dressed differently than the social norm.",
      "\"I got hit pretty quickly with, 'Why can\u2019t you dress more like a girl? Why don\u2019t you do your nails? Why do you talk that way? Can\u2019t you be a little bit quieter?'\" she told the outlet. \"I started to get people who would say, \u2018Oh, I get why you dress like a boy\u2014you\u2019re gay.'\"",
      "But Reid didn't feel like she identified with being labeled as gay, as she was attracted to both sexes \u2014 her first love was a man and then, in her early 20s, she fell in love with a woman. With both loves, however, people doubted if it was the right course for her.",
      "\"This was the late '90s, so nobody was talking about bisexuality. And if they were, it was to make fun of people,\" Reid told the outlet. \"The messages about bisexuality were you just want attention, or it was a stop on the way to gayville.",
      "\"I found that very painful, because I was being told that I didn\u2019t know myself, but I did,\" she added.",
      "Reid hasn\u2019t been shy in expressing her sexuality through her writing, penning characters who fall on different ends of the spectrum of sexuality.",
      "In \u201cDaisy Jones & The Six,\u201d the main romance centers around a heterosexual love triangle, while \u201cThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\u201d details a love story between two women. Meanwhile, \u201cMalibu Rising,\" which was Read with Jenna's pick for June 2021, showcases mainly heterosexual relationships, but one character experiences a queer awakening.",
      "Her new book, \"Atmosphere,\" out June 3, allowed Reid to explore more of her attraction to women. The novel features a love story between one woman in outer space and one on the ground.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like time for me to write a very high-stakes, dramatic love story,\" the author told Time.",
      "While she may not have always been open with the public about the specifics of her sexuality, she told Time that she was always honest with those closest to her. Her husband, screenwriter Alex Jenkins Reid, even showed her an idea that describes someone's sexuality as a house with many rooms.",
      "\"My attraction to women is a room in the house that is my identity \u2014 Alex understood this book was about me spending time in that room,\u201d Reid said. \"He was so excited for me, like, \u2018What a great way for you to express this side of you.\u2019 And he helped me get the book to be as romantic and beautiful as it could be.\"",
      "Reid also understands that because she's married to a man, she gets \"straight-passing\" privileges that others don't receive.",
      "\"How do I talk about who I really am with full deference to the life experiences of other people?\" she told Time. \"Basically, where I came down is I can talk about who I am, and then people can think about that whatever they want.\""

      "He also said Nelson has an innate ability to connect with his music.",
      "\u201cWillie is the Sinatra of country music,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you sing laid back like that, like Tony Bennett does, he just says it like he feels it, and he puts it where he feels it.

    "summary": "Details are murky, but the plan is under serious enough consideration that the administration has discussed it with Libyan leadership.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is working on a plan to permanently relocate up to\u00a01\u00a0million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Libya, five people with knowledge of the effort told NBC News.",
      "The plan is under serious enough consideration that the administration\u00a0has discussed\u00a0it with Libya\u2019s leadership, two people with direct knowledge of the plans and a former U.S. official said.",
      "In exchange for the resettling of Palestinians, the administration would potentially release to Libya billions of dollars of funds that the U.S. froze more than a decade ago, those three people said.",
      "No final agreement has been reached, and Israel has been kept informed of the administration\u2019s discussions, the same three sources said.",
      "The State Department and the National Security Council did not respond to multiple requests for comment before this article was published. After publication, a spokesperson told NBC News, \u201cthese reports are untrue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe situation on the ground is untenable for such a plan. Such a plan was not discussed and makes no sense,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said that Hamas, the U.S.-designated terrorist group that has run Gaza, was not aware of any discussions about moving Palestinians to Libya.",
      "\u201cPalestinians are very rooted in their homeland, very strongly committed to the homeland and they are ready to fight up to the end and to sacrifice anything to defend their land, their homeland, their families, and the future of their children,\u201d Naim said in response to questions from NBC News. \u201c[Palestinians] are exclusively the only party who have the right to decide for the Palestinians, including Gaza and Gazans, what to do and what not to do.\u201d",
      "Representatives of the Israeli government declined to comment.",
      "Libya has been plagued by instability and warring political factions throughout the nearly 14 years since a civil war broke out in the country and its longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, was toppled. Libya is struggling to care for its current population as two rival governments, one in the west led by Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and one in the east led by Khalifa Haftar, are actively and violently fighting for control.\u00a0The State Department currently advises Americans not to travel to Libya \u201cdue to crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\u201d",
      "Dbeibah\u2019s government could not be reached for comment. Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "How many Palestinians in Gaza would voluntarily leave to live in Libya is an open question. One idea administration officials have discussed is to provide Palestinians with financial incentives such as free housing and even a stipend, the former U.S. official said.",
      "The details of when or how\u00a0any plan to relocate Palestinians to Libya could be implemented\u00a0are\u00a0murky, and an effort to resettle up to 1 million people there would likely face significant obstacles.",
      "Such an effort would likely be extremely expensive, and it\u2019s not clear\u00a0how the Trump administration would seek to pay for it. In the past, the administration has said Arab nations would help with\u00a0rebuilding Gaza after the war there ends, but they have been critical of Trump\u2019s idea of permanently relocating Palestinians.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration has also looked at Libya as a place where it could send some immigrants it wants to deport from the U.S. However, plans to send one group of immigrants to Libya were stalled by a federal judge this month.",
      "Moving up to 1 million Palestinians to Libya could put far more of a strain on the fragile country.",
      "The\u00a0CIA\u2019s most recent publicly available estimate\u00a0of Libya\u2019s current population is about 7.36 million. In terms of population, Libya absorbing\u00a01\u00a0million more people\u00a0would be equivalent to the U.S. taking in about 46 million.",
      "Precisely where Palestinians would be resettled in Libya\u00a0has not been determined, according to the former U.S. official. Administration officials are looking at\u00a0options for housing them and every potential method for transporting them from Gaza to Libya \u2014 by air, land and sea \u2014is being considered,\u00a0according to one of the people with direct knowledge of the effort.",
      "Any of those methods would likely prove cumbersome and time-consuming, as well as costly.",
      "It would take around 1,173 flights on the world\u2019s largest passenger airplane, the Airbus A380, at its maximum passenger capacity to transport 1 million people, for instance. With no airport in Gaza, moving anyone from there on flights would first require transporting them to an airport in the region. If Israel does not want to allow Palestinians to come through its territory, the closest airport would be in Cairo, about 200 miles away.",
      "Transportation by land from Gaza through Egypt to Benghazi, Libya\u2019s second-largest city, which is farther east than the capital, Tripoli, would require driving about 1,300 miles. Automobiles typically hold fewer passengers than other modes of transportation. About 55 people can fit in an intercity passenger bus.",
      "Up to 2,000 people can fit on the top-end versions of some of the ferries the U.S. used to transport civilians along the Mediterranean Sea to escape Libya\u2019s civil war in 2011. If those vessels were to be used \u2014 and assuming that they didn\u2019t need to refuel and weather conditions were good \u2014 it would take hundreds of trips lasting more than a day each way for up to 1 million people to travel from Gaza to Benghazi.",
      "The plan under discussion is part of\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s vision for a postwar Gaza, which he said in February the U.S. would seek to \u201cown\u201d and rebuild as what he called \u201cthe Riviera of the Middle East,\u201d two current U.S. officials, the former U.S. official and the two people with direct knowledge of the effort said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to take over that piece, develop it and create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it will be something the entire Middle East can be proud of,\u201d Trump said at the time.",
      "To achieve his goal for the reconstruction of Gaza, Trump has said Palestinians there would have to be permanently resettled elsewhere.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t live in Gaza right now, and I think we need another location. I think it should be a location that\u2019s going to make people happy,\u201d Trump said in February during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Trump outlined a goal of finding \u201ca beautiful area to resettle people permanently in nice homes, and where they can be happy and not be shot, not be killed, not be knifed to death like what\u2019s happening in Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think people should be going back to Gaza,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump\u2019s idea, which blindsided some of his top aides, including\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio, when he announced it,\u00a0drew criticism from America\u2019s Arab allies\u00a0and\u00a0U.S. lawmakers from both parties.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see what the Arab world says but, you know, that\u2019d be problematic at many, many levels,\u201d Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said at the time.",
      "The U.S. and Israel in March also\u00a0rejected a proposal from Egypt\u00a0for rebuilding Gaza without relocating Palestinians.",
      "The administration\u2019s work on a Libya plan comes as Trump\u2019s relationship with Netanyahu has become strained, in part because of Israel\u2019s decision to launch a new military offensive in Gaza.",
      "The Trump administration has considered multiple locations for resettling Palestinians living in Gaza, according to a senior administration official, a former U.S. official familiar with the discussions and one of the people with direct knowledge of the effort.",
      "Syria, with its new leadership following the ouster of Bashar al Assad in December, also is under discussion as a possible location for resettling Palestinians currently\u00a0in Gaza, according to one of the people with direct knowledge of the effort and a former U.S. official familiar with the discussions.",
      "The Trump administration has taken steps toward restoring diplomatic relations with Syria. Trump announced on Tuesday that the U.S. would lift sanctions on Syria and met briefly with the country\u2019s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, on Wednesday."

Schoolchildren eat simple breakfasts while squatting on sidewalks, and even a local official complained that the remote mountain villages lacked access to the latest 5G internet connection.",
      "But Chinese officials point to overall progress in this thickly forested, highly mountainous border region in southwest China as a reason for their \u201cconfidence\u201d in the country\u2019s development model, and in its ability to weather any trade war with the United States.",
      "\u201cWe have full confidence and the capability to overcome all difficulties,\u201d Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying said last week during a government-sponsored trip to the rural county of Malipo in Yunnan province, on the border with Vietnam.",
      "\u201cAs for what the United States is doing, we really don\u2019t want any kind of war, but if we have to face up to reality, then we have no fear at all,\u201d she told reporters at a middle school. \u201cThe ordinary people already feel the suffering from the tariff war, so I really hope the [U.S.] administration will come back to normal.\u201d",

      "She and other officials said Malipo, where 233,000 people are spread among several towns and hundreds of \u201cvillage groups,\u201d is a model for China\u2019s poverty alleviation efforts in recent decades. Per capita disposable income in Malipo was $2,300 a year last year, compared with about $69 a year in 1992.",
      "But Beijing\u2019s professed confidence belies real concern about the work that remains to be done as well as the potential impact of U.S. tariffs as China struggles with structural imbalances and slowing economic growth.",
      "The situation spans China\u2019s urban-rural divide and is obvious even to residents of Malipo.",

      "More than 450 million of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people live in rural areas, and getting them to spend more on consumer products is crucial as China tries to reduce its economic dependence on exports threatened by tariffs.",
      "China has also touted its \u201cpoverty alleviation\u201d program as a model for developing countries in the Global South that face similar challenges.",
      "\u201cThe experience of Malipo in poverty alleviation has global significance,\u201d said Liu Guiqing, 40, a senior Chinese diplomat who is also county vice mayor of Malipo under a program that partners central government ministries and wealthy provinces and institutions with impoverished areas.",
      "Hua said the strength of China\u2019s system is its ability to \u201cconcentrate resources\u201d on people\u2019s urgent needs. Beijing is thought to have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on poverty alleviation since 2015.",
      "China\u2019s approach to reducing inequality combines \u201ccoercive top-down control\u201d with high social spending in an effort to \u201chighlight the perceived failures of liberal free-market capitalism,\u201d Rana Mitter, a historian and political scientist at the Harvard Kennedy School, wrote in a new Foreign Affairs article.",
      "Programs such as the one in Malipo are \u201can increasingly important part of China\u2019s messaging, that it has development solutions for rural as well as urban areas,\u201d Mitter told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is likely to be particularly attractive in the many Global South countries that still have large agricultural sectors and may look to Chinese examples to find ways to modernize their own rural area,\u201d he said.",
      "Companies investing in Malipo are still motivated by the \u201cinvisible hand of the market forces,\u201d said Jason Choi, director of the Sunwah Group, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate.",

      "In a statement late Friday, the IDF said it had \u201claunched extensive attacks and mobilized forces to seize strategic areas in the Gaza Strip, as part of the opening moves of Operation Gideon\u2019s Chariots and the expansion of the campaign in Gaza.\u201d",
      "The statement described the latest offensive as a renewed effort to release hostages and defeat Hamas. It comes after Israel\u2019s security Cabinet unanimously approved plans earlier in May to seize all of the Gaza Strip."

      "Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip have killed more than 100 people in the last 24 hours and injured hundreds more, according to the Health Ministry, as President Donald Trump tours the Middle East with few remarks on Israel's intensifying war on the enclave.",
      "The United States would no longer give \"lectures on how to live\" to the Middle East, Trump said, as he focused instead on speeches about American glory, luxury jets and handshakes with billionaires.",
      "Trump wrapped up his four-day tour of the region Friday, which included stops in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, but not Israel, skirting attention on ceasefire negotiations or the lifting of Israel's total blockade on aid entering Gaza.",
      "Since March 2, Israel has blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid, medicine or commercial goods into Gaza, which Israeli officials say is intended to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages. United Nations officials have accused Israel of using \u201cstarvation a bargaining chip.\u201d",
      "The aerial offensive is raising fears of another ground invasion, after Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu said\u00a0earlier this month that he would order the military to ramp up its operations\u00a0and seize the entire strip.",
      "One of those Israeli missiles landed on the home of 11-year-old Ibrahim Al-Banna in southern Gaza on Thursday evening. Ibrahim's uncle Abd Al-Banna arrived at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, carrying his dead body wrapped in a green blanket. The boy's mother broke down into tears, seeing her son's body on a gurney, a NBC News crew witnessed.",
      "\u201cMy darling, my Abdu \u2026 you are my heart \u2026 I wish it were me instead of you,\u201d she said, crying and embracing his lifeless body.",
      "As his family wrapped Ibrahim's body into a white funeral shroud at the morgue, his uncle leaned into him and said, \"When you meet God, tell him they left Gaza alone \u2014 without food, without water, without hope.\u201d",
      "Aside from broadly declining to discuss human rights issues with Middle Eastern officials, as previous U.S. leaders have done, Trump's public statements on Gaza has been limited to saying he wanted to make Gaza a \u201cfreedom zone.\u201d He did not elaborate on details of such a proposal, but said Friday, \u201cWe're looking at Gaza. And we're going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Netanyahu has been strained in the weeks ahead of his trip as they grow apart on two of the region's most pressing issues: the war in Gaza and aggression from Iran, U.S. and Middle Eastern officials with the knowledge of the tensions told NBC News.",
      "Despite an alignment on display in the early days of Trump's administration, in which he encouraged the Israeli military to \u201cfinish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza and restarted supplying weapons to Israel that then-President Joe Biden had paused, Trump has since become frustrated with the staunch U.S. ally, including Netanyahu\u2019s decision to intensify the military offensive on the enclave.",
      "In turn, Netanyahu is said to be frustrated with Trump\u2019s refusal to support military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, opting instead to negotiate with Iran, and for stepping back from U.S. strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.",
      "Israel's intensified strikes on Gaza were paired with ongoing violence in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces have ramped up their raids and settler violence has soared.",
      "The Israeli military killed five members of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad on Thursday, the group's military wing said after Israeli forces surrounded their homes in a West Bank town. The raid was in response to a gunman opening fire on a vehicle carrying Tzeela Gez, a pregnant 30-year-old Israeli woman who was being driven to the hospital. Gez died while giving birth, though her baby survived.",
      "Netanyahu said he was \u201cdeeply shocked by the horrific attack.\u201d Hamas praised it as \"heroic.\"",
      "Palestinian health officials say more than 53,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terror attacks\u00a0on Israel killed about about 1,200 people with about 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials."

    "story": [
      "The streets of Syria were a carnival of car horns, fireworks and flags after President Donald Trump made the surprise announcement that the United States would lift sanctions that have throttled the country\u2019s economy for more than 45 years.",
      "Trump stunned even close observers on Tuesday by saying he wants to normalize relations after Syria\u2019s longtime president, Bashar al Assad, was toppled in December. Trump met Wednesday with Assad\u2019s successor, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former leader of an al-Qaeda offshoot group, in Saudi Arabia\u00a0after urging him\u00a0late Tuesday to \u201cshow us something special.\u201d",
      "That has delighted Syrians and campaigners, who have been calling for sanctions relief to rebuild the war-ruined country \u2014 a reconstruction priced up to $400 billion. When Trump made the announcement \u2014 telling a Saudi audience \u201cwe\u2019re taking them all off\u201d \u2014 Syrian housewife Dalal Qallab took to\u00a0the streets with her children in an outpouring of joy.",
      "\u201cTrump said that he will give us a chance, and we deserve that chance,\u201d Qallab, a mother of four from the port city of Latakia, told NBC News. \u201cAfter 14 years, I felt that the American president cared about us,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was a historic moment. It gave us hope for a better life.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a chance at relief after a grim 14 years in a country that until now has been one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned.",
      "\u201cFor years, sanctions have caused severe damage to the Syrian economy, directly impacting citizens\u2019 lives and hindering development and production,\u201d said Syrian economy minister spokesperson Hassan Al-Ahmad in a statement sent to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis decision presents a genuine opportunity to revive the economy, restore national production cycles, and open doors to investments, technology, and markets,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom the Syrian government\u2019s perspective, this decision marks a turning point that we aim to leverage wisely and rationally.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere have been very few positive things happening in Syria,\u201d said  Aron Lund, a Syria expert and a fellow at Century International, a progressive think tank based in New York. \u201cAssad going was, of course, positive in the sense that you got rid of this mass murderer,\u201d but the \u201ceconomic morass\u201d has persisted.",
      "Assad\u2019s 2011 crackdown morphed into one of the most devastating and complex civil wars of modern times. Iran, Russia and Hezbollah lined up behind Assad, and the U.S., Turkey and others supported different rebel groups. Amid all of that, the Islamic State terroist organization thrived.",
      "Assad stayed in power by killing his own people, deploying chemical weapons and Russian bombs, and torturing and murdering them in an underground network of gulags. The U.N. estimates more than 300,000 people were killed; another 13 million were forced to flee their homes.",
      "In recent years, however, most international aid has flown into places like Ukraine and Gaza. Now it will be far easier for cash to enter Syria, Lund said. He called Trump\u2019s move \u201ca big, good thing for Syria\u2019s chances of recovering and stabilizing as a functioning nation state.\u201d",
      "Such a development would be welcomed by Syria\u2019s neighbors in the Gulf and Middle East. And indeed, Trump said his decision to lift sanctions came at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. They want to see a stable Syria, one that does not disseminate refugees, instability and terrorism, and acts as an ally against Iran.",
      "\u201cI hope to see Syria like the UAE, Qatar or Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Nasser Eido, 49, a lawyer who fled to Norway during the war but has since returned to Damascus since Assad fell. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can achieve this. The old regime stole the country\u2019s resources, kept the people poor and left them hungry.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s move does not come without risk, however.",
      "Questions still hang over al-Sharaa, who led Assad\u2019s overthrow and says he has reformed since his days as the leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which spearheaded the offensive against Assad in early December.",
      "He has given some moderate signals, appointing women and minorities to government positions and saying Sharia, the strict interpretation of Islamic law, will not be imposed. Yet some groups remain uneasy about their place in the new Syria, where there have already been mass killings of Alawites, Assad\u2019s minority Muslim sect.",
      "\u201cThere is the risk that the Syrian government, which is pretty hardcore Islamist, ends up doing horrible things: more massacres, or Christians getting killed, or something else that would not play well in Washington,\u201d Lund said. The White House could be in the position of having to defend itself \u201cagainst the charges that it maybe enabled that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk free decision.\u201d",
      "In 1979, the country was blacklisted on the State Department\u2019s first list of state sponsors of terror, alongside Iraq, Libya and former South Yemen. Today, Syria is the only one left, the others being replaced by North Korea, Cuba and Iran. This classification imposes financial restrictions, as well as banning any American military-related imports or exports.",
      "More U.S. sanctions came in 2004, followed by the first measures from the United Nations and European Union a year later. In 2011, when Assad began brutally suppressing demonstrations, the U.S., U.N. and E.U. imposed further import and export controls.",
      "After rebels toppled Assad in just 11 days with little fightback, the U.S. eased some of these restrictions, granting a six-month license that allowed humanitarian aid to enter the country.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration had shown few signs of offering easy progress. It demanded that Syria fulfill a list of conditions that included protecting minorities before any sanctions could be shifted \u2014 hence the surprise at Trump's announcement.",
      "It could be a game changer for millions.",
      "Jumana Hayek, 23, risked imprisonment and torture for receiving 100 euros (around $115) every month from her brother, who had fled to Germany.",
      "\u201cIt was hard and dangerous because sending money to Syria wasn\u2019t allowed due to American and international sanctions,\u201d said Hayek, a university student from Aleppo studying electrical engineering. \u201cMy brother took risks sending the money, and we took risks receiving it,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cWe suffered a lot, but things will change now.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has talked of his home country having \u201cracist ownership laws\u201d in a genocidal effort against white farmers.",
      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",
      "As for the farmers in South Africa as a whole, Sihlobo, the economist from the Agricultural Business Chamber, pointed at how the country's earnings from exporting produce have grown from $2 billion in the year 2000 to nearly $14 billion in 2024.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re self-sufficient,\u201d Sihlobo said. \u201cThat speaks to the progress the sector has been making. You can\u2019t see numbers like that where there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d",
      "Jaco Minnaar, the chairman of AGRI SA, the largest agriculture organization in South Africa, says the larger problem is South Africa\u2019s crime rate.",
      "\u201cWe can see that farm murders in South Africa have a slightly higher rate per capita than murders in general, but it\u2019s farmers and farmworkers, which is not all necessarily white,\u201d Minnaar said.",
      "\u201cOur murder rate is one of the highest per capita in the world, even higher than some of the war-torn countries. That\u2019s something that we need to address,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t specifically see from the statistics that white people or any other demographic group are targeted.

    "summary": "Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday\u2019s grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest, the world\u2019s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israel and Switzerland to come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour.",
    "story": [
      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday\u2019s grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest, the world\u2019s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israel and Switzerland to come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour.",
      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",
      "Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results.",
      "Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year\u2019s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points.",
      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Raphael\u2019s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points.",
      "There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public.",
      "Sweden\u2019s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ\u2019s \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act\u2019s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels \u2014 a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday.",
      "The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties.",
      "Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956 as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries. This year, there were 37 nations taking part, whittled down to 26 finalists over two semifinals earlier this week. And the production is now a behemoth, with hundreds of crew members and 22 cameras capturing the action.",
      "The first act to perform was Kyle Alessandro, a 19-year-old from Norway, who took the stage wearing chain mail for a pyrotechnic-enhanced rendition of his entry, \u201cLighter.\u201d",
      "His song kicked off a show that included a number of memorable performances, including that of Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman, whose sexually charged \u201cIch Komme\u201d ends with her suspended in the air atop a giant microphone stand emitting sparks.",
      "Poland\u2019s Justyna Steczkowska made her return to Eurovision after 30 years with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-inspired performance that saw the 52-year-old lifted into the air by ropes as a CGI dragon swooped behind her on an 8,000-square-foot LED video wall.",
      "Some 163 million people watched the Eurovision final and the two semifinals last year. Final viewing figures are not yet available for this year\u2019s competition, but it is sure to remain one of the most-watched events in the world. It attracts more viewers than the Super Bowl, which had 123.4 million viewers last year, according to CBS.",
      "That viewership will likely see \"Wasted Love\" climb the charts across Europe. For some Eurovision winners like Dion and ABBA, international stardom awaits.",
      "Most artists aren\u2019t quite that lucky, but the massive platform means winners can see levels of fame they would otherwise only dream of.",
      "Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after winning the 2021 contest, and Dutch singer Duncan Laurence performed his winning 2019 song \u201cArcade\u201d on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show when it started climbing U.S. charts after going viral on TikTok.",
      "For the 25 artists who didn\u2019t win, there\u2019s still the hope that they\u2019ll have found new fans.",
      "Holly-Anne Hull, a member of this year\u2019s British act, Remember Monday, told NBC News in a Zoom interview last month that for her group, the outcome is secondary to the opportunity to be able to perform together on the world stage.",
      "\u201cWe aren\u2019t even doing it for the live show. We\u2019re doing it for the fact that we can live in this band every single day up until that moment,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we\u2019ve ever dreamed of is doing this band full time.\u201d"

Oleh Hryhorov and Ukraine\u2019s national police. The Associated Press couldn\u2019t independently verify the report. There was no comment from Moscow.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the attack as \u201cdeliberate killing of civilians,\u201d adding in a post on Telegram messaging app that \u201cRussians could scarcely not realize what kind of vehicle they were hitting.\u201d",

      "A town in mourning",
      "In Bilopillia, a period of mourning was declared through Monday. Local community chief Yurii Zarko called the day \u201cBlack Saturday.\u201d The injured were taken to a hospital in Sumy, the regional capital.",
      "The local media outlet Suspilne said the passengers on the bus were being evacuated from the town when the strike happened. Authorities are working to identify some of the victims, most of them elderly women.",
      "Russia\u2019s defense ministry claimed its forces hit a military staging area in the Sumy region on Saturday morning, some 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of Bilopillia, without mentioning any other attacks there.",
      "According to a Washington-based think tank, Ukrainian forces have been inching forward into Russian territory in the Kursk region, just north of Bilopillia. The Institute for the Study of War said last week Ukrainian troops had advanced south of the Russian border village of Tyotkino.",
      "Russia\u00a0said last month that its forces had fully reclaimed the Kursk region, nearly nine months after a\u00a0lightning incursion by Kyiv\u00a0captured more than 100 settlements there and promised to hand Ukraine a bargaining chip in possible negotiations with the Kremlin. Ukrainian officials claimed fighting in Kursk is ongoing.",
      "Russian shelling, drones and airstrikes killed at least five other civilians on Friday and overnight across Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kherson regions, according to local officials there.",
      "Russian forces overnight also launched 62 drones, Ukraine\u2019s air force reported. It said 36 of the drones were shot down and six more veered off course, likely due to electronic jamming.",
      "Impact on peace efforts?",
      "Russian and Ukrainian officials met Friday in Istanbul in an attempt to reach a temporary ceasefire, but the talks ended after less than two hours without a breakthrough. It was the first face-to-face dialogue between the two sides since the early weeks of\u00a0Moscow\u2019s February 2022 full-scale invasion\u00a0of Ukraine.",
      "Hopes for a breakthrough were dashed after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0spurned Zelenskyy\u2019s offer\u00a0to meet face-to-face in Turkey. Putin\u2019s no-show came days after he himself proposed negotiations in Istanbul \u201cwithout preconditions,\u201d as an alternative to the \u201cfull and unconditional\u201d ceasefire urged by Ukraine and its Western allies, including the U.S.",
      "While both sides agreed on a large prisoner swap, they remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting.",
      "One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement. The Kremlin has pushed back against such a truce, which remains elusive.",
      "Zelenskyy said he had discussed the outcome of the Istanbul talks with U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of France, Germany, Britain and Poland. In a post on X from a\u00a0European leadership meeting in Albania\u00a0on Friday, he urged \u201ctough sanctions\u201d against Moscow if it rejects \u201ca full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings.\u201d",
      "Kyiv and Moscow agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, according to the heads of both delegations, in what would be their\u00a0biggest such swap. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said on Ukrainian TV on Saturday the exchange could happen as early as next week.",

      "Meanwhile, Israel routinely has threatened to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities if it feels threatened, further complicating tensions in the Mideast already spiked by\u00a0the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "In his first reaction to Trump\u2019s regional visit, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Trump wasn\u2019t truthful when he made claims about creating peace through power.",

      "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 President Donald Trump is returning to Washington on Friday after a diplomatic tour of the Middle East, where he pitched American business and secured investment pledges but failed to reach long-promised peace deals in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "Marked by high-level talks and lavish displays of regional hospitality, the trip showcased Trump\u2019s self-styled role as a dealmaker and peacemaker. Still, his loftiest targets \u2014 resolving the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine \u2014 remain elusive.",
      "In Abu Dhabi, Trump capped his weeklong tour with a visit to Qasr Al Watan, the emirate\u2019s presidential palace, where he toured exhibits showcasing investments in energy, health care and aviation. Accompanied by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the president met with business leaders and took shots at his predecessor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thinking, we have a president of the United States doing the selling,\u201d Trump said, taking a swipe at former President Joe Biden. \u201cYou think Biden would be doing this? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d A large screen at the event repurposed his campaign slogan to proclaim \u201cMaking Energy Great Again,\u201d a nod to the economic focus of the trip.",
      "Throughout the week, Trump announced major investments by Middle Eastern nations in American businesses, including a $600 billion investment deal from Saudi Arabia and an agreement with Qatar Airways to buy hundreds of planes from Boeing and GE Aerospace.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields lauded the trip as an \"incredibly formative visit that forged America\u2019s Golden Age through its partnerships with a critical region of the world.\"",
      "The visit came amid controversy over Trump's eagerness to accept a planned gift from the Qatari government: a $400 million luxury plane which he hopes to use as Air Force One. The offer has drawn backlash from Democrats and some Republicans back home over potential ethical, security and financial challenges.",
      "Trump repeatedly dismissed concerns about the plane, saying he \"thought it was a great gesture.\" He also brushed off accusations that the trip, which came as his namesake company expands into the Middle East, created a potential conflict of interest.",
      "Yet, even as he celebrated his economic victories, the president faced the reality upon departure of the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine, conflicts he has vowed to resolve.",
      "The president has made ending some of the world\u2019s thorniest conflicts a top priority of his administration, vowing to stop the bloodshed and bring about a lasting peace. And in a show of strong commitment, he has dispatched top aides to the cause, with special envoy Steve Witkoff hopscotching the globe in pursuit of the president\u2019s goal.\u00a0Before departing Washington, Trump announced the release of Edan Alexander, an American held by Hamas, with Qatar playing a central role in the negotiations.",
      "However, the president acknowledged that significant challenges remain. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Gaza,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he left Abu Dhabi. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.\u201d",
      "As Trump concluded his trip Friday, Israeli airstrikes had killed more than 100 people in the last 24 hours, according to local health authorities.",
      "On Friday, asked about future opportunities for face-to-face diplomacy between himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump responded: \u201cWe have to meet. He and I will meet. I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Trump had expressed disappointment but not surprise when Putin failed to attend a planned meeting in Turkey. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for him to go if I didn\u2019t go,\u201d Trump said, noting that his schedule had made the trip untenable.",
      "Instead, he teased the near possibility of a breakthrough in nuclear talks with Iran. Trump told reporters Friday that his administration had submitted a proposal for a deal with Tehran, after describing earlier their efforts \u201cin very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace.\u201d Earlier in the week, Trump hinted that he hoped an agreement was near, stating that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.\u201d",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said later Friday that his government had not \"received any written proposal from the United States\" and that there was \"no scenario\" in which Tehran would abandon its nuclear program to reach a deal with the U.S.",
      "\"Iran nonetheless remains determined and straightforward: Respect our rights and terminate your sanctions, and we have a deal,\" he said on X. \"Mark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] signatories, too.\"",
      "Trump also said Friday that recognizing the new Syrian government \u2014 and lifting what he called \"brutal\" and \"biting\" sanctions \u2014 was \"the right thing to do\" as the new leadership cements its control.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that the trip did not sideline Benjamin Netanyahu by forgoing a visit with the Israeli prime minister, explaining that his relationships with Arab leaders are \u201cvery good for Israel.\u201d He also said he reached out to Netanyahu on the decision to lift sanctions on Syria.",
      "Analysts see parallels between this trip and Trump\u2019s 2017 Middle East tour.",
      "\u201cThe key thing to watch is what comes next in the region and what big steps his administration takes,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. After 2017, the Gulf region saw a rift that isolated Qatar for three years and a U.S. \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran that he said failed to deliver lasting results. Yet, the trip also laid the groundwork for the Abraham Accords, the 2020 agreement normalizing ties between Israel and several Arab states, which remains Trump\u2019s signature foreign policy achievement and which Biden sought to continue.",
      "Trump is aiming higher. \u201cThis time around, Trump is looking for a historic breakthrough with Iran on the nuclear talks and also dreams of getting a Nobel Prize if he gets that Iran deal or expands the Abraham Accords to include a Saudi-Israeli normalization accord,\u201d Katulis said.",
      "Trump\u2019s hosts this week have also played important roles in these efforts, helping to mediate the conflicts and offering support to negotiations, and the president acknowledged there was more to do as he departed Abu Dhabi.",
      "\u201cUnexpected surprises and events have a way of knocking U.S. administrations off balance,\u201d Katulis said. \u201cThe ongoing war in Gaza and the growing misery of Palestinians living there will be a critical test.\u201d"

      "\u201cIn the short term, [Temu and Shein] are definitely going to increase their shipment volume to the U.S.,\u201d said Anand Kumar, associate director of research at Coresight Research, adding that it will also help the companies reassess their long-term strategy.",
      "According to Jason Wong, who has been associated with Temu's product logistics in Hong Kong, the company has paused shipments from China after the end of the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption and relied on U.S. stockpiles to fulfill orders.",
      "Under the latest tariff policy, Wong anticipates that bulk shipments subject to the 30% tariff rate will resume to the U.S., replenishing these stockpiles.",
      "\u203330% is still high, but compared to 125%, 30% is basically nothing,\u201d he added.",
      "Small values, higher levies",
      "The tariffs situation nevertheless remains more complicated for small-value packages under \u201cde minimis.\u201d",
      "The\u00a0latest policy update\u00a0retains a $100 flat fee per postal item, while scrapping a previously planned increase to $200 starting in June, according to an\u00a0executive order released by the White House\u00a0on Monday.",
      "According to Wong, for Temu to resume its small-value shipments from China to the U.S., the tariffs still need to be relaxed further \u2014 something he expects will happen eventually.",
      "Shein has not said that it is ending direct shipments from China. However, it says on its platform that \u201ctariffs are included in the price you pay.\u201d",
      "The reduction in tariffs on low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China could therefore result in the easing of some prices, said Coresight\u2019s Kumar.",
      "In anticipation of changes to the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, Shein has also expanded its supply chains, building manufacturing operations in countries such as\u00a0Turkey, Mexico and Brazil. It also reportedly plans to shift production to Vietnam.",
      "Shein and Temu did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.",
      "On May 2, Trump ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption policy, which analysts had criticized as hurting local businesses and disguising illicit fentanyl trade.",
      "The small-package tariff exemption had helped Temu and Shein maintain budget prices on the merchandise they shipped directly from China.",
      "The U.S. government had briefly suspended the exemption in February before reinstating the provision days later, as customs officials struggled to process and collect tariffs on a spate of low-value packages.",
      "U.S. rivals like Amazon, on whose platform many third-party sellers offload products sourced or assembled by Chinese manufacturers, are also expected to ramp up shipments during the 90-day window, trade experts said.",
      "\u201cAll the companies are just going to scramble to get everything they can into the country as quickly as they can,\u201d said\u00a0Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consultancy firm Tidalwave Solutions. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in the same boat.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Fans from around the world have descended upon the 69th Eurovision Song Contest to rally behind performers from their home countries who have been battling it out onstage all week.",
      "In total, there are 26 performances in the grand final: the countries that got through the semifinals, plus the host country (this year, Switzerland) and a group called the Big Five \u2014 France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom \u2014 which enter the final automatically because their countries make the biggest financial contributions to Eurovision.",
      "As the artists gear up for an extravagant, glitter-dusted pop song contest featuring their wildly over-the-top performances, thousands of spectators gather at Eurovision Village, a convention center that\u2019s been turned into a hub for fans. Some drape national flags on their backs, others paint the flags on their faces. Many find themselves dancing until the early hours at the EuroClub, which plays nothing but Eurovision hits.",
      "The event is what members of the Remember Monday group representing the U.K. called a cultural phenomenon, likening it to the Super Bowl in the U.S.",
      "\u201cEveryone knows what it is,\u201d Holly-Anne Hull said. \u201cAnd everyone, whether they like it or not, is aware of who\u2019s won it every year.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what else to know.",
      "How to watch and vote",
      "Performers will battle it out during Saturday\u2019s grand final, which airs at 3 p.m. ET on Peacock for viewers in the U.S.",
      "The winner of the contest is decided by a mix of votes from national juries of music professionals and viewers watching at home. People all around the world can vote for the winner using the contest\u2019s app or online.",
      "Who are this year\u2019s favorites?",
      "Gambling on Eurovision is big business, and sports betting firms \u2014 who give their two cents on the odds of each contender \u2014 have a decent track record of identifying which songs will do well at Saturday\u2019s grand final.",
      "This year, the favorites include Sweden, which has won the contest seven times since the first Eurovision in 1956. The group KAJ, a trio of Swedish-speaking Finns, is entering this year with \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d an ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The song, which features staging re-creating a sauna complete with dancers in towels, is the most-streamed song by far from this year\u2019s contest, according to Spotify.",
      "Another top contender is Austria. Singer JJ, an opera singer, uses extraordinary vocal range to hit high notes throughout his song, \u201cWasted Love.\u201d",
      "The Dutch entry is also considered a front-runner. Singer Claude\u2019s \u201cC\u2019est La Vie\u201d has a mixture of French and English lyrics, and it\u2019s this year\u2019s third most-streamed song of the nominees on Spotify.",
      "Other eye-catching numbers to watch for",
      "Eurovision songs cut across genres, and while many wouldn\u2019t be out of place on a Top 40 radio playlist, sometimes they stand out for wild lyrics or eye-popping staging.",
      "In addition to the Swedish sauna song, this year\u2019s entries include Icelandic act V\u00e6b. The blond brothers don oversized silver outfits and jewel-encrusted sunglasses and energetically jump around the stage during their song \u201cR\u00f3a,\u201d which is about rowing a boat.",
      "Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman singing about a \u201clust trance\u201d while wearing thigh-high leather boots in \u201cIch Komme.\u201d The song reaches its climax with Vikman on a giant microphone stand suspended in the air with sparks flying out of it.",
      "Being weird doesn't guarantee a spot in the final, though. This year's Irish entry was a dance anthem imagining a world in which Laika, the Soviet dog who died after being sent to space, not only lived but \u201chas a party in the air\u201d and \u201cis dancing every night among the stars.\u201d It didn't make it past Thursday's semifinal.",
      "Have there been any controversies?",
      "As was the case last year, Israel\u2019s participation has drawn protests over the country\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip. This year\u2019s contestant, Yuval Raphael, survived the Hamas-led terror attack on the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) bars lyrics it views as political and last year forced Israel\u2019s entry to change lyrics that referenced the attacks.",
      "Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said in a statement that the EBU, which organizes the contest, \u201cis not immune to global events but, together with our Members, it is our role to ensure the Contest remains \u2014 at its heart \u2014 a universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is not our role to make comparisons between conflicts,\u201d he added, noting that the EBU \u201cremains aligned with other international organizations that have similarly maintained their inclusive stance towards Israeli participants in major competitions at this time.\u201d",
      "The entry from Malta also prompted controversy for its lyrics to Miriana Conte\u2019s song, \u201cServing.\u201d The original version featured the Maltese word for \u201csinging,\u201d which sounds like a vulgar word in English. That word has been omitted in the reworked version. The singer posted on her Instagram that the EBU had made her change the words.",
      "In a statement to Sky News, NBC's British partner, at the time, the EBU said that \"if a song is deemed unacceptable for any reason, broadcasters are given the opportunity to modify it, or select a new one, before the deadline as per the rules of the Contest.\"",
      "The Italian consumer group Codacons also filed a complaint over offensive stereotypes in Estonian Tommy Cash\u2019s \u201cEspresso Macchiato,\u201d which includes lyrics that reference \u201csweating like a mafioso\u201d and being \u201caddicted to tobacco.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Eurovision did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Estonia\u2019s entry.",
      "A major surprise appearance could be in store",
      "A question on many people\u2019s minds is whether C\u00e9line Dion \u2014 yes the C\u00e9line Dion \u2014 will make an appearance.",
      "The award-winning artist was 20 years old when she won the competition for Switzerland back in 1988. (Although she is Canadian, artists don\u2019t need to be from the country they represent. For example, this year, the Swedish entry is from Finland and the Irish entry is from Norway.)",
      "Dion appeared in a video at Tuesday\u2019s semifinal saying she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to appear at the contest. The singer has been public about her stiff-person syndrome diagnosis and gave an emotional performance at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Paris last year.",
      "Asked via email by NBC News about the possibility of Dion appearing in person at Saturday\u2019s final, Eurovision spokesperson Sibylle Tornay said, \u201cThere are currently no changes regarding C\u00e9line Dion \u2014 we are still in close contact with her, of course her health is the most important thing and comes first.\u201d"

      "Despite the flurry of activity from Russian, Ukrainian, American, British, French and German diplomats, the negotiations lasted barely two hours and did not appear to bring the sides closer together. There was one point of agreement \u2014 a deal to swap 1,000 prisoners each, the head of Russia\u2019s delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said. It would be the largest swap since the start of the war.",
      "With Russia still issuing demands that resemble an outright Ukrainian surrender, some observers see these talks as largely an attempt by both Moscow and Kyiv to pursuade President Donald Trump they are not the obstacle to peace.",
      "Before they even began, President Donald Trump predicted there would be no progress unless he and Russian President Vladimir Putin were involved.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe anything\u2019s going to happen whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,\u201d Trump said of his Russian counterpart while speaking with journalists late Thursday aboard Air Force One en route to Abu Dhabi. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.\u201d",
      "Trump said Thursday he wanted to meet with his Kremlin counterpart \u201cas soon as we can set it up.\u201d Asked what stood in the way, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that \u201csuch a meeting is certainly necessary\u201d but that first there must be \u201cexpert negotiations, consultations and long, intense preparation.\u201d",

      "The lopsided face-off saw Secretary of State Marco Rubio arriving at the palace despite a no-show from his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

      "Today, the gulf between the two sides' demands remains as wide as the Bosporus that cleaves Istanbul in two.",
      "Russian officials say they see the talks as a chance to restart what they call \u201cpeace negotiations.\u201d In reality, their conditions for peace \u2014 halting the war Russia started by invading Ukraine in February  2022 \u2014 are tantamount to a Ukrainian surrender. Kyiv has said it will never accept these terms, which include agreeing never to join NATO and agreeing to permanent \u201cneutrality\u201d between Moscow and the West.",
      "NBC News asked the Russian team Thursday whether Putin is prepared to compromise \u2014 there was no answer.",
      "Ukraine instead wants a 30-ceasefire as a basis on which to build future diplomatic wins. Its European supporters say that they will hit Russia with further sanctions if it does not agree. Though often accused of being far softer on Russia than on Ukraine, Trump has also suggested he could hit Putin with sanctions if he feels not enough progress is being made.",
      "The talks in Istanbul are shrouded in \u201csmoke and mirrors,\u201d said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank.",
      "\u201cThese are not negotiations between two sides willing to explore a real ceasefire,\u201d he said. Rather, the parties \u201care trying to capture the public narrative of who is the obstacle to these discussions \u2014 and to avoid the wrath and anger of President Trump.\u201d",
      "Eyal likens the negotiations to \u201ca game of musical chairs \u2014 when the music stops, who remains standing?\u201d That is to say: \u201cWhen Mr. Trump finally loses patience, who does he blame for failing to achieve a ceasefire? That\u2019s the whole game.\u201d",

      "DOHA, Qatar \u2014 President Donald Trump\u00a0brushed off\u00a0questions Wednesday\u00a0over ethical concerns about the\u00a0growing\u00a0Middle East\u00a0footprint of his\u00a0family business, as his\u00a0trip in the region\u00a0takes him to three countries with Trump-branded ventures.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he didn\u2019t know how an Emirati-backed firm had struck a deal with the Trump family company\u2019s digital coin for $2 billion.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Trump said, adding that he is a big cryptocurrency fan and if the U.S. doesn\u2019t lead in crypto and AI, China will. Zach Witkoff, a co-founder of the World Liberty Financial crypto venture and the son of the president\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, announced the investment at a conference in Dubai earlier this month.",
      "Asked if the Saudi-financed and Trump-linked LIV Golf tour came up during his conversations with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the last two days, Trump said it had not. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss that,\u201d he added. He also sidestepped Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s threat to block his nominees until there are more answers on a high-priced jet that Qatar has offered as a gift and instead mused that there was \u201cjust something wrong\u201d with Schumer, a New York Democrat.",
      "The Trump Organization, led by the president\u2019s two oldest sons, has also significantly expanded its Middle East footprint, with new ventures in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. These include a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a golf resort in Doha with Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund\u2019s real estate arm,\u00a0a Trump Tower in Jeddah, and a hotel under construction in Muscat. The projects are partnered with Dar Global, a developer linked to the Saudi government. It's unclear how long the projects will take to complete.",
      "The Trump-branded projects have drawn scrutiny in Washington from the president's political opponents and even some allies, who point out that the president has not divested from the Trump Organization and continues to profit from \u2014 and personally promote \u2014 these business ventures in his second term. The company has said that Trump handed over management of his assets to his family before returning to office and has no day-to-day role.",
      "\"The Trump Organization developments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates raise serious conflict of interest questions, as President\u00a0Trump meets with top officials of all three countries this week,\u201d said Meghan Faulkner, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group and watchdog focused on issues of public integrity and affiliated with Democrats. \u201cThe American people should not have to wonder if Donald Trump is prioritizing their interests or his own bottom line while he is making foreign policy decisions, but his business ties make that an unavoidable question.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that, \"Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump\u2019s Administration is committed to full transparency.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s affinity for the Middle East is well known, with the president finding fertile ground in the region as he works to carve out an image as a global peacemaker and the leader of a country that is open for business. On Tuesday in Riyadh, he announced plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria and offered Iran \u201ca new, hopeful path\u201d toward a better future.",
      "During a state visit with Qatar\u2019s emir on Wednesday, Trump praised the warming Qatar-Saudi Arabia relationship, lavishing flattery on his host. \u201cWe just came from Saudi Arabia, where we have another great man over there that's a friend of yours,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys get along so well and like each other. You sort of remind me a little bit of each other, if you want to know the truth. They're both tall, handsome guys who happen to be very smart.\u201d",
      "This marks a shift from his first term, when a Saudi-led coalition blockaded Qatar over alleged terrorism support.",
      "And Trump has defended as \u201ca great gesture\u201d the Qatari jet gift, saying before leaving Washington that turning it down would be foolish. \u201cI could be a stupid person and say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want a free, very expensive airplane,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding that it would go to his presidential library foundation once he leaves office. Qatar, however, appeared to temper the announcement. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar\u2019s media attach\u00e9 to the U.S., clarified that the transfer is \u201cunder consideration\u201d by Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, with no final decision having been made.",
      "Democrats in Washington are capitalizing on the controversy, with the Democratic National Committee announcing plans to fly a banner that reads \u201cQatar-a-Lago\u201d over Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club on Wednesday.\u00a0Some Republican allies of the president have also raised concerns about the jet: Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson called the gift a \"very odd offer,\" and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the plane could bring \"significant espionage and surveillance problems.\"",
      "At a news conference Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., dismissed concerns about the Trump family\u2019s foreign business dealings, claiming he did not have expertise on the matter and stressing that Trump has been transparent.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has nothing to hide,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s very upfront.\u201d He stressed that ethics oversight is in place and emphasized that his focus is on leading the House. And he said Qatar\u2019s gift of the plane was \u201cto the country,\u201d not Trump personally.",
      "Refitting the plane could cost $1 billion and take years to complete, more than twice the plane\u2019s reported value, NBC News reported. The cost, likely to come at taxpayers\u2019 expense, raises questions about the practical implications of a gift to a president who may no longer be in office at the time it's ready to use."

      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 As tourists crossed Basel\u2019s Mittlere Br\u00fccke bridge Thursday, some of them paused to savor the warm spring sun just as they have done for centuries. This week, the crossing that straddles the Rhine river as it meanders across the borders with nearby France and Germany was lined with flags bearing the Eurovision Song Contest slogan, \u201cUnited by Music.\u201d",
      "Basel, and Europe at large, are anything but united.",
      "Police and the the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) are preparing themselves for a potential repeat of last year\u2019s iteration of Eurovision, the song competition that launched the careers of ABBA and 1988 winner Celine Dion. The 2024 contest was overshadowed by politics perhaps more than in any previous year, with fierce protests over the participation of Israel amid its government\u2019s intensifying war on Gaza.",
      "It\u2019s purely by chance that this year\u2019s contest, usually an outrageous jamboree of inscrutable lyrics and scantily clad backing dancers, is being held in a country with a long-standing policy of neutrality. Each year\u2019s venue is dictated by which country won the previous year.",
      "The EBU, which organizes the contest, says the event is nonpolitical, but given that it brings together dozens of countries \u2014 this year, 37 nations will take part \u2014 the divisions and flashpoints present on the world stage inevitably creep in among the pyrotechnic reveling.",
      "The political divide over Israel\u2019s participation in Basel has already tested the EBU\u2019s impartiality.",
      "Israel shattered a fragile two-month ceasefire earlier this year, as its military intensifies its bombardment of the Gaza Strip and enforces a total blockade of food, medicine and goods from entering the enclave, where more than 50,000 people have been killed, according to Gaza health officials.",
      "The war began following the Hamas-led terror attacks on several sites in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed around 1,200 people. One of those sites was the Nova music festival, where around 360 people were killed.",
      "The singer representing Israel, which first took part in the contest in 1973, is Yuval Raphael \u2014 one of the survivors of that attack.",
      "Last year, Raphael spoke to the United Nations Human Rights Council, describing how she sought refuge in a bomb shelter with other festivalgoers, hiding for eight hours under dead bodies. She told the U.N., \u201cthe physical injuries I sustained are healing, but the mental scars will stay with me forever.\u201d",
      "The EBU bars lyrics it views as political and last year forced Israel\u2019s entry to change lyrics that referenced the Oct. 7 attacks.",
      "While the lyrics of this year\u2019s song, \u201cNew Day Will Rise,\u201d don\u2019t make reference to any events in particular, Galia Press-Barnathan, a professor of international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says the message is nevertheless clear."
