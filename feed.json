      "Lee Soo Man spent three decades trying to bring K-pop into the global market, often bending but never breaking his vision",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Lee Soo Man resisted the title at first. \u201cKing of K-pop\u201d sounded too brash, too nightclub-esque \u2014 like something you\u2019d see on a neon sign in Itaewon, a nightlife neighborhood in the South Korean capital Seoul once popular with U.S. soldiers and foreign visitors. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Couldn\u2019t it be Father of K-pop?\u2019\u201d the 73-year-old recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He was discussing the title of Amazon Prime's documentary about his career. The producers insisted the bolder moniker would resonate better with American audiences. After some back-and-forth, Lee relented. \u201cI had to follow their decision.\u201d",
      "The compromise speaks to Lee\u2019s pragmatic approach to breaking South Korean acts into the American mainstream \u2014 a three-decade quest that often required him to bend but never break his vision. Now, as the founder of SM Entertainment and widely credited as the architect of K-pop\u2019s global expansion, Lee will be inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame on Saturday alongside basketball legend Yao Ming, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, and rock icon Yoshiki, among others.",
      "Lee remains a prominent but controversial figure in K-pop history. His label pioneered the industry\u2019s intensive training system, recruiting performers as young as elementary school age and putting them through years of rigorous preparation. Some of his artists have challenged their contracts as unfair, sparking broader debates about industry practices.",
      "The recognition arrives as Lee reemerges into the spotlight after a contentious, high-profile departure from the agency he founded in 1995 \u2014 a management battle that included a public feud with his nephew-in-law and a bidding war over his shares. He\u2019s been keeping busy since, debuting a new band, A20 MAY, in both China and the U.S. He's also investing in a boutique Chinese firm\u2019s high-tech production technologies.",
      "Born in South Korea, Lee studied computer engineering in the U.S. for his master's degree. That technical background would later inform his approach to everything from visualization and cutting-edge production technologies \u2014 he said he\u2019s been rewatching \"The Matrix\u201d to revisit filming techniques \u2014 to pioneering elaborate \u201cworldviews\u201d and virtual avatars for his K-pop bands.",
      "For Lee, the Hall of Fame honor \u201cconfirms that K-pop has become a genre that the mainstream is now paying attention to\u201d \u2014 an acceptance that came after costly lessons and years of trial and error.",
      "Lee invested about $5 million in BoA\u2019s 2009 American debut with \u201cEat You Up,\u201d one of the first songs by a South Korean artist to be primarily written and produced by Western producers \u2014 a bold early attempt to bring K-pop into the U.S. mainstream. But with few widely recognized Asian artists in American pop culture at the time, the market wasn\u2019t ready. After nearly two years, BoA \u2014 already a megastar in Korea and Japan \u2014 decided to return home. The experience, Lee has said, left him with lasting regrets.",
      "\u201cWhen I asked the songwriter(s) to revise \u2018Eat You Up,\u2019 they refused,\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cIf we had changed it, I believe it would have achieved much better results.\u201d",
      "That setback taught Lee that K-pop needed to source global talent while maintaining creative control to adapt songs for the worldwide market. His quest for the perfect tracks took him worldwide.",
      "\u201cI once heard a song that was so good I couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d he said, recalling the track that would later become \u201cDreams Come True\u201d for S.E.S., the late-1990s girl group. \u201cI could\u2019ve bought the license to the song in South Korea, Hong Kong, or Sweden. But I wanted to play it safe, so I found the Finnish address, went to meet the songwriter directly, wrote up a contract, and brought it back.\u201d",
      "At the time, top Western songwriters prioritized Japan, the world\u2019s second-largest music market. \u201cEuropean songwriters were willing to sell to Asia,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cThat\u2019s how we eventually built a system where music from Europe, Asia, and America could come together.\u201d",
      "That fusion became K-pop\u2019s signature. Lee also helped to pioneer another innovation: elaborate fictional universes, or \u201cworldviews,\u201d for groups like EXO and aespa \u2014 a storytelling approach that would later be adopted across the industry, including by groups like BTS.",
      "The concept emerged during his time in the U.S., where he witnessed MTV transform music into a visual medium. \u201cBut we only have three or four minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we express dramatic, cinematic elements in such a short time?\u201d",

      "Unable to attract established screenwriters, Lee developed the storylines himself. The strategy proved prescient: These interconnected narratives give global fans reason to follow groups across comebacks, waiting for the next chapter in an unfolding saga.",
      "Despite K-pop\u2019s global success, Lee remains focused on Asia\u2019s potential. He envisions South Korea as a creative hub where international talent learns production. \u201cKorea should become the country of producers,\u201d he said.",
      "With the Asia-Pacific region home to more than half the world\u2019s population, he sees it as entertainment\u2019s inevitable future center.",
      "His latest venture with A20 MAY, which operates in both China and the U.S., is testing that vision in one of Asia\u2019s most challenging markets. China\u2019s entertainment landscape has grown increasingly restrictive, with Beijing recently cracking down on \u201c effeminate \u201d male celebrities and youth culture. Asked about potential political risks, Lee dismissed concerns.",
      "\u201cPolitical risk? I don\u2019t really know much about that,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he aims to elevate South Korea\u2019s cultural influence as a center of production while meeting China\u2019s needs as it seeks to expand its soft power alongside economic dominance.",
      "\u201cCulturally, does China need what we do? I believe they do.\u201d",
      "The documentary also addressed darker aspects of K-pop close to Lee\u2019s heart, including the suicides of SM Entertainment artists.",
      "He traces the problem to anonymous and malicious online comments that often evade accountability, especially when posted on servers outside South Korea\u2019s jurisdiction, calling it a global issue requiring international cooperation. Lee advocates for worldwide standards on user verification and mediation systems where victims could identify attackers without expensive legal battles.",
      "But Lee resists the media\u2019s focus on K-pop\u2019s problems. \u201cShould we always weigh the dark side equally with the bright side, the future?\u201d he asked. \u201cMedia should consider whether K-pop represents more future or more past that holds us back. Rather than just discussing the dark side and dragging us down by clinging to the past, shouldn\u2019t we talk more about the future?\u201d",
      "After more than three decades, Lee\u2019s definition remains straightforward: \u201cK-pop is a new language of communication that transcends barriers. These languages move around naturally \u2014 what you can\u2019t stop is culture.\u201d",

      "As details of Andrew\u2019s links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continued to dribble out and Parliament raised questions about his rent-free residence at a sprawling country house near Windsor Castle, King Charles III moved Thursday to shield the monarchy from any further revelations.",

      "Andrew\u2019s disgrace comes as Charles, who is 76 and undergoing treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer, works to resolve stubborn problems and buttress the foundations of the monarchy for his elder son, Prince William, to inherit.",

    "story": [
      "Florence Welch explores her desire for greatness and the constraints she faces as a female artist in Florence + the Machine's sixth album, \"Everybody Scream.\"",
      "During his acceptance speech for best actor at this year\u2019s Screen Actors Guild Awards, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet made known his desire to be remembered as \u201cone of the greats.\u201d A few years earlier, Chalamet starred in Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in which his character demonstratively asks his future wife, \u201cWhat women are allowed into the club of geniuses, anyway?\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody Scream,\u201d Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth album, is a response to that familiar, gendered notion. Across its 12 tracks, Florence Welch contends with both her desire for greatness and the constraints she understands to have been put on her as a female artist.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Welch had Chalamet\u2019s viral speech in mind when writing, \u201cOne of the Greats,\u201d the album\u2019s lead single. But what is apparent in her brooding feminist treatise are grievances about sexism and male entitlement. \u201cIt must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,\u201d she belts over gothic synths and strings. But it's a bit funny, too: \"Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan, you\u2019re my second favorite frontman.\u201d",
      "Welch collaborated with Mark Bowen of IDLES for much of the record, as well as Mitski and Aaron Dessner of The National. Sometimes the collaborations create a haunting sound, but most of \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is packed with the band's signature orchestral pop, an ornate arrangement of strings, synths, guitars, pianos and percussion.",
      "Perhaps to a fault, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d isn\u2019t sonically dissimilar from what fans of Florence + the Machine have come to expect. But in a lyrical shift, Welch meditates heavily on mysticism and witchcraft throughout, something she turned to after suffering a nearly fatal ectopic pregnancy in 2023. The 39-year-old later revealed that she performed with a burst fallopian tube during her last tour and had to undergo emergency surgery.",
      "\u201cI sit in salt water/Call in a vision of my daughter/Light a candle/Place my grief upon the altar,\u201d her voice vibrates over haunting background vocals and an eerie electric guitar on \u201cYou Can Have It All.\u201d",

      "More than 100 investigators are racing to solve a daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris",
      "PARIS -- More than 100 investigators are racing to piece together how thieves pulled off the brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, working to recover the stolen gems and bring those responsible to justice.",
      "The daytime theft of centuries-old jewels from the world's most-visited museum thought to be of significant cultural and monetary value has captured the world's attention for its audacity and movie plot-like details.",
      "But thus far little has been revealed about how the investigation is unfolding, a source of frustration for those accustomed to the 24-hour flow of information in American true crime or British tabloids.",
      "Suspects, like the jewels themselves, have remained out of sight, the case file cloaked in mystery and French authorities characteristically discreet.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Sunday that more details would come once the suspects\u2019 custody period ends, likely around midweek, depending on the charges. But here's what we know so far about the case:",
      "Authorities said it took mere minutes for thieves to ride a lift up the side of the museum, smash display cases and steal eight objects worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19. The haul included a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense.",
      "Beccuau has not publicly announced what charges the suspects could face, though French media have reported that the charges include criminal conspiracy and organized theft, which can carry hefty fines and yearslong prison sentences.",
      "Beccuau said investigators made several arrests Saturday evening but didn\u2019t name them or say how many. One suspect, she added, was stopped at a Paris airport while trying to leave the country.",
      "In France, where privacy laws are strict, images of criminal suspects are not made public as they often are elsewhere. Suspects aren\u2019t paraded before cameras upon arrest or shown in mugshots.",
      "The presumption of innocence is inscribed in France's constitution and deeply valued throughout society. The French often express shock at the spectacle of criminal trials in the United States, including in 2011 when media outlets photographed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then a candidate in France's presidential election, on a \u201cperp walk\u201d to a New York prison after he was indicted on charges he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. The charges were eventually dismissed.",
      "Information about investigations is meant to be secret under French law, a policy known as \u2033secret d\u2019instruction\" and only the prosecutor can speak publicly about developments.",
      "Police and investigators are not supposed to divulge information about arrests or suspects without the prosecutor's approval, though in previous high-profile cases, police union officials have leaked partial details. Beccuau on Saturday rued the leak of information about the ongoing investigation.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria.",

      "FIFA began the process of selling another 1 million tickets for next year\u2019s World Cup on Monday, with the opening of a new ticket draw marking the start of the tournament\u2019s second phase of sales.",
      "This draw, which runs through 11 a.m. Eastern Friday, includes a domestic exclusivity time slot for residents of the three host countries \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Fans from those countries, whose entries are selected out of this draw, will have the opportunity to buy single-match tickets for games taking place inside their home nation.",
      "The phase is open to all fans, regardless of which country they live.",
      "\u201cWe already have seen massive interest from around the world for this tournament, and especially from within the host countries as Canada, Mexico and the United States prepare to host the biggest FIFA World Cup yet,\u201d said Heimo Schirgi, the tournament\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cThis second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well.\u201d",
      "Those fans from the U.S, Canada and Mexico who enter the draw before it closes Friday have a chance to receive, through what FIFA says is a randomized process, a time slot during which they can buy tickets starting on Nov. 12. Those slots will be issued through Nov. 15. Fans who win those chances will receive word at least 48 hours before their time slot opens.",
      "Residents of the three host countries \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Mexico, in that order \u2014 purchased more tickets than those from any other nation in the initial phase of ticketing. England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina and France, in that order, rounded out the top 10.",
      "Once the domestic exclusivity time slot ends, more fans will be eligible to obtain a purchasing slot starting on Nov. 17. Additional tickets will be made available in subsequent phases, FIFA said.",
      "FIFA announced earlier this month that more than 1 million tickets have already been sold for next year\u2019s World Cup, with people from 212 different countries and territories having already purchased. So far, 28 of the 48 spots for teams in the field have been filled.",

An international friendly match between defending World Cup champion Argentina \u2014 featuring Lionel Messi \u2014 and Puerto Rico was moved from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, because of lagging ticket sales that some believe were in response to the immigration crackdown.",
      "Based on the listed stadium attendance figures, there are roughly 7.1 million seats to fill for the 104 matches for the tournament around 16 North American venues. It is unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public.",
      "Ticket data has shown that the lowest-priced seats \u2014 set at $60 \u2014 were available for at least 40 matches. Almost all seats for the vast majority of matches were set at a much higher price. The opening match for the U.S., to be played at Inglewood, California, had prices ranging from $560 to $2,735 when sales opened. On the resale site, at least one ticket for that opening U.S. match on June 12 was listed for more than $60,000 earlier this month.",
      "Fans with the option to purchase could choose seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is what FIFA officials call the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket costs are expected to fluctuate as soccer\u2019s biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time.",

Kennedy Jr. and his deputies against a chemical that is a mainstay of dental care.",

      "Those claims have been disputed by the American Dental Association, which has said there are no significant health problems associated with fluoride when used at the levels prescribed by dentists. The supplements can cause spotting or discoloration of teeth due to the extra fluoride, a downside the FDA also noted.",

      "The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for educators, wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for school leaders wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws. For Education Secretary Linda McMahon, it offers a preview of what she hopes to make permanent.",
      "Much of the department\u2019s work has gone completely cold. No new grants are being awarded, and civil rights investigations have been halted. Money is still flowing for key programs, but in many respects, schools and states are on their own.",
      "That\u2019s the vision President Donald Trump has promoted since his presidential campaign \u2014 a world where states fully have the reins of education policy with little or no influence from the federal government.",
      "Even before the shutdown, mass layoffs had left the agency with 2,400 employees, down from 4,100 when Trump took office. Remaining workers have mostly been furloughed during the budget impasse, leaving some 330 who are responsible for carrying out duties that are deemed essential.",
      "In a recent social media post, McMahon said the shutdown proves her department is unnecessary. \u201cTwo weeks in, millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal,\u201d McMahon wrote.",
      "She offered a more direct assessment days later, after the agency hit its 46th year: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a birthday cake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need an eviction notice.\u201d",
      "Some say the shutdown's impact has been more significant. They warn that funding for preschool centers and school meals is running out, and students with disabilities might not be getting the help they need.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the impact so far.",
      "Most of the billions of dollars the Education Department steers to schools each year went out the door in October, leaving schools funded until July.",
      "Other programs that aren\u2019t funded in advance face more uncertainty. That includes federally funded Head Start preschool centers and school nutrition programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Julia Martin, director of policy and government affairs at the Bruman Group, an education law firm.",
      "Districts are required to cover the cost of school meals and then seek reimbursement from the Department of Agriculture, but the agency said it only has two months of reimbursements left amid the shutdown.",
      "\u201cDistricts are really worried that they\u2019re going to have to dig deep into their pockets to fund meals,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The last remnants of federal COVID-19 aid are still being released by the Education Department, but reimbursements have slowed with fewer staff reviewing the requests, Martin said.",
      "America\u2019s public schools are primarily funded by states and cities, but federal funding plays an important role. The billions sent already to schools include grants to help low-income students, those with disabilities and other populations.",
      "Grant competitions to award smaller amounts of money have largely frozen. Schools and states that already received grants can keep spending them down, but all new grantmaking has ceased, the department said. At the college level, federal Pell grants for low-income students are still flowing, and the FAFSA financial aid form is still being processed.",
      "Ordinarily, states and schools rely on the department to answer questions on a wide range of topics \u2014 from special education laws to statewide academic assessments to laws requiring public schools to provide certain services to students at private schools.",

It maintains \u201cvery regular\u201d communication with states to field questions on coordinating aid to families and eliminating waitlists, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, a disability rights group.",

In August, the department rescinded 2015 guidance explaining schools\u2019 legal obligations to students who are learning English. But with no new guidance replacing it before the government shutdown, schools have questions about their responsibilities, said Martin, of the Bruman law firm.",

      "Bill Swick, who has a rare degenerative brain disease, has lost access to virtual speech therapy due to the federal government shutdown",
      "MINOOKA, Ill. -- Bill Swick has a rare degenerative brain disease that inhibits his mobility and speech. Instead of the hassle of traveling an hour to a clinic in downtown Chicago to visit a speech therapist, he has benefited from virtual appointments from the comfort of his home.",
      "But Swick, 53, hasn\u2019t had access to those appointments for the last month.",
      "The federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, halted funding for the Medicare telehealth program that pays his provider for her services. So, Swick and his wife are practicing old strategies rather than learning new skills to manage his growing difficulties with processing language, connecting words and pacing himself while speaking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we want to continue with his journey, with his progress,\u201d 45-year-old Martha Swick, a caregiver for her husband since his diagnosis three years ago, said during an interview at their home in Minooka, Illinois. \u201cI try to have all his therapy and everything organized for him, to make his day easier and smoother, and then everything has a hitch, and we have to stop and wait.\u201d",
      "Their experience has become common in recent weeks among the millions of patients with Medicare fee-for-service plans who count on pandemic-era telehealth waivers to attend medical appointments from home.",
      "With Congress unable to agree on a deal to fund the government, the waivers have lapsed, even with support from Republicans and Democrats. As a result, medical providers are deciding whether they can continue offering telehealth services without the guarantee of reimbursement or whether they need to halt virtual visits altogether.",
      "That\u2019s left a patient population of mostly older adults with fewer options to seek specialists or get help when they can\u2019t physically travel far from home.",
      "Swick, whose corticobasal degeneration causes symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, can\u2019t feed or dress himself anymore and struggles with balance and walking. Add on the logistical nightmare of driving to the city in traffic, and in-person speech therapy appointments aren\u2019t a worthwhile ordeal for him and his wife.",
      "But missing even a few appointments can impede progress for patients with dementia and other degenerative conditions who depend on continuity of care, experts said.",
      "It \u201cfeels like you\u2019re taking a step back,\u201d Swick said in the interview.",
      "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare only paid for virtual medical appointments under narrow circumstances, including in designated rural areas and when patients logged in from eligible sites, like hospitals and clinics.",
      "That changed in 2020, when Trump\u2019s first administration dramatically expanded telehealth coverage in response to the public health emergency. Medicare started reimbursing a wide range of telehealth visits, stripping the geographic requirement, and allowing patients to take calls from their homes.",
      "Congress has routinely extended the telehealth flexibilities and was poised to do so again before their Sept. 30 expiration. But when budget negotiations stalled and the government shut down Oct. 1, the vote never happened, leaving the program temporarily unfunded.",
      "With more than 4 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries using telehealth in the first half of 2025, according to Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health, the pause has had a major impact on an already vulnerable population.",
      "Swick\u2019s speech therapy services are provided by the Chicago-area business Memory and Aphasia Care. Owner Becky Khayum said many of her clients are in different cities and states and sought her therapists out because they specialize in frontal temporal dementias.",
      "\u201cNow suddenly without telehealth services, they do not continue to have the support to participate in those activities that are so important to them,\u201d Khayum said. \u201cThe risk is we could see social withdrawal; we could see depression and anxiety increased.\u201d",

Dr. Faraz Ghoddusi, a family medicine provider in Tigard, Oregon, said he uses telehealth to check in and help his patients manage their conditions, like diabetes and chronic lung disease. He said that in the current Medicare telehealth pause, one of his patients wasn\u2019t having regular check-ins and ended up in the emergency room.",
      "Susan Collins, 73, in Murrieta, California, said Medicare-reimbursed telehealth appointments were a \u201ctremendous relief\u201d to her when she was a full-time caregiver for her late husband, Leo. Before he died last year from progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disorder, she struggled to lift him from his wheelchair in and out of the car for his in-person doctor visits 60 miles from their home.",
      "\u201cHe was much safer at home,\u201d Collins said, noting that telehealth was a useful resource when her husband needed a medication or symptom consultation but not a complete physical exam.",
      "The latest guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not ban medical providers from providing telehealth services during the lapse \u2013 but it stops short of promising they\u2019ll be reimbursed if they do.",
      "In response, providers are deciding whether they can absorb the risk of continuing care without assurance that they\u2019ll be paid for it when the government reopens.",
      "Khayum in Illinois said she had to stop providing telehealth services to Medicare patients because her small business couldn\u2019t handle the volatility of potentially losing out on payments. Ghoddusi, the family medicine provider, said his Oregon practice is honoring telehealth appointments made before Oct. 1 but not scheduling additional ones for Medicare patients until the funding is restored.",
      "Genevieve Richardson, owner of a speech pathology business in Austin, Texas, has stopped providing telehealth services to her Medicare clients who are spread across the country. She has been referring them to outpatient clinics in their areas who can provide stopgap services in person.",
      "Major hospitals are also grappling with whether to provide virtual care to Medicare patients. Dr. Helen Hughes, medical director of the Office of Telemedicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the hospital initially continued the care, but paused scheduling more Medicare telehealth visits as of Oct. 16 as the shutdown continued.",
      "She said the uncertainty surrounding the waivers has been \u201ca total roller coaster.\u201d",
      "The government shutdown is in its fifth week with no clear end on the horizon. Meanwhile, Medicare telehealth flexibilities and a separate Medicare program offering patients hospital-level care at home both remain paused.",
      "Mei Kwong, executive director of the Center for Connected Health Policy, said the simplest solution to renewing the telehealth waivers would be for Congress to vote separately on them.",
      "The hands of federal health care administrators \u201care kind of tied,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, you really do need Congress to act.\u201d",
      "But with lawmakers divided and looking for leverage, hopes for such action are low.",
      "Martha Swick, practicing word exercises with her husband in their home on a recent morning, said if a solution isn\u2019t found soon, \u201cmy resource collection is going to run out.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just doing what I\u2019m able to at home as a wife and a caregiver,\u201d she said. \u201cBut eventually I\u2019m really going to need those appointments to come back.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Alaska Supreme Court is weighing a case that is expected to determine who can provide abortion care in the state.",
      "The court heard arguments Wednesday in a 2019 case challenging the constitutionality of a law that states only a doctor licensed by the State Medical Board can perform an abortion in Alaska.",
      "The law, dating to the 1970s, was struck down as unconstitutional by Superior Court judge Josie Garton last year, a victory for the group that brought the challenge, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky. The state appealed Garton's ruling.",
      "Planned Parenthood has argued there is no medical justification for the restriction and that it unfairly burdens those seeking an abortion by limiting the pool of those qualified to provide care. In 2021, Garton granted the group\u2019s request to allow advanced practice clinicians \u2014 health care workers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants \u2014 to provide medication abortion pending her decision in the underlying case. They have continued to do so and since the 2024 ruling also have been able to provide procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood says.",
      "Advanced practice clinicians routinely provide care similar in risk and complexity to that of providing abortion services, and in 25 states can provide medication abortion, attorneys for Planned Parenthood said in court documents. Planned Parenthood's advanced practice clinicians seek to provide abortion care in just the first trimester, the attorneys said.",
      "Since Garton's 2021 decision, advanced practice clinicians have been providing \u201cnearly all\u201d medication abortions in Alaska, and Planned Parenthood clinics in the state have been able to offer medication abortion each day they've been open, the attorneys wrote. Before that, doctors hired by Planned Parenthood on a per diem basis \u2014 at the clinics on limited days \u2014 were able to offer medication abortions perhaps once or twice a week at each clinic, they wrote.",
      "A vital statistics report released by the state this year shows that the total number of abortions in Alaska has been fairly consistent \u2014 1,229 in 2021, 1,247 in 2022, 1,222 in 2023 and 1,224 last year. The report says that could include cases where medication was provided to manage a miscarriage, but without providing a number. It also says reasons for ending pregnancies are not reported to the state.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a federal right to abortion, leaving it up to each state to regulate.",
      "Access to health care has been a longstanding concern in Alaska, with travel \u2014 sometimes covering hundreds of miles \u2014 required for many residents. Compounding that are ongoing challenges to recruit and keep medical providers.",

      "BERLIN -- The organization that handles claims on behalf of Jews who suffered under the Nazis said Wednesday that Germany has agreed to extend another $1.076 billion (923.9 million euros) for Holocaust survivors ' home care around the globe for the coming year.",
      "The compensation was negotiated with Germany\u2019s finance ministry and is the largest budget for frail and vulnerable Holocaust survivor home care in the organization\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cThis historic increase to home care funding reflects the complex and growing needs of Holocaust survivors worldwide,\u201d said Gideon Taylor, the president of the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference.",
      "\u201cWhile we are losing survivors at a rapid pace each year, those who remain are older, frailer and in greater need than ever before,\u201d Taylor said in a written statement. \"This budget is critical in providing each of them the opportunity to age in place, a dignity that was stolen from them in their youth.\u201d",
      "The average age of survivors receiving home care through Claims Conference funding has increased from 86 in 2018 to 88.5 in 2024. Data collected by the organization show that survivors are experiencing more complicated health needs and increased disability, with the number of survivors who qualify for full-time assistance due to extreme disability \u2014 such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia \u2014 has nearly doubled during that time period.",
      "Additionally, the Hardship Fund Supplemental payments, which were previously guaranteed to be paid annually to eligible Holocaust survivors until 2027, have been extended through 2028 at an amount of \u20ac1,450 per survivor, impacting more than 127,000 Holocaust survivors globally.",
      "The Claims Conference projected in April that approximately 200,000 survivors are still alive, most of them living in Israel, the United States and Europe, but also scattered all over the globe.",
      "Also, righteous rescuers \u2013 non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust - currently receiving a monthly pension from the Claims Conference, will be eligible to receive home care similar to that provided to Jewish survivors, allowing them to live their final years with dignity in their own homes, the group announced.",

Her father wants to be a grandfather and her mother, before she died, always told Porretto that she would eventually want to be a mom.",

      "Younger generations of Americans are increasingly citing climate change as making them reticent to have children, according to several studies. They are worried about bringing children into a world with increasing and more intense extreme weather events, a result of climate change, which is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when oil, gas coal are burned. And they are concerned about the impact their offspring will have on the planet.",
      "In a 2024 Lancet study of people 16 to 25 years old, the majority of respondents were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d worried about climate change. The study also found that 52% said they were hesitant to have children because of climate change. Adults under 50 years old without children were four times more likely than adults over 50 without children to say that climate plays a factor in their decision, according to a Pew Research Center report published last year. And a study published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found more than half of respondents said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d to whether climate change made them question having children.",
      "Parenthood and climate change are related not just because of fears for a child's well-being, but also by concern for the planet's well-being.",
      "Compared to the carbon emissions of all the other decisions, \"having a child is by far, by orders of magnitude, larger,\u201d said Nandita Bajaj, executive director of Population Balance, which is a nonprofit focused on humans' environmental impact.",
      "Unlike other choices, procreation comes with something that bioethics professor Travis Rieder of Johns Hopkins University calls \u201ccarbon legacy.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not only doing carbon expensive activities like buying a larger house and a larger car and diapers and all that,\" said Rieder. \u201cYou\u2019re also creating someone who is going to have their own carbon footprint for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "That child might have children, and those children might have children, creating an impact that lasts generations, Rieder added. Of course, the logical extreme of minimizing an environmental footprint means having no children, Rieder said, which he is not advocating.",
      "It's tricky to quantify the impact of a child. That's because there's no consensus on what percentage of their impact is the parent's responsibility, and partly because the impact of that child depends on their parents' lifestyle.",
      "\u201cOne of the best predictors of how carbon-expensive they\u2019ll be is how wealthy you are,\u201d Rieder said.",
      "For example, the U.S. emits 123 times more carbon emissions than Ghana, according to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. Adjusted for population size, that means the average American emits more than 12 times as much as the average Ghanan.",
      "Procreation might have the largest climate impact, but when it comes to actions people can take to reduce their personal contribution to global warming, having fewer children often isn't discussed.",
      "Researchers who study climate change and family planning give two reasons.",

      "Seaweed has been farmed off Zanzibar for decades, but there is a new boom underway for global industries like cosmetics",
      "ZANZIBAR, Tanzania -- The women wade with baskets near the beaches, their colorful dresses a magnet for tourist cameras. Sunscreen worn by the holidaymakers may even contain the product the women are collecting: Zanzibar\u2019s seaweed.",
      "An eco-friendly local industry that employs thousands of women, the seaweed farming looks like a picture postcard \u2014 even if the reality of the work is grimmer than what meets the eye.",
      "\u201cI experience pain in my back, waist and chest due to the labor in the sea. There are also risks of being stung or bitten,\u201d said one farmer, Mwanaisha Makame Simai. \u201cSometimes strong waves sweep you away. I have personally witnessed three cases of people drowning.\u201d",
      "Seaweed has been farmed off Zanzibar, part of Tanzania's Indian Ocean coast, for decades but there is a new boom underway as global demand increases.",
      "Seaweed is primarily exported to the global food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, which extract their thickening and stabilizing agents.",
      "In Zanzibar, private investment and donor dollars have been increasing. Seaweed is the third largest contributor to the local economy after tourism and spices.",
      "\u201cTen years ago, people thought you were crazy for working in seaweed,\u201d said Klara Schade, director at Mwani Zanzibar, which describes itself as a boutique seaweed farm and factory in the village of Paje. \u201cNow it\u2019s become a buzzword.\u201d",
      "Mwani even runs seaweed tours in Paje to introduce the work.",
      "For the government of the semi-autonomous archipelago, seaweed is at the heart of its \u201cblue economy\u201d initiative to drive growth from sustainable marine and coastal resources.",
      "Cargill, one of the world\u2019s largest commodity trading firms, invested an unspecified amount in Zanzibari seaweed in 2020 in a partnership with The Nature Conservancy, with a view to improving yields and farmers' incomes.",
      "Other nongovernmental organizations have stepped up funding, including the Global Seaweed Coalition, which oversees the safety and sustainability of the sector as it scales up.",
      "Most of Zanzibar\u2019s 25,000 seaweed farmers are women, notable in a society where fewer than half of women are employed, according to a government census taken in 2021.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with five of the women, who described sometimes harsh working conditions in the manual labor. The vast majority of seaweed farmers work independently or in collectives, selling to local middlemen. There are few if any protections.",
      "Long days are spent wading under the equatorial sun. Back aches and skin irritation can result, with stings from sea urchins or other creatures being another worry.",
      "\u201cThere are health and safety challenges in this work,\u201d said Simai, an independent farmer who said she makes around $50 per month to help support her small family of two. The work may be more challenging for those with larger families, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy job, it\u2019s tiresome,\u201d said Pili Khalid Pandu, 43, who works for Mwani, doing rotations between its factory and collecting in the sea.",

      "The hope for the sector, as with many natural resource industries in Africa, is making more of the supply chain local. This is the goal at Mwani Zanzibar, where Schade has focused on training seaweed farmers in cosmetics manufacturing.",
      "Workers at Mwani spend more of their time in its Paje workshop and less in the sea. Schade said Mwani\u2019s high-end cosmetics \u2014 a bottle of its \u201cface and body skin superfood\u201d sells online for $140 \u2014 mean its workers make far more than the average seaweed farmer.

      "But the stress can be reduced if people have a plan for preparing their homes and for deciding whether to stay and ride out a storm or evacuate, according to emergency management officials. That preparation, which includes putting together a kit of essential supplies, should begin long before a storm is approaching.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent, take preparedness seriously, spend the time now to do the little things that will make a big difference for you and your loved ones when something does happen,\u201d said Brian Mason, director of Houston\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.",
      "Anything in the backyard that isn\u2019t tied down, such as furniture and barbecue grills, should be secured or brought inside so it doesn't become a projectile that can come through a window, said Shawn Schulze, regional CEO for the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region.",

      "Mason recommends that homeowners get their roofs inspected before each hurricane season and know how to turn off their utilities in case of damage.",
      "Well before a storm is brewing, people should trim or remove dead or weakened tree limbs and shrubs that hang over their homes to lessen potential damage from high winds, said Mistie Hinote, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Insurance.",

    "story": [
      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",
      "Asked Wednesday on CNN whether Republicans have a plan to address the subsidies if the government reopened, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had \u201cproposals\u201d that can be \u201cready immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated, very complex issue, that requires a long time to build consensus around,\u201d he said.",
      "With notices of premium spikes landing in mailboxes now and the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans beginning Nov. 1, the political pressure has been evident in Republican town halls.",
      "In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that \u201cgovernment provided health care is the wrong path\u201d and that \u201cprivate health care is the right path.\u201d In Texas, freshman Rep. Brandon Gill responded to a caller facing a sharp premium increase by saying Republicans are focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse.",

More than 24 million people were enrolled in the marketplace plans in 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020, according to an analysis from the health care research nonprofit KFF.",

      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared with about one-quarter who trust the Republicans more, a recent AP-NORC poll found. About one-quarter trust neither party, and about 1 in 10 trust both equally, according to the poll.",
      "Even as GOP leaders pledge to discuss ending the subsidies when the government opens, it's clear that many Republican lawmakers are adamantly opposed to an extension.",
      "\u201cAt least among Republicans, there\u2019s a growing sense that just maintaining the status quo is very destructive,\u201d said Brian Blase, the president of Paragon Health Institute and a former health policy adviser to Trump during his first term.",
      "Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he\u2019s working with multiple congressional offices on alternatives that would let the subsidies end. For example, he wants to expand the Affordable Care Act exemption given to U.S. territories to all 50 states and reintroduce a first-term Trump policy that gave Americans access to short-term health insurance plans outside the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Cannon declined to name the lawmakers he\u2019s working with, but said he hopes they act on his ideas \u201csooner than later.\u201d",
      "David McIntosh, president of the influential conservative group Club For Growth, told reporters Thursday that the group has \u201curged the Republicans not to extend those COVID-era subsidies.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa has devastated Jamaica, causing severe damage to fishing and farming communities",
      "The updates sent by friends and neighbors on WhatsApp confirmed what fisher Prince Davis already feared: Hurricane Melissa put a hole in the stern of his 50-foot (15-meter) fishing boat, and damaged the cabin and back deck.",
      "His father's boat was nowhere to be found. The roof of the house Davis and his parents shared in the small Jamaican fishing community of White House in Westmoreland parish was also destroyed.",
      "Davis was in Nicaragua, where he'd flown shortly before the storm to find new customers for his fish business. But now his livelihood, and the livelihoods of many in his community, were in peril.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very rough\u201d said Davis. \u201cWith the damage now, no one will be buying products.\u201d",
      "About 29 kilometers (17 miles) northwest in Amity, also in Westmoreland parish, Denver Thorpe lost 15 acres (6 hectares) of mango trees and two greenhouses on his farm.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing,\u201d said Thorpe, a farmer and regional manager for the Jamaica Agricultural Society, a farmer advocacy organization.",
      "Hurricane Melissa is blamed for at least 19 deaths in Jamaica, bringing catastrophic winds up to 185 mph (298 kph) and storm surge that wrecked homes and public infrastructure.",
      "While official damage assessments are still underway, experts said it's already clear that one of the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded also dealt a devastating blow to tens of thousands of Jamaican fishers and farmers who feed their families and nearby communities.",
      "Similar impacts will be felt by some of Cuba and Haiti \u2019s small producers, said Lola Castro, World Food Program regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean.",
      "\u201cI would say every (crop) that was on the path has been damaged, there\u2019s no discussion on that,\u201d said Castro. \u201cSome of the fruit trees may be recovered, some of the temporary crops will not be recovered at all.\u201d",
      "The destruction will impact how residents earn income and feed their families at a time when they must also rebuild homes and communities. There were already 10 million food-insecure people across the affected countries of Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, said Castro. The WFP does not have that data for Cuba.",
      "In Jamaica, the destruction comes just 15 months after Hurricane Beryl impacted more than 50,000 farmers and 11,000 fishers, and caused $4.73 billion Jamaican dollars (about $29 million) in losses, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining.",
      "\u201cWe were just about turning the corner,\u201d said Thorpe.",
      "Jamaica\u2019s agriculture ministry did not respond to questions about sector impacts, but the country has more than 200,000 farmers tending livestock and growing bananas, melons, cocoa and much more.",
      "The food produced is for domestic consumption and export \u2014 Jamaica is one of the world's largest yam exporters and its coffee growers generate $25 million annually, according to the Jamaica Coffee Exporters Association.",
      "Around 80% are small-scale producers, working on 2 hectares of land or less, said Donovan Campbell, geography professor and director of the University of the West Indies\u2019 western campus.",
      "\u201cSmall-scale fishing and small-scale farming is what most people use to make a living,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really the lifeblood of the most vulnerable in our society.\u201d",
      "Farmers use October rains to plant crops to harvest before Christmas. Before the storm, the agriculture ministry urged fishers to move equipment out of harm's way and farmers to move livestock and harvest any crops they could.",
      "The devastation exceeded most expectations. Officials Wednesday said St. Elizabeth parish, known as Jamaica's \u201cbreadbasket,\" was \u201c under water.\" The parish had over 35,000 registered farmers and fishers as of 2022, according to the Jamaica Information Service.",

      "For fishers, Davis said it's not just losing boats, nets and traps that endangers their work. Without electricity, there\u2019s no ice to store what they catch, and customers won\u2019t buy what they can\u2019t keep cold. Lack of tourism will hurt demand, too.",
      "The slowdown is worse for fishers who use most of their catch to feed their families and sell a little extra, he said. \u201cThat small income every day maintains their house and their family and their school and children.\"",
      "There are also special risks for women producers, said Davis and Campbell, many of whom are heads of household who support their children with the small amounts they sell.",
      "Cuba and Haiti face similar challenges, exacerbated by their political and economic crises.",
      "The storm unleashed terrible flooding in southern Haiti and is blamed for 31 deaths in the country, where hunger was already rising.",
      "Castro of the World Food Program said the organization is concerned about the impact to some of Haiti's female producers, from whom the WFP typically buys produce to supply local schools.",
      "\u201cWe may need to bring food from other parts of the country if available or even having to import,\u201d said Castro.",
      "In Cuba, the evacuation of 735,000 people meant the country suffered no known deaths, but Melissa\u2019s passage could worsen challenges in feeding Cubans. The country faces a severe economic crisis and spends some $2 billion annually importing food products.",
      "Local officials said there was damage to plantain, corn and cassava crops, coffee, various vegetables and trees across the five affected eastern provinces.",
      "Government officials said Melissa\u2019s heavy rainfall did benefit dams and reservoirs, after the eastern part of the country had been suffering from a severe drought and water shortage.",
      "\u201cThat is one of the silver linings,\u201d said Margarita Fernandez, executive director of the Caribbean Agroecology Institute in Vermont. CAI is raising funds to send directly to farmers and cooperatives there. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization also delivered seed to Cuba ahead of the storm, a spokesperson said.",
      "Relief efforts across the northern Caribbean are focused on immediate needs for now, as first responders and humanitarian organizations provide shelter, health care, food and clean water, and restore power and communications.",
      "Food producers will soon need cash to make up for lost income, help replacing equipment and animals as well as new seed.",
      "The Jamaican government keeps reserve funds, parametric insurance policies and catastrophe bonds for disasters. The government and nonprofits helped farmers and fishers after Hurricane Beryl replace what they lost.",
      "But it can take a long time for that help to reach small scale producers, said Campbell.",
      "With airports open again, Davis is looking for a flight to get back to White House. He needs to fix his boat, and his roof, but he doesn't know when he will sell fish again.",
      "\u201cMy worry is about when will the economy will be back to normal, where life goes on as it was before,\u201d said Davis. \u201cEveryone is picking up the pieces.\"",

    "story": [
      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, King Charles III's younger brother, is facing internal exile",
      "LONDON -- Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the disgraced younger brother of King Charles III, is going into internal exile that will see him further hidden from view from a clearly angry British public.",
      "His ejection from the 30-room Royal Lodge on the grounds of Windsor Castle to one of the properties on the king's private estate at Sandringham in the east of England will symbolize the downfall of the one-time prince and duke.",
      "Though he's lost his perks of title and status, Andrew, 65, will not be slumming it.",
      "But it is a banishment nonetheless that leaves Andrew increasingly exposed to scrutiny both in the U.K. and the U.S. over his friendship with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew denies allegations of improper behavior during his long friendship with Epstein, including from Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claimed she had sex with the ex-prince when she was 17.",
      "Following years of scandals related to Andrew, Charles arguably took the biggest step of his reign Thursday by seeking to insulate the monarchy from any exposure emanating from Andrew's connections with Epstein, who took his own life in prison in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, more than a decade after his initial conviction.",
      "Andrew has been given notice that his time at Royal Lodge, the mansion near Windsor Castle where he has lived for more than 20 years, is coming to an end. He signed a 75-year lease in 2003 with the Crown Estate, a portfolio of properties that is nominally owned, but not controlled, by the monarch.",
      "He invested a required 7.5 million pounds ($9.9 million) to refurbish the home and now resides there for the annual sum of a peppercorn, a symbolic figure often used to satisfy the legal requirement of real estate transactions.",
      "His move won\u2019t happen overnight. As everyone knows, moving house is an ordeal at the best of times, regardless of the size of the dwelling. It's certainly going to take Andrew, and whoever he can get to help him, a fair chunk of time to go through his belongings, decide what to take, give to charity or what to toss.",
      "There's also the little matter of divvying up possessions with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with Andrew at Royal Lodge since 2008, but who will not be moving on to Sandringham at Charles' expense.",
      "With Christmas looming, the likely time and effort is no bad thing for a royal family seeking to isolate Andrew. The last thing the 76-year-old monarch, and his son, the heir to the throne Prince William, will want is Andrew within shouting distance on Christmas Day when members of the royal family go to St. Mary Magdalene church on the Sandringham Estate, before what is no doubt a majestic banquet at the king's main residence, Sandringham House, and its 100 or so rooms.",
      "So the expectation is that Andrew will move to his new home in one of the U.K.\u2019s least densely populated counties, after all the festivities have concluded.",
      "The Sandringham Estate is not an official royal residence, which means it's not owned by the state, a fact that Charles will hope will keep a lid on the public's anger. Charles will be funding Andrew's relocation and provide his brother an annual stipend from his own private resources. In effect, Andrew will not live out his vintage years at the expense of the British taxpayer.",

      "Sandringham, the private home of the last six British monarchs, sits amid parkland, gardens and working farms about 110 miles (180 kilometers) north of London. It has been owned by the royal family since 1862, passing directly from one monarch to the next for more than 160 years.",
      "It was recorded in the Domesday Book, the survey of lands in England compiled by William the Conqueror in 1086, as \u201cSant Dersingham,\u201d or the sandy part of Dersingham. That was shortened to Sandringham in later years.",
      "Queen Victoria bought Sandringham for her eldest son, Edward, in 1862, largely in hopes that becoming a country gentleman would keep the playboy prince out of trouble in the nightspots of London, Paris, Monte Carlo and Biarritz. The future Edward VII transformed the estate into a modern country retreat to be passed on from one generation to the next.",
      "The monarchs since have inherited it \u2014 and loved it. Charles was a fan from a young boy, joining shooting parties in the 1950s, with one photograph catching him blowing a miniature hunting trumpet while sitting on horseback.",
      "There is growing speculation that Andrew will not be moving to Wood Farm on the estate, the property favored by his mother, Queen Elizabeth II and father, Prince Philip, who preferred its cosy surroundings to the grandiose main residence.",
      "But there are a number of other properties available, including Park House, the birthplace and childhood home of Diana, Princess of Wales. The late princess continued to live there until the death of her grandfather in 1975.",
      "York Cottage is another possibility. It's where King George V, Andrew's great-grandfather, lived before becoming monarch in 1910.",
      "The cottage, which is not a cottage in the traditional sense given it has multiple bedrooms and a lake nearby, was reportedly earmarked for William's brother, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, before they decided to ditch their royal lives and go and live in the U.S.",
      "York Cottage, which has often been used as holiday accommodation, may have one problem, though. It does after all share the name of the dukedom that Andrew used to have \u2014 a constant reminder of what's transpired.",
      "Another option for Andrew could be Gardens House, which was once home to the estate\u2019s head gardener. It has four bedrooms, three bathrooms and is being used as a holiday let, according to Sandringham\u2019s website.",
      "The Folly, which has been a hunting lodge and a place where ladies enjoyed afternoon tea, would certainly see Andrew downsizing substantially. It only has three bedrooms \u2014 but as a single man, does he really need any more?",

      "The scale of the task facing him has been underscored by the king's dramatic decision to strip his brother Andrew of his royal title and Windsor home over his friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. William was consulted on the move to take away Andrew's honors as allegations against the king's brother threatened to envelop the royal family.",
      "In recent weeks, William has appeared alongside his father at a gala COP30 event in London, wiped away tears while talking to a grieving widow about her husband\u2019s suicide, and given an interview to actor Eugene Levy in which he discussed his plans for the monarchy.",
      "\u201cHe is sending a lot of signals about how he wants to be monarch when his time comes,\u2019\u2019 said Sally Bedell Smith, author of \u201cPrince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life.\"",
      "\u201cAnd given the fact his father has been ill now really for almost two years, I think that it would be irresponsible for them not to be paving the way for what we hope won\u2019t happen any time soon.\u2019\u2019",
      "Charles, to be sure, shows few signs of slowing down, hosting U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s state visit in September before jetting off to pray with Pope Leo XIV a month later. But behind the vigor is the reality that the king will turn 77 this month and has been undergoing treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer since early 2024.",
      "And so the palace prepares, discreetly, as it always does.",
      "Unlike the prime minister and Parliament, which exist in the day-to-day realities of electoral politics, Britain\u2019s hereditary monarchy thinks years, if not decades, ahead, said Craig Prescott an expert on the monarchy and constitutional law at Royal Holloway University of London.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Canada and the Philippines, both staunch critics of China\u2019s increasingly coercive actions in the disputed South China Sea, were to sign a key defense agreement on Sunday that would allow their forces to hold joint battle-readiness drills and expand a web of security alliances to deter aggression, Philippine officials said.",
      "Canada and other Western nations have been bolstering their military presence in the Indo-Pacific to help promote the rule of law and expand trade and investment in the region. The moves dovetail with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\u2019s efforts to build defense ties with other countries to help his country\u2019s underfunded military face a militarily superior China in the disputed waters.",
      "There was no immediate comment from China, which has accused the Philippines of being a \u201ctroublemaker\u201d and a \u201csaboteur of regional stability\u201d for staging joint patrols and combat drills with the United States and other countries in the South China Sea. Beijing claims the waterway, a major trade route, virtually in its entirety despite a 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated those claims based on the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.",
      "China has dismissed the ruling and continues to defy it. It has employed powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers against Philippine coast guard and fisheries vessels in the disputed waters. resulting in minor collisions and injuries to Filipino personnel. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also been involved in the long-simmering territorial disputes.",

      "The Philippines signed the first such defense pact with its longtime treaty ally, the United States, in 1998, followed by a similar accord with Australia nine years later. The agreement with Canada would be the third signed under Marcos after similar ones with Japan and New Zealand.",

      "Britain\u2019s King George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in 1917, and initiated legislation to strike out the titles of princes and lords \u201cwho have, during the present war, borne arms against His Majesty or His Allies, or who have adhered to His Majesty\u2019s enemies.\u201d",
      "One target was Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who was a U.K. royal and also a prince of Hanover. His title was removed for being an enemy of Britain under the 1917 act, which was enacted in 1919, once the war was over.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has bestowed one of the Catholic Church\u2019s highest honors on St. John Henry Newman, declaring him a doctor of the church",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Leo XIV on Saturday bestowed one of the Catholic Church\u2019s highest honors on St. John Henry Newman, the deeply influential 19th- century British convert and theologian, declaring him a doctor of the church and holding him up as a model for Catholic educators.",
      "Only 37 other people have been given the title \u201cdoctor\u201d in the 2,000-year history of the Catholic Church. Newman now joins the ranks of such monumental Christian figures as St. Augustine, St. Therese of Lisieux and St. John of the Cross.",
      "The title recognizes that Newman, beloved in both the Anglican and Catholic churches, has universal appeal and made a timeless, eminent contribution to understanding the Christian faith.",
      "A theologian and poet raised in the Church of England, Newman is best known for his writings and sermons on the development of doctrine, truth and the nature of a university. He is admired by conservatives and progressives alike, because he followed his conscience at great personal cost when he decided to convert to Catholicism in 1845.",
      "Leo pronounced Newman a church doctor on Saturday during a special Holy Year Mass for Catholic teachers and students, during which he also declared Newman a co-patron of Catholic education, alongside St. Thomas Aquinas.",
      "It was particularly fitting: It was Leo\u2019s namesake, Pope Leo XIII, who made Newman a Catholic cardinal after his conversion, and it was the earlier Leo who declared Aquinas a doctor of the church and patron of Catholic education.",
      "Leo\u2019s decision to hold out Newman as a model for Catholic educators suggests that Catholic teaching will be a priority for him going forward, especially as he emphasizes the ethical use of artificial intelligence for future generations.",
      "Earlier this week, Leo penned a new document that cited Newman in his call for Catholic schools to be places for spiritual growth and community, and where the use of technology always keeps human dignity front and center.",
      "In his homily, Leo quoted from Newman\u2019s most famous text, the beloved British hymn \u201cLead, Kindly Light,\u201d to urge that Catholic educators \u201cshine like stars in the world\u201d in the collective search for truth.",
      "\u201cThe task of education is precisely to offer this Kindly Light to those who might otherwise remain imprisoned by the particularly insidious shadows of pessimism and fear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are called to form people, so that they may shine like stars in their full dignity.\u201d",
      "The Catholic Church is one of the world\u2019s leading players in education, operating more than 225,000 primary and secondary schools and enrolling some 2.5 million students at Catholic universities around the globe, according to Vatican statistics.",
      "Leo was educated by the Augustinians, taught math and physics, and is a member of the Augustinian religious order, which places a special emphasis on St. Augustine\u2019s search for truth and the command \u201cTolle, lege,\u201d which translates from Latin as \u201cTake up and read.\u201d",

      "The Rev. George Bowen, the postulator who oversaw Newman\u2019s canonization and designation as a doctor, said Newman too was confronted with the 19th-century equivalent of the information age, when cheap periodicals were readily available and reading rates shot up. Newman insisted on the need for a wholistic liberal education that included Catholic theology, but also focused on students and teachers interacting in a relational way in the quest for truth and knowledge, he said.",
      "\u201cSuddenly, the world was swimming with information,\u201d Bowen told reporters. \u201cSo Newman\u2019s ways of coping with this huge ocean of knowledge and making sense of it, having a connected view, is something very, very relevant today.\u201d",
      "When Newman defected from the Church of England to the Catholic Church in 1845, he lost friends, work and even family ties, believing the truth he was searching for could only be found in the Catholic faith.",
      "And yet even today, Newman remains beloved in the Church of England. His hymns were sung last week in the Sistine Chapel when King Charles III prayed alongside Leo in the historic ecumenical service.",
      "Several important Anglican leaders wrote to the Vatican, supporting his designation as a church doctor, and the Anglican archbishop of York was invited to participate in Saturday's service. It featured the hymn, \u201cLead, Kindly Light,\u201d which remains a fixture of Anglican services.",
      "\u201cNewman is a big ecumenical figure in the sense that he owes his faith to his upbringing in the Church of England,\u201d Bowen said.",
      "Paul Shrimpton, a leading Newman scholar at Magdalen College, Oxford, said it was significant that each of the last popes had promoted Newman in his remarkably quick path to being declared a doctor of the church, underlining his universal appeal to progressive and liberals alike.",
      "St. John Paul II declared him venerable in 1991, in the first step to possible sainthood; Pope Benedict XVI beatified him during a 2010 visit to Birmingham, England; Pope Francis canonized him in 2019 with Charles in the audience, and now Leo declared him a church doctor.",
      "\u201cI think that speaks volumes,\u201d said Shrimpton, who contributed an essay on Newman\u2019s influence on Catholic education for the official Vatican dossier, or \u201cpositio\u201d that made the case for him to be declared a doctor. \u201cAll very different popes show that he is part of the universal teaching of church.\u201d",

      "Profits improved thanks to a mild hurricane season and more paper investment.",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The profits of Warren Buffett's company improved 17% thanks to a relatively mild hurricane season and more paper investment gains this year as Berkshire Hathaway continues to prepare for the legendary 95-year-old investor to relinquish the CEO title in January.",
      "But last month's $9.7 billion investment in OxyChem won't do much to diminish the $381.7 billion cash pile that Berkshire was sitting on at the end of September even though it is the biggest deal the company has made in years.",
      "The biggest thing on most investors' minds right now is that Buffett Vice Chair Greg Abel is set to succeed him as CEO in January, although Buffett will remain chairman at Berkshire. The Class A stock is well off its peak of $812,855, set just before Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting in May by announcing he will step back. It closed Friday at $715,740, but Berkshire still didn't buy back any of its own stock in the quarter, which suggests Buffett thinks it is still overvalued.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she expects investors will clamor for more details from Berkshire after Abel takes over, and that calls for the company to finally pay a dividend if it can't find better uses for all that cash will also grow louder. But with Buffett remaining chairman there may not be any immediate changes.",
      "\u201cThe lack of discussion and disclosure \u2014 I think has a lot of the investment community frustrated,\u201d Seifert said. Berkshire has never had public or investor relations departments, and the company skips the quarterly investor calls that nearly every public company holds. Buffett has long said he prefers to share results with every investor at the same time, on Saturdays, and give them the weekend to digest the results before the markets reopen.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that it earned $30.796 billion, or $21,413 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's up from last year's $26.251 billion, or $18,272 per A share.",
      "But those bottom-line figures are always distorted by the current value of Berkshire's massive investment portfolio and any stock sales, which this year added $17.3 billion to the company's profits.",

      "That\u2019s why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings to get a sense of how its many operating companies are performing, including well-known insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies.",
      "On that measure, Berkshire's operating profit jumped to $13.485 billion, or $9376.15 per Class A share, thanks to a strong rebound in its insurance companies. A year ago, Berkshire reported operating earnings of $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted Berkshire would report operating earnings of $8,573.50 per Class A share.",
      "Berkshire said fewer catastrophic losses from hurricanes this year compared to when Hurricane Helene ravaged the southeast a year ago helped its insurance underwriting profit jump $1.6 billion to $2.369 billion. The bottom line was also helped by $331 million in gains on debt held in foreign currencies this year, compared to a $1.1 billion loss on those holdings a year ago.",
      "Most of Berkshire's other companies performed well in the quarter although profits did decline nearly 9% at its utilities to $1.489 billion.",

    "story": [
      "Black vultures have killed and eaten several calves on Tom Karr\u2019s cattle ranch in southeastern Ohio, a loss he says didn't happen two decades ago",
      "EMINENCE, Ky. -- Allan Bryant scans the sky as he watches over a minutes-old calf huddled under a tree line with its mother. After a few failed tries, the calf stands on wobbly legs for the first time, looking to nurse.",
      "Above, a pair of birds circle in the distance. Bryant, hoping they're not black vultures, is relieved to see they're only turkey vultures \u2014 red-headed and not aggressive.",
      "\u201cHonestly, the black vulture is one of the ugliest things I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to hate.\u201d",
      "Black vultures, scavengers that sometimes attack and kill sick or newborn animals, didn't used to be a problem here. But now Bryant frequently sees the birds following a birth. He hasn't lost a calf in several years, but they've killed his animals before. So now he takes measures to stop them.",
      "In some of his fields, he erects a scarecrow of sorts \u2014 a dead black vulture \u2014 aimed at scaring off the birds. It's a requirement of his depredation permit through the Kentucky Farm Bureau, which allows him to shoot a few birds a year. The dead bird keeps the live birds away for about a week, but they eventually come back, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a problem that may grow worse for cattle farmers as the scavenging birds\u2019 range expands northward, in part due to climate change. Lobbying groups have been pushing for legislation that would allow landowners to kill more of these birds, which are protected but not endangered. But experts say more research is needed to better understand how the birds impact livestock and how their removal could affect ecosystems.",
      "Black vultures used to mainly live in the southeastern U.S. and farther south in Latin and South America, but over the past century they've started to rapidly stretch northward and also west into the desert Southwest, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration.",
      "Warmer winters on average, fueled by climate change, are making it easier for the birds to stay in places that used to be too cold for them. What's more, the human footprint in suburban and rural areas is enriching their habitat: development means cars, and cars mean roadkill. Cattle farms can also offer a buffet of vulnerable animals for vultures that learn the seasonal calving schedule.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from a lot of different studies of birds, it\u2019s that they are very good at taking advantage of food resources and remembering where those things are,\u201d Farnsworth said.",
      "Although black vultures are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, they aren't really a migratory species, he said. Instead, they breed, and some disperse to new areas and settle there.",
      "After losing a calf to a black vulture a decade ago, Tom Karr, who raises cattle near Pomeroy, Ohio, tried to move his fall calving season later in the year in hopes the vultures would be gone by then. But that didn't help \u2014 the birds stay all year, he said.",
      "Until newborn calves are a few days old, \u201cwe try to keep them up closer to the barns,\u201d said Joanie Grimes, the owner of a 350-head calf-cow operation in Hillsboro, Ohio. She said they've been dealing with the birds for 15 years, but keeping them out of remote fields has helped improve matters.",
      "Annette Ericksen has noticed the black vultures for several years on her property, Twin Maples Farm in Milton, West Virginia, but they haven't yet lost any animals to them. When they expect calves and lambs, they move the livestock into a barn, and they also use dogs \u2014 Great Pyrenees \u2014 trained to patrol the fields and the barnyard for raptors that might hurt the animals.",

Farmers said calves can be worth hundreds of dollars or upward of $1,000 or $2,000, depending on the breed.",
      "In March, lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill that would let farmers capture or kill any black vulture \u201cin order to prevent death, injury, or destruction to livestock.\u201d Many farmers and others in the cattle industry have supported the move, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in July commended the House Natural Resources Committee for advancing the bill.",

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n said Friday that he would try to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump to grant Hungary exemptions from Washington\u2019s newly announced sanctions targeting Russian oil when he meets with the president next week.",
      "The Trump administration unveiled sanctions against Russia\u2019s major state-affiliated oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil last week, a move that could expose their foreign buyers \u2014 including customers in India, China and Central Europe \u2014 to secondary sanctions.",
      "While most European Union member states sharply reduced or halted imports of Russian fossil fuels after Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Hungary and Slovakia have maintained their pipeline deliveries. Hungary has even increased the share of Russian oil in its energy mix.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, a Trump ally who is expected to visit Washington next week for his first bilateral meeting with the president since he retook office in January, has long argued that landlocked Hungary has no viable alternatives to Russian crude, and that replacing those supplies would trigger an economic collapse. Critics dispute that claim.",
      "\u201cWe have to make the Americans understand this strange situation if we want exceptions to the American sanctions that are hitting Russia,\u201d Orb\u00e1n said in comments Friday to state radio.",
      "The Hungarian leader, widely considered Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest partner in the EU, has maintained warm relations with the Kremlin, despite the war, and has taken a combative stance toward Ukraine, portraying the neighboring country as a major threat to Hungary's security and economy.",
      "Orb\u00e1n said Friday that both the U.S. administration and Moscow were seeking an end to the war, but that Ukraine and the EU were the primary impediments to peace. However, a planned meeting between Trump and Putin in Budapest was recently scrapped after Russian officials made clear they opposed an immediate ceasefire in the conflict.",

      "The stock has declined by 34% since that year in its most important fishing grounds, the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission said Thursday. The commission said it now considers overfishing of the species to be occurring, and that could bring new management measures that restrict fishermen from catching them in the future.",
      "Lobsters are among America's most lucrative seafood species, and they were worth more than $700 million at the docks last year. The industry caught record high numbers of the crustaceans in the 2010s.",
      "But the lobster population has shown \u201crapid declines in abundance in recent years,\u201d the commission said in a statement.",
      "The assessment said the decline and overfishing were taking place in fishing areas off Maine and Massachusetts where most lobster fishing takes place. The assessment also considered the southern New England lobster stock, which it said has been depleted for years and remains so.",

That would have required fishermen to throw back lobsters that previously could have been sold.",

But it will be hard to undercut China's stranglehold on the market.",
      "The restrictions China imposed on rare earths this year have been a key issue in the trade talks between Beijing and Washington. Trump responded angrily to China's latest rules with a threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, but he has since dropped that demand as part of this agreement.",
      "This week's deal will delay the regulations that would have required foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from China even if those products were made elsewhere by foreign companies, but it doesn't eliminate restrictions that were imposed in the spring after Trump imposed his tariffs.",
      "These critical minerals are needed in a broad range of products, from jet engines, radar systems, electric vehicles and robots to consumer electronics including laptops and phones. China accounts for nearly 70% of the world\u2019s rare earths mining. It also controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.",
      "Neha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said the one-year delay in China\u2019s new rare earth export controls that were announced earlier this month provides some short-term relief that will allow exports to return to a more normal level, but it doesn\u2019t change the broader strategic picture, and it's important for America and its allies to continue investing in the industry.",
      "\u201cThis move appears more tactical than structural, a pause to stabilize trade relations with the U.S. rather than a policy reversal,\u201d Mukherjee said. \"This is a temporary window for the U.S. and allies to accelerate diversification before controls likely return.\u201d",
      "The White House has made it a priority to revive and expand the domestic critical minerals industry while also seeking supplies of these elements from allies.

      "China has shown little sign of being willing to allow rare earth exports to defense contractors, which is concerning given the national security implications. But military demand for rare earths is relatively small, so America might be able to supply its needs by prioritizing rare earths from other sources for use in fighter jets, guided missiles and nuclear submarines.",

      "The Senate has passed a resolution that would undo many of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs around the globe",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a resolution Thursday that would undo many of President Donald Trump's tariffs around the globe, the latest note of displeasure at his trade tactics in Washington that came just as the president celebrated his negotiations with China as a success.",
      "After a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said he would cut tariffs on the Asian economic giant and China would in turn purchase 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually for the next three years. The Republican president claimed his trade negotiation would secure \u201cprosperity and security to millions of Americans.\u201d",
      "But back in Washington, senators \u2014 several from Trump's Republican Party \u2014 have demonstrated their dissent with Trump's tariff tactics by passing a series of resolutions this week that would nullify the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify the import taxes. Already this week, the Senate approved resolutions to end tariffs imposed on Brazil and Canada. While the legislative efforts are ultimately doomed, they exposed fault lines in the GOP.",
      "The latest resolution, which would effectively end most of Trump's tariff policies, passed on a 51-47 vote, with four Republicans joining with all Democrats.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who backed Democrats on the resolutions, credited Trump for decreasing the tariffs on China, but said the result is \u201cstill much higher than we\u2019ve had.\u201d",
      "\"It still will lead to increased prices,\" he said.",
      "The votes were orchestrated by Democrats using a decades-old law that allows Congress to nullify a presidential emergency. But House Republicans have instituted a new law that allows the leadership to prevent such resolutions from coming up for a vote. Plus, Trump would surely veto legislation that inhibits his power over trade policy, meaning the legislation won't ultimately take effect.",
      "But Democrats have still been able to force the Senate to take up an uncomfortable topic for their Republican colleagues.",
      "\u201cAmerican families are being squeezed by prices going up and up and up,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a floor speech. He added that \u201cin many ways, red states in rural areas are being hit the hardest,\u201d and pointed to economic strain being put on farmers and manufacturers.",
      "Overall there has been little movement among Republicans to oppose Trump's import taxes publicly. A nearly identical resolution failed in April on a tied vote after Republican Sen.

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 American farmers welcomed China's promise to buy some of their soybeans, but they cautioned this won't solve all their problems as they continue to deal with soaring prices for fertilizer, tractors, repair parts and seeds.",
      "The Chinese promise to buy at least 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually for next three years will bring their purchases back in line with where they were before President Donald Trump launched his trade war with China in the spring. But the 12 million metric tons that China plans to buy between now and January is only about half the typical annual volume.",
      "\u201cThis is a very good thing. I\u2019m very grateful,\u201d said Iowa farmer Robb Ewoldt, who is a director with the United Soybean Board. \"I don\u2019t want to sound like a ungrateful farmer, but it doesn\u2019t cure everything in the short term.\u201d",
      "Missouri farmer Bryant Kagay said it\u2019s somewhat \"crazy\u201d that everyone is getting so excited about this deal when all it does is get farmers back to where they were before this trade war began.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why you would go to war on trade if you didn\u2019t expect you could get a better outcome in the end,\u201d said Kagay, who is part owner of Kagay Farms in Amity, Missouri,",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China also agreed to remove all its retaliatory tariffs on American ag products, which should open the door for sales of other crops and beef. Plus, China promised to resume buying U.S. sorghum, which is another crop largely used for animal feed that depends on that market. More than half the sorghum and soybean crops are exported every year with much of that going to China.",
      "Having these promises from China should make it easier for farmers to get the loans they need heading into next year, but Ewoldt said \u201cI hope the administration doesn\u2019t think that this solves everything in the next 6 to 8 months or ten months.\u201d",
      "Trump had promised to offer farmers a significant aid package this fall to help them survive the trade war with China, but it's been put on hold because of the ongoing government shutdown. Rollins said that aid package is still in the works, but she promised the administration is ready to \u201cstep in the gap\u201d and address any sort of harm the trade war has caused farmers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see what the market does and we will be ready to continue to step in if in fact, we believe it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Rollins said.",
      "Kurt Campbell, a former deputy secretary of state in the Biden administration and now chairman of The Asia Group, said it's not surprising that Trump negotiated these soybean purchases because they will benefit one of his core constituencies in rural America.",
      "\u201cIts key deliverables appear to be things that matter greatly to President Trump in the short term, notably progress on fentanyl and increased sales of soybeans from congressional districts that matter to the Republican party,\u201d Campbell said.",

      "The moon's orbit around the Earth isn't a perfect circle, so it gets nearer and farther as it swings around. A so-called supermoon happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA.",
      "November's supermoon is the second of three supermoons this year and also the closest: The moon will come within just under 222,000 miles (357,000 kilometers) of Earth.",
      "Tides may be slightly higher during a supermoon because the moon is closer to Earth, said astronomer Lawrence Wasserman with Lowell Observatory. But the difference isn't very noticeable.",
      "No special equipment is needed to view the supermoon if clear skies permit. But the change in the moon's size can be tough to discern with the naked eye.",

      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive world of animal research",
      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.",
      "Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled \u201clive monkeys\u201d into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.",
      "Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the driver's name, the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.",
      "The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.",
      "\u201cWhen a truck carrying 21 monkeys crashes on a public highway, the community has a right to know who owned those animals, where they were being sent, and what diseases they may have been exposed to and harbored simply by being caught up in the primate experimentation industry,\u201d said Lisa Jones-Engel, senior science adviser on primate experimentation with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.",
      "\u201cIt is highly unusual \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that Tulane refuses to identify its partner in this shipment,\u201d Jones-Engel added.",
      "Transporting research animals typically requires legally binding contracts that prevent the parties involved from disclosing information, Tulane University said in a statement to The Associated Press. That's done for the safety of the animals and to protect proprietary information, the New Orleans-based university said.",
      "\u201cTo the best of Tulane\u2019s knowledge, the 13 recovered animals remain in the possession of their owner and are en route to their original destination,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The crash has drawn a range of reactions \u2014 from conspiracy theories that suggest a government plot to sicken people to serious responses from people who oppose experimenting on animals.",

      "The Mississippi crash is one of at least three major monkey escapes in the U.S. over the past four years.",

Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, set up traps to capture them. However, some spent two months that winter living in the woods and weathering a rare snowstorm. By late January, the last four escapees were recaptured after being lured back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "In January 2022, several cynomolgus macaque monkeys escaped when a truck towing a trailer of about 100 of the animals collided with a dump truck on a Pennsylvania highway, authorities said. The monkeys were headed to a quarantine facility in an undisclosed location after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on a flight from Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, authorities said. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of the animals were accounted for within about a day, though three were euthanized for undisclosed reasons.",

      "GYEONGJU, South Korea -- Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia plans to supply hundreds of thousands of its graphics processing units for projects with South Korean businesses and the government to advance the country\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure and technologies.",
      "The plan was announced Friday by the government, Nvidia, and some of South Korea\u2019s biggest companies, including chipmakers Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and auto giant Hyundai Motor, after President Lee Jae Myung met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.",
      "At a news conference, Huang said he hopes to export Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI chips to China, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on loosening U.S. chip restrictions as the two leaders pledged to reduce trade tensions.",
      "However, he acknowledged that it was up to Trump to decide, and said there were no current plans to sell the next generation Blackwell chips to China.",
      "Huang has gotten rockstar treatment reminiscent of Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs since arriving in South Korea on Thursday to attend meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Gyeongju. As APEC host, South Korea is using the gathering of world leaders to showcase its ambitions in AI.",
      "According to Lee\u2019s office and the companies, Nvidia will supply around 260,000 GPUs to support South Korea\u2019s AI computing and manufacturing capabilities.",
      "About 50,000 of the GPUs will be used to support a government project to build a national cloud computing center for AI and Nvidia will provide the same number of GPUs each to Samsung and SK to help them enhance their manufacturing processes through AI and accelerate the development of advanced semiconductors.",
      "Hyundai and Nvidia said they plan to collaborate on developing technologies related to self-driving cars, smart factories and robotics, a process that will be powered by 50,000 of Nvidia\u2019s advanced Blackwell GPUs.",
      "Speaking to business leaders, Huang highlighted how AI and advanced computing are driving a profound transformation across industries, adding to the need for more infrastructure and capacity. South Korea\u2019s strengths in software, technical expertise and manufacturing give it an edge, he said.",
      "\u201cWhen you combine software, AI technology, and manufacturing, you have the opportunity to really take advantage of robotics,\u201d which is the future of AI, Huang said.",

Trump and former President Joe Biden have imposed restrictions on China\u2019s access to the most advanced chips, including those used for AI. Trump said China will speak with Nvidia about purchasing their chips, but not the company\u2019s latest Blackwell AI chips.",
      "Nvidia has argued that U.S. export controls hinder American competitiveness in one of the world\u2019s largest technology markets and warned that such limits could push other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology. Talking to reporters in South Korea, Huang said he hopes to eventually sell Blackwell chips to China, \u201cbut that\u2019s a decision for the president to make.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re always hoping to return to China,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the best interest of the United States, it\u2019s in the best interests of China. And so I\u2019m hopeful that both governments will arrive at a conclusion someday where Nvidia\u2019s technology could be exported to China.\u201d",
      "Huang acknowledged U.S. security concerns about Nvidia technology being used by China\u2019s military but argued that China already has ample AI capabilities, making the use of Nvidia chips for military purposes largely unnecessary.",
      "In August, Trump announced a deal with Nvidia and AMD, another chipmaker, to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns among national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.",
      "Nvidia earlier this week confirmed that it has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the company broke through the $4 trillion mark. The milestone underscores the upheaval driven by the AI craze, widely seen as the biggest technological shift since Apple co-founder Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.",
      "But there are also concerns over a potential AI bubble. Officials at the Bank of England warned earlier this month that tech stock prices fueled by the AI boom could collapse, and the head of the International Monetary Fund has issued a similar warning.",

The tech executives clinked glasses, took bomb shots, and at one point, Huang stepped outside to hand baskets of chicken and fried cheese to the crowd waiting outside.",
      "The three later took the stage before hundreds of cheering fans at a nearby gaming festival, where Huang said Korea\u2019s gaming scene aided Nvidia\u2019s early success back when it mainly made graphics cards for gamers.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple's iPhone sales growth decelerated during its summertime quarter, but the company still delivered financial results that exceeded analyst projections while the trendsetting company continued to catch up to its Big Tech peers in the artificial intelligence race.",
      "The performance announced Thursday was driven largely by strong initial demand for the premium models of the iPhone 17 lineup that went on sale last month.",
      "Although the iPhone 17 lacks the AI wizardry featured in rival devices recently introduced by Samsung and Google, Apple spruced up its latest models with a redesign highlighted by a sleek \u201cliquid glass\u201d appearance on the display screens.",
      "Apple also largely maintained its pricing on its latest iPhones, despite being squeezed by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war that imposed tariffs on the U.S. devices that the company mostly makes in India and China.",
      "The formula apparently was enough to win over consumers, particularly in the United States, and deliver iPhone sales totaling $49 billion during the July-September period, a 6% from the same time last year. That was slightly below the 8% increase in iPhone sales that had been anticipated by analysts, and less than the 13% bump in sales during the April-June period.",
      "Buoyed by the iPhone results, Apple earned $27.5 billion, or $1.85 per share, nearly doubling its profit from a year ago. Revenue climbed 8% from a year ago to $102.5 billion. Both the earnings and revenue eclipsed the analyst forecasts that steer the stock market.",

      "Apple had promised a wide array of AI features would be rolling out on last year\u2019s iPhone models, but was only able to deliver a few of them. The missing upgrades included a smarter and more versatile version of its frequently flummoxed Siri virtual assistant \u2013 a makeover that Apple now doesn\u2019t expect to complete until next year.",
      "But Apple has a long history of late starts when technology starts to head in another direction before it finally catches up and emerges as a front-runner.",
      "If Apple can pull it off again by eventually implanting more AI features on the iPhone, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes those breakthroughs could boost the company\u2019s market share by another $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, translating into $75 to $100 per share.",

      "Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute are developing tiny drones inspired by bats for search and rescue missions",
      "WORCESTER, Mass. -- Don't be fooled by the fog machine, spooky lights and fake bats: the robotics lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute lab isn't hosting a Halloween party.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s a testing ground for tiny drones that can be deployed in search and rescue missions even in dark, smoky or stormy conditions.",
      "\u201cWe all know that when there\u2019s an earthquake or a tsunami, the first thing that goes down is power lines. A lot of times, it\u2019s at night, and you\u2019re not going to wait until the next morning to go and rescue survivors,\u201d said Nitin Sanket, assistant professor of robotics engineering. \u201cSo we started looking at nature. Is there a creature in the world which can actually do this?\u201d",
      "Sanket and his students found their answer in bats and the winged mammal's highly sophisticated ability to echolocate, or navigate via reflected sound. With a National Science Foundation grant, they\u2019re developing small, inexpensive and energy-efficient aerial robots that can be flown where and when current drones can\u2019t operate.",
      "Last month, emergency workers in Pakistan used drones to find people stranded on rooftops by massive floods. In August, a rescue team used a drone to find a California man who got trapped for two days behind a waterfall. And in July, drones helped find a stable route to three mine workers who spent more than 60 hours trapped underground in Canada.",
      "But while drones are becoming more common in search and rescue, Sanket and researchers elsewhere want to move beyond the manually operated individual robots being used today. A key next step is developing aerial robots that can be deployed in swarms and make their own decisions about where to search, said Ryan Williams, an associate professor at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cThat type of deployment \u2014 autonomous drones \u2014 that is effectively nil,\u201d he said.",
      "Williams tackled that problem with a recent project that involved programming drones to choose search trajectories in coordination with human searchers. Among other things, his team used historical data from thousands of missing person cases to create a model predicting how someone would behave if lost in the woods.",
      "\u201cAnd then we used that model to better localize our drones, to search in locations with higher chances of finding someone,\u201d he said.",
      "At WPI, Sanket\u2019s project addresses other limitations of current drones, including their size and perception capabilities.",
      "\u201cCurrent robots are big, bulky, expensive and cannot work in all sorts of scenarios,\u201d he said.",

      "By contrast, his drone fits in the palm of his hand, is made mostly from inexpensive hobby-grade materials and can operate in the dark. A small ultrasonic sensor, not unlike those used in automatic faucets in public restrooms, mimics bat behavior, sending out a pulse of high-frequency sound and using the echo to detect obstacles in its path.",
      "During a recent demonstration, a student used a remote control to launch the drone in a brightly lit room and then again after turning off all but a faintly glowing red light. As it approached a clear, Plexiglas wall, the drone repeatedly halted and backed away, even with the lights off and with fog and fake snow swirling through the air.",
      "\u201cCurrently, search and rescue robots are mainly operational in broad daylight,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cThe problem is that search and rescues are dull, dangerous and dirty jobs that happen a lot of times in darkness.\u201d",
      "But development didn\u2019t go completely smoothly. The researchers realized that the noise of the bat robot\u2019s propellers interfered with the ultrasound, requiring 3D printed shells to minimize the interference. They also used artificial intelligence to teach the drone how to filter and interpret sound signals.",
      "Still, there\u2019s a long way to go to match bats, which can contract and compress their muscles to listen only to certain echoes and can detect something as small as a human hair from several meters away.",
      "\u201cBats are amazing,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cWe are nowhere close to what nature has achieved. But the goal is that one day in the future, we will be there and these will be useful for deployment in the wild.\u201d",

      "A Yup'ik community near the Bering Sea in southwest Alaska was spared the widespread devastation other communities experienced from the remnants of Typhoon Halong earlier this month",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- A fragment of a mask that was preserved for hundreds of years in permafrost sat in the muck of a low tide in the western Alaska community of Quinhagak. Wooden spoons, toys, a fishing lure and other artifacts were strewn, in some cases for miles, along the beach.",
      "The Yup'ik community near the edge of the Bering Sea was spared the widespread devastation wrought by the remnants of Typhoon Halong on its neighbors further west earlier this month. But it suffered a different kind of blow: The lashing winds and storm surge devoured dozens of feet of shoreline, disrupting a culturally significant archaeological site and washing away possibly thousands of unearthed artifacts.",
      "About 1,000 pieces, including wooden masks and tools, were recovered in Quinhagak after the storm ravaged parts of southwest Alaska on Oct. 11 and 12. But many more pieces \u2014 perhaps up to 100,000 \u2014 were left scattered, said Rick Knecht, an archaeologist who has worked on the Nunalleq, or old village, project for 17 years. That's roughly the number of pieces previously recovered from the archaeological site.",
      "Meanwhile, freezing temperatures and ice have settled into the region, stalling immediate efforts to find and recover more displaced artifacts on searches done by four-wheeler and foot.",
      "Knecht called what happened a major loss. The site has yielded the world's largest collection of pre-contact Yup'ik artifacts. Much of what's known about Yup'ik life before outsiders arrived stems from the project, said Knecht, an emeritus senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.",
      "\u201cWhen there are holes or disturbances in the site, it\u2019s like trying to read a book with holes in the pages. You're going to miss a few things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bigger those holes are, the weaker the story gets. There\u2019s a few holes in the book right now.\u201d",
      "While the name of the original village isn't known, it was attacked by another village and burned around 1650, he said. Knecht has worked with elders and others in Quinhagak to combine their traditional knowledge with the technology and techniques used by the archaeology teams to study the past together.",
      "Quinhagak has about 800 residents, and subsistence food gathering is critically important to them.",
      "The storm dispersed artifacts from a site long preserved by permafrost, Knecht said. A longstanding concern has been the threat that climate change \u2014 melting permafrost, coastal erosion, the potential for more frequent or stronger storms \u2014 has posed to the site, he said.",
      "It poses risks to the community itself. Erosion threatens major infrastructure in Quinhagak, including a sewage lagoon, homes and fish camps. Thawing permafrost is also unsettling and undermining buildings, according to a 2024 report from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",
      "The excavation project itself began after artifacts began appearing on the beach around 2007. Part of the site that washed out had been excavated previously.",

      "When he left in July, there was a roughly 30-foot buffer to the sea. The storm took out the buffer and another 30 feet of the site, he said. It also left what Knecht described as piano-sized clumps of tundra on the tidal flats.",
      "Knecht didn't recognize the site at first after Halong.",
      "\u201cI just drove right by it because all the landmarks I\u2019m used to on the beach and at the site were gone or changed,\u201d he said.",
      "Work to preserve the rescued artifacts has included soaking the marine salts from the wood and placing the pieces in special chemicals that will help them hold together when they dry out, he said. If one were to just take one of the wooden artifacts off the beach and let them dry, they'd \u201ccrack to pieces, sometimes in a matter of hours.\u201d",
      "There is a lab at the museum in Quinhagak where the artifacts are kept.",
      "Archaeologists hope to return to the site next spring for a \u201crescue excavation\u201d of layers exposed by the storm, he said. In some ways, it feels like when teams saw the site in 2009: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this raw site with artifacts popping off in every way,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re starting from scratch again.\u201d",

      "Microsoft on Wednesday reported its quarterly sales grew 18% to $77.7 billion, beating Wall Street expectations while also surprising some investors with the huge amounts of money it is spending to expand its cloud computing infrastructure and meet demand for artificial intelligence tools.",
      "The software maker said it spent nearly $35 billion in the July-September quarter on capital expenditures to support AI and cloud demand, nearly half of that on computer chips and much of the rest related to data center real estate.",
      "That overshadowed Microsoft's report of a 22% increase in quarterly profit to $30.8 billion, or $4.13 per share, which easily beat Wall Street expectations for the period.

But shares in Microsoft then dropped in the hours before it disclosed its earnings Wednesday as the company battled an outage affecting its Azure cloud computing platform. They dropped even more \u2014 about 1% \u2014 in after-hours trading Wednesday as investors considered the significance of the earnings report.",
      "Driving investor enthusiasm on Tuesday was the announcement of Microsoft's revised business deal with its longtime partner OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT and now the world's most valuable startup. While no longer OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider, a relationship that helped bankroll the startup's early growth, Microsoft will retain commercial rights to OpenAI products through 2032 and get a roughly 27% stake in OpenAI\u2019s new for-profit arm.",

    "story": [
      "Producing and manufacturing electric vehicles and their batteries uses a lot of energy, leading many to be skeptical about the environmental benefits of going electric",
      "DETROIT -- Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.",
      "The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.",
      "The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.",
      "\u201cWhile there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you\u2019re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,\" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.",
      "The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.",
      "Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.",
      "They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest \u2014 a 31% share of vehicle sales \u2014 to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)",
      "The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.",
      "The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is \u201cnot only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,\u201d said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.",
      "Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, called it a \u201cvaluable study\u201d that echoes other findings and \u201cconfirms the environmental and economic benefits\u201d of EVs.",
      "\u201cAccelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.",
      "\u201cWhen you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody\u2019s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.\"",
      "Outside experts agreed \u2014 as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.",

But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.",

      "If it happens, the deal would mark the end of months of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China's ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law's January deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",
      "Trump\u2019s order was meant to enable an American-led group of investors to buy the app from China\u2019s ByteDance, though the deal also requires China\u2019s approval.",

Whether or not that deal will protect the data of Americans is a big question going forward.\u201d",

He thinks scientific innovation will curb it, and it\u2019s instead time for a \u201cstrategic pivot\u201d in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.",
      "A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said. In a memo released Tuesday, Gates said the world\u2019s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries.",
      "If given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, Gates told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don\u2019t understand the suffering that exists today.\u201d",
      "The Microsoft co-founder spends most of his time now on the goals of the Gates Foundation, which has poured tens of billions of dollars into health care, education and development initiatives worldwide, including combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.

      "\u201cIf you think climate is not important, you won\u2019t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won\u2019t agree with the memo,\u201d Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who\u2019s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.\u201d",
      "Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.",
      "University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi said she thoroughly agrees with Gates that the U.N. negotiations should focus on improving human health and well-being. But, she said, Gates assumes the world stays static and only one variable changes \u2014 faster deployment of green technologies \u2014 to curb climate change. She called that unlikely.",

      "Democrat wants Trump to negotiate a funding deal that fixes health care.",
      "As the negative impacts of the 33-day government shutdown compound, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said Sunday he doesn't see the present funding impasse in terms of politics, insisting what Democrats are \"focused on is the American people.\"",
      "Asked by ABC's\u00a0\"This Week\"\u00a0co-anchor Martha Raddatz what Democrats have gained since the shutdown began, Kaine said, \"Well, I don\u2019t look at this as politics.\"",
      "\"I mean, the president told the House, do a budget and, in his words, don\u2019t deal with Democrats. So, Senate Democrats put an alternative on the table 12 days before Sept. 30 that fixed the health care wreckage that the Republicans caused and that ensured that a deal would be honored, both by Congress and the White House. The president refused to meet until the day before the deadline,\" Kaine continued. \"The guy's unserious.\"",
      "Raddatz followed up to press Kaine: \"Not talking about politics. What have Democrats gained during this period? And how long can this last?\"",
      "\"I'm a United States senator,\" Kaine said. \"And I -- yes, I run as a Democrat, and I'm a Democrat, but I just don't approach my work that way. So, when you ask what Democrats have gained, what we're -- what we're focused on is the American people. We want President Trump to stop firing people, canceling economic development projects. We want them to stop raising everybody's costs.\"",
      "Kaine said Democrats want Trump to \"simply sit down\" and negotiate a \"budget deal that puts us on a path to a health care fix.\"",
      "As the shutdown drags on, neither side has moved much from their initial stances. The Democrats continue to insist on health care priorities, including an extension of expiring tax credits for millions of Americans who get health insurance via the Affordable Care Act. The Republicans and White House continue to insist the only viable option is to pass the short-term funding bill that would fund the government through Nov. 21 and has failed to pass 13 times in the Senate.",
      "Americans are now learning just how much their health care premiums would increase next year if these tax credits aren't extended. But the consequences of the shutdown are also becoming more apparent: air traffic controllers are increasingly calling out sick leading to delays and ground stops, and the critical SNAP food assistance program is now in limbo after a judge ruled the administration must continue to fund the program, despite the administration claiming it legally cannot.",

Abigail Spanberger, our candidate, three pillars to her campaign: affordability, jobs, and education, which is about kids, but also about our workforce. Her opponent is running ads on offbeat cultural issues that don\u2019t really matter to most people. In Virginia, Democrats focus on the economy, winning the economic arguments, delivering economic results. And that\u2019s why the state has moved from red to blue so dramatically since 2000.",

      "For President Donald Trump, tariffs \u2014 or the threat of them \u2014 can bend nations to his will",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump sees tariffs \u2014 or the threat of them \u2014 as a powerful tool to bend nations to his will.",
      "He has used them in an unprecedented way, not only as the underpinning of his economic agenda, but also as the cornerstone of his foreign policy in his second term.",
      "He has wielded the import taxes as a threat to secure ceasefiresfrom countries at war. He has used them to browbeat nations into promising to do more to stop people and drugs from flowing across their borders. He has used them, in Brazil\u2019s case, as political pressure because its judicial system prosecuted a former leader who was a Trump ally, and in a recent blowup with Canada, as punishment for a television ad.",
      "This week, the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the Republican president has overstepped federal law with many of his tariffs. A ruling against him could limit or even take away that swift and blunt leverage that much of his foreign policy has relied on.",
      "Trump increasingly has expressed agitation and anxiety about the looming decision in a case he says is one of the most important in U.S. history.",
      "He has said it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the United States if the justices fail to overturn lower court rulings that found he went too far in using an emergency powers law to put his tariffs in place. Trump has suggested he may take the highly unusual step of attending the arguments in person.",
      "The Justice Department, in its defense of the tariffs, has highlighted the expansive way Trump has used them, arguing that the trade penalties are part of his power over foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not second-guess the president.",
      "Earlier this year, two lower courts and most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that Trump did not have power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to set tariffs \u2014 a power the Constitution grants to Congress. Some dissenting judges on the court, though, said the 1977 law allows the president to regulate imports during emergencies without specific limitations.",
      "The courts left the tariffs in place while the Supreme Court considers the issue. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to wield them as he has tried to pressure or punish other countries on matters related \u2014 and unrelated -- to trade.",
      "\u201cThe fact of the matter is that President Trump has acted lawfully by using the tariff powers granted to him by Congress in IEEPA to deal with national emergencies and to safeguard our national security and economy,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to ultimate victory on this matter with the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Modern presidents have used financial sanctions such as freezing assets or blocking trade, not tariffs, for their foreign policy and national security aims, said Josh Lipsky, a former Obama White House and State Department staffer who is now the international economics chair at the Atlantic Council.",
      "There are other laws that presidents can use to impose tariffs. But they require a monthslong process to justify the rates.",
      "Trump, citing the IEEPA, moves faster and more dramatically. He signs executive orders imposing new rates and fires off social media posts threatening additional import taxes, as he did in late October when he was angered by an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario.",
      "\u201cPresidents have typically treated tariffs as a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,\u201d Lipsky said.",
      "In contrast, Trump has used tariffs as the backbone of his national security and foreign policy agenda, Lipsky said. \u201cAll of it is interconnected and tariffs are at the heart of it,\u201d he said.",
      "For example, earlier this year Trump had threatened a 30% tariff on European imports, a major increase from 1.2% before he took office. Seeking to secure Trump's support for the NATO military alliance and for security guarantees for Ukraine in its war with Russia, the European Union struck a deal to settle for 15% tariffs.",

      "Trump\u2019s tariff strong-arming has rattled relationships with America\u2019s friends and foes. Some have responded by becoming more protectionist or looking to foster relations with China, which has tried to be seen as a promoter of free trade.",

      "Tariffs traditionally have been used just as a tool to address trade practices.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s literally no precedent for the manner that President Trump is using them,\u201d said Emily Kilcrease, who was a deputy assistant U.S. trade representative and earlier worked on trade issues at the National Security Council as a career civil servant during the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations,",
      "\u201cThe use of tariffs the way that President Trump is using them is like \u2014 just broadscale attack on an economy as a way to incentivize a foreign government to change their posture,\u201d said Kilcrease, now a director at the Center for a New American Security think tank.",
      "But she said the case is not clear-cut. Kilcrease said she thinks there is a \u201cdecent chance\u201d the Supreme Court could side with Trump because IEEPA gives the president \u201cbroad, flexible emergency powers.\u201d",
      "The case is also coming before a Supreme Court that has thus far been reluctant to check to Trump\u2019s wide-ranging use of executive powers.",
      "If the court constrains Trump, it could leave foreign governments questioning whether to try to renegotiate trade agreements recently struck with the Trump administration, experts said. But there are political realities at play too, because reneging on deals could affect other foreign policy or economic priorities.",
      "The administration could pivot to try to use other laws to justify the tariffs, though that could mean a more complex and bureaucratic process, Kilcrease said.",
      "\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t take tariffs off the table,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just makes them a little bit slower.\u201d",

      "States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data.",
      "While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet.",
      "Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown.",
      "In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary.",
      "Minnesota\u2019s energy assistance program is processing applications but the state\u2019s Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients\u2019 heating bills until the shutdown ends.",
      "\u201cAs temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,\u201d the agency said. The program services 120,000 households, both homeowners and renters, that include many older adults, young children and people with disabilities.",
      "Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves.",
      "\u201cThe situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,\u201d said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year.",

      "The nation\u2019s largest police fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks is set to begin patrolling the streets of Las Vegas in November",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The nation's largest police fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks is set to begin patrolling the streets of Las Vegas in November thanks to a donation from a U.S. tech billionaire, raising concerns about the blurring of lines between public and private interests.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the future of policing,\u201d Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said during a recent press conference, surrounded by the Cybertrucks while drones hovered overhead and a police helicopter circled above him.",
      "The fleet of 10 black-and-white Cybertrucks of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department with flashing lights and sirens are wrapped with the police department\u2019s logo. About 400 officers have been trained to operate the trucks that will use public charging stations.",
      "The all-electric vehicles are equipped with shotguns, shields and ladders and additional battery capacity to better handle the demands of a police department, McMahill said.",
      "The donation has raised concerns from government oversight experts about private donors\u2019 influence on public departments and the boost to the Tesla brand. The department is the latest U.S. city to turn to Tesla models even as Elon Musk \u2019s electric vehicle company has faced blowback because of his work earlier in the year to advance the president\u2019s political agenda and downsize the federal government.",
      "McMahill noted the trucks will help keep officers safer because they are bulletproof, while Metro\u2019s other squad cars are not. Each Cybertruck is valued at somewhere between $80,000 and $115,000 and will be used to respond to calls like barricades and shootings in addition to regular patrols.",
      "The Cybertrucks also offer unique benefits such as a shorter turn radius, he said.",
      "\u201cThey look a little bit different than the patrol cars that we have out there, but they represent something far bigger than just a police car,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cThey represent innovation. They represent sustainability, and they represent our continued commitment to serve this community with the best tools that we have available, safely, efficiently and responsibly.\u201d",
      "The fleet comes amid a roller coaster year for Tesla that has dealt with multiple recalls.",
      "In March, U.S. safety regulators recalled virtually all Cybertrucks on the road.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s recall, which covered more than 46,000 Cybertrucks, warned that an exterior panel that runs along the left and right side of the windshield can detach while driving, creating a dangerous road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash. Tesla offered to replace the panels free of charge in notification letters sent out in May.",
      "In late October, Tesla announced another recall of more than 63,000 Cybertrucks in the U.S. because the front lights are too bright, which may cause a distraction to other drivers and increase the risk of a collision.",
      "Las Vegas officer Robert Wicks with the department\u2019s public information office said all of Tesla\u2019s recalls will have been dealt with before the Cybertrucks patrol the streets. The March recall regarding panel issues was handled before the department received the trucks, he said.",
      "Federal regulators also have opened yet another investigation into Tesla\u2019s self-driving feature after dozens of incidents in which the cars ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.",
      "The Cybertrucks modified for the Las Vegas police fleet do not have any kind of self-driving feature.",
      "Laura Martin, executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund, said the imposing trucks with their sharp angles \u201cseems like they\u2019re designed for intimidation and not safety.\"",

      "In this case, the donation is a physical piece of equipment, and the money can\u2019t be diverted to something else, Obayashi said. That said, he doesn\u2019t think the trucks provide the department with a specific advantage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be really any distinct or noticeable advantage or benefits, so to speak, other than the fact that it\u2019s a free vehicle and it saves the taxpayers money to replace equipment,\u201d Obayashi said.",

      "In the New York borough of the Bronx, about 200 more people than usual showed up at the World of Life Christian Fellowship International pantry, many bundled in winter hats and coats and pushing collapsible shopping carts as they waited in a line that spanned multiple city blocks. Some arrived as early as 4 a.m. to choose from pallets of fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, juice, dry goods and prepared sandwiches.",
      "Mary Martin, who volunteers at the pantry, also relies on it regularly for food to supplement her SNAP payments.

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- More than 100 people followed Aztec dancers through an arch of paper flowers into El Colegio High School on Saturday morning to visit altars that students had created to commemorate D\u00eda de Muertos or Day of the Dead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s ... a way of greeting our ancestors into our homes, back into our lives, even if they\u2019re like not here physically, but spiritually,\u201d said Daniela Rosales, a senior at the small, bilingual school in Minneapolis. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of just having the community come all together and knowing that in some way they might feel safe.\u201d",
      "These crucial religious, family and community celebrations for most Mexicans and many other Latin Americans have taken on special significance this year in U.S. Latino communities, as the Trump administration escalates immigration enforcement raids, including in Minnesota.",

      "The holiday's balance of joyful remembrance and a renewed sense of presence distinguishes it from both the outright party atmosphere of Halloween and the somber memorials of the Christian holy days of All Saints on Nov. 1 and All Souls\u2019 Day on Nov. 2.",
      "In fact, Day of the Dead evolved over centuries from Indigenous practices across the Americas, and only settled on these fall dates after Catholicism was introduced, said Cary Cordova, a University of Texas professor.",
      "Different regions mark it with unique details, but the crucial element is paying homage to the dead with \u201cofrendas,\u201d festive offerings of food, drinks, music and pastimes favorite by the dead. Their souls, many believe, return for a visit, guided by the candles and marigold flowers that mark the path to the ofrendas.",
      "Whether in his Mexican childhood or today in Mankato, Luis Alberto Orozco said the key is to commemorate by \u201chaving fun as they would be\u201d \u2014 with the departed\u2019s favorite snacks and songs.",

      "As the emcee of this year's celebration, Orozco reflected on tense conversations in recent months about whether the event in Mankato might draw immigration enforcement raids, especially as rumors spread on social media.",
      "\u201cWe decided we were not going to be afraid. It was important for us to keep our faith,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I got to the event and saw all the people smile, all the fears went away.\u201d",

      "A small company in Vermont that specializes in women's cycling apparel is at the center of the fight over President Donald Trump's contentious tariff policy",
      "BURLINGTON, Vt. -- From the moment President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on nearly every country, Nik Holm feared the company he leads might not survive.",
      "Terry Precision Cycling has made it 40 years with a product line specifically for women, navigating a tough early market, thin profit margins and a pandemic-era boom and bust. But Holm, the company president, wasn\u2019t sure how his operation could pay the tariffs first announced in April and stay in business.",
      "\u201cWe felt like our backs were up against the wall,\u201d he said, explaining why he joined a lawsuit challenging the tariffs that the Supreme Court will hear next week.",
      "Terry Precision Cycling\u2019s offices are tucked behind a Burlington, Vermont, coffee shop on a leafy street that bursts into color in the fall. Local accolades share wall space with bike saddles and a color wheel's worth of fabric samples. Orders are shipped out from a warehouse a few miles away.",
      "It seems an unlikely epicenter for the furor over Trump\u2019s tariffs playing out on the trading floors of global market exchanges and in the boardrooms of international corporations.",
      "But Terry Precision Cycling is one of a handful of small businesses that are challenging many of Trump's tariffs Wednesday before the Supreme Court in a case with extraordinary implications for the boundaries of presidential power and for the global economy.",
      "The company is small, but it works with suppliers around the world. It sells cycling shorts manufactured in the U.S. using materials imported from France, Guatemala and Italy. Its distinctive, colorfully printed bike jerseys are made with high-tech material that can't be found outside of China.",
      "Tariffs mean the company has to pay more for all those imports, and without the cash reserves of a big company, it has few choices to make up the shortfall besides raising prices for customers. The bewildering pace of changes in tariffs, especially on goods from China, has made setting prices more like rolling the dice. \u201cIf we don\u2019t know the rules of the game, how are we supposed to play?\u201d Holm asked.",
      "The company had to add $50 to one pair of shorts in the pipeline when China tariffs hit 145%, bringing the price to $199. \u201cName the cost and we can name the price, and then we can backtrack to see who can actually afford it,\u201d Holm said.",
      "The other companies in the lawsuit he joined are also small businesses, including a plumbing supply company in Utah, a wine importer from New York and a fishing-tackle maker in Pennsylvania.",
      "Holm started working for the company more than a decade ago, taking up cycling in earnest alongside the job. He often rides his bike to work and props it outside his office, alongside the company's designers and salespeople. A thin man with deep-set eyes and side-parted hair, Holm was named president about two years ago as the company started by women's cycling pioneer Georgena Terry was wrestling with a downturn in the outdoor market after the coronavirus pandemic. His normally level demeanor gets animated when he talks about the design of their padded shorts or the level of SPF protection in the jerseys.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about fit and function, and feeling safe and comfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our foundation, getting people, getting women, riding. More butts on bikes and getting out there.\u201d",
      "The businesses challenging Trump's tariffs are represented by Liberty Justice Center, a libertarian-leaning legal group usually more aligned with conservative causes. But they say Trump is wrong on sweeping tariffs, which are projected to collect a total of some $3 trillion from businesses over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "They argue the president is using an emergency powers law that doesn't even mention tariffs to claim nearly unlimited powers to impose and change import duties at will, something no other president has done on such a scale.",
      "\u201cIt is practically what the American Revolution was fought over, the principle that taxation is not legitimate unless it is adopted by the representatives of the people,\u201d said Jeffrey Schwab, an attorney with the Liberty Justice Center.",
      "The Trump administration said the law lets the president regulate importation, and that includes tariffs. The president has been vocal about the case, suggesting at one point he might go to the arguments himself \u2014 something no other sitting president is recorded to have done. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the most important cases in the history of our country because if we don\u2019t win that case, we will be a weakened, troubled financial mess for many, many years to come,\u201d he said.",

The court found that the law didn\u2019t clearly give Biden the power to enact such a costly program.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs, by contrast, are expected to total in the trillions. They\u2019re also projected to increase people\u2019s bills by about $2,000 per household this year, an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab found.",
      "Revenue from tariffs totaled $195 billion by September, more than double what it was the year before \u2014 though the government could have to pay back that money if the justices strike down the tariffs.",
      "Trump has acknowledged that Americans could feel some short-term pain from tariffs but maintained that they\u2019ll bring about more favorable trade deals and help American manufacturing. His administration says the tariffs are different from the Biden student-loan case because they're about foreign affairs, an area where it says the courts should not be second-guessing the president.",
      "For the people at Terry Precision Cycling, though, those big-picture political questions were far from their decision to join the lawsuit. Holm thought more about the company's 20 or so employees, its legacy and the women who buy its products out of a love for cycling.",
      "\u201cIf it becomes so unaffordable for them to do it, less can enter into that joy, that freedom of being on a bike,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about surviving this uncertainty.\u201d",

      "Lightfoot was inspired to write his ode to the Fitzgerald and the 29 men who died on board after reading the first Associated Press story about the wreck and a Nov. 24, 1975, article in Newsweek magazine. The song was released in August 1976, less than a year later.",
      "Lightfoot's mournful storytelling propelled the tragedy into infamy. Affection for the song and interest in the wreck has sustained for half a century, though it wasn't even the deadliest recorded on the Great Lakes. The deadliest wreck on open waters was the Lady Elgin in 1860, which historians estimate killed nearly 400 people.",
      "\u201cThe song has made this by far the most famous Great Lakes shipwreck,\u201d said John U. Bacon, author of \u201cThe Gales of November,\u201d a recently published book coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the wreck. He said the Edmund Fitzgerald trails only the Titanic and possibly the Lusitania as the most famous shipwreck in the world.",
      "Rick Haynes, 80, played bass on the single and in Lightfoot\u2019s band for 55 years. He said the first recorded take of the song was what they released on the album \u201cSummertime Dream.\u201d",

      "Former President Barack Obama is headlining rallies for Democrats running for governor in Virginia and New Jersey",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Former President Barack Obama will headline rallies Saturday for Democrats running for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, corralling voters ahead of elections that may signal the national mood 10 months into Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency and a year ahead of midterm elections that could reshape it.",
      "Republicans in those states are stumping as well on the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's elections, but without the national star power.",
      "And on the west coast, California advocates are making a final push ahead of a statewide referendum over whether to redraw the state's congressional map in Democrats' favor. The effort backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom is part of a national redistricting battle that began when Trump urged GOP-run states to help him keep a friendly House majority in 2026.",
      "Obama, the Democrat whom Trump succeeded when he first assumed the presidency, will appear first Saturday with Virginia\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk. Obama then travels to New Jersey for an evening rally with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill in Newark. Both events put the nation's first Black president in areas where Black voter turnout is key for Democratic victories.",
      "Virginia Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, and New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker, have busy itineraries, as well.",
      "The Virginia contest ensures the election of the first woman to lead the Commonwealth since its 1776 founding. If elected, Earle-Sears would be the first Black woman elected governor of any state.",
      "Democratic Virginia House Speaker Don Scott brushed off questions about whether Obama was needed to help turn out Black voters who are key to Democrats' coalition of voters, saying his popularity spans racial lines.",
      "\u201cBlack folks and white folks are inspired by his leadership. They\u2019re inspired by the way that he governed himself,\u201d said Scott, Virginia's first Black state House speaker.",
      "Obama\u2019s campaign swing affirms how popular the 64-year-old remains among his party\u2019s base more than eight years removed from the White House. Yet it underscores Democrats' lack of current top leaders and surrogates, with Republicans holding all levers of federal power and a cadre of Democratic governors and lawmakers vying for status as national figures.",
      "And, Scott's protests aside, the visit highlights pressure on Democrats to maximize their diverse coalition after Trump chipped away in 2024 at Democrats' usual advantages among Black and Hispanic voters. Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey but narrowed the margins in both states from his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Republicans believe New Jersey, especially, is ripe to continue that trend for Ciattarelli.",
      "Trump endorsed Ciattarelli and has said \u2014 without naming Earle-Sears \u2014 that he backs the GOP candidate for Virginia governor. The president conducted a phone rally for Ciattarelli. He has not campaigned in person for either nominee, despite traveling multiple times in recent months to his golfing resort in New Jersey.",
      "That reflects the tightrope Republicans must walk: Trump remains intensely popular among the most conservative voters but has a more precarious standing with the rest of the electorate.",
      "Spanberger and Sherrill have tried to capitalize.",
      "\u201cJack won\u2019t say one bad word about the president,\u201d Sherrill charged in a debate with Ciattarelli.",

      "They've pledged to tackle rising consumer costs and blasted Trump for failing to reduce prices as he promised in the 2024 campaign. In New Jersey, however, Ciattarelli has blamed Democrats for higher energy costs because outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy has been leading the state for two terms.",
      "The Democratic candidates have blasted the Republicans' federal domestic policy and tax cut bill. In Virginia, Spanberger has highlighted Trump's Department of Government Efficiency and, to a lesser degree, the ongoing federal shutdown \u2014 both of which have a disproportionate impact in a state that has more than 300,000 federal employees, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Earle-Sears has tried to pin the shutdown on Spanberger, arguing the former congresswoman should use her leverage with Virginia's Democratic U.S. senators. Both senators have voted against the GOP's spending extension bill as Democrats demand Republicans address looming health care cuts.",
      "Additionally, the contests could offer some clues as to whether social issues carry any less weight with voters than in previous elections. Spanberger and Sherrill herald their support for abortion rights, Spanberger doing so in the last Southern state to make the procedure widely accessible. Earle-Sears counters with a focus on transgender policies, trying to frame Spanberger as out of step with mainstream voters in the same way Trump used the issue against Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024.",
      "While results in Virginia and New Jersey will be mere guideposts for the 2026 midterms, California stands to have the most immediate impact on the national landscape.",
      "Voters there are deciding whether to override a nonpartisan redistricting commission and approve a new congressional map that is intended to send five more Democrats to Washington.",
      "It's a direct counter to neutralize Texas' plan, already approved, that was drawn to tilt five seats in that state to the Republican column. And more states have followed suit, putting the national map itself in flux in an unprecedented mid-decade scramble years after the usual post-census redistricting process.",
      "Republicans began the current Congress with just a 220-215 advantage in the House. That means just a few seats could determine whether Trump enjoys outright GOP control in Washington for the duration of his presidency or faces a new Democratic majority that, if patterned after his first term, blocks his agenda, opens an investigation of his administration and considers articles of impeachment.",

In recent years, the celebration has become more commercialized, leaving many in the community wondering how to preserve the centuries-old tradition while evolving to keep it alive.",
      "Day of the Dead is traditionally an intimate family affair, observed with home altars \u2014 ofrendas \u2014 and visits to the cemetery to decorate graves with flowers and sugar skulls. They bring their deceased loved ones\u2019 favorite foods and hire musicians to perform their favorite songs.",

But with \u2018Coco,\u2019 that movie really thrust it into mainstream popular culture.\u201d",

      "The colorful altars have been part of Mexican and Mesoamerican culture since the Spanish arrived and converted Mexico's Indigenous tribes to Catholicism.

      "The final stretch of New York City's mayoral race has candidates Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo painting two very different pictures",
      "NEW YORK -- In his final ad of the New York City mayoral race, Andrew Cuomo opens on a dour note: \u201cLife in New York is tough right now.\"",
      "Then comes a dig at Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee who the former governor has argued is too inexperienced to lead the city: \u201cCandidates who need on-the-job training can\u2019t fix it,\" he says.",
      "In their last days on the campaign trail before Election Day on Tuesday, Cuomo, Mamdani and Republican Curtis Sliwa are offering their closing arguments to voters.",
      "For Cuomo, 67, it's a message that voters must stop Mamdani from leading the city into ruin, casting himself as the only one who can keep the city safe and move it forward.",
      "Meanwhile, Mamdani is trying to keep riding the wave of progressive excitement that carried him to victory in June's primary \u2014 while weathering the final barrage of attacks from Cuomo and other critics wary of giving a 34-year-old democratic socialist the reins to America\u2019s biggest city.",
      "With early voting concluding Sunday, he's shaking hands with everyone form social media influencers to airport taxi drivers as he urges his supporters not to grow complacent. \u201cPeople say \u2018We got this. It\u2019s over. Cuomo is cooked,'\u201d he says in one of his many popular online videos. \u201cDo not believe it.\u201d",
      "And Sliwa is running an aggressive ground-level campaign of his own, hitting the city\u2019s subways and streets with his public safety-focused pitch and a warning that his Democratic opponents are \u201ctwo sides of the same coin.\u201d",
      "Cuomo, a Democrat on the ballot as an independent, has spent the final stretch working to convince Republicans he is a more viable candidate than Sliwa.",
      "He has met with Jewish and Muslim leaders. There have been an array of media hits on traditional news channels but also appearances on shows hosted by YouTuber-turned-boxer-turned-pro wrestler Logan Paul as well as Stephen A. Smith, a commentator on sports and politics.",
      "Much of the former governor's pitch has been marked by dark warnings of social and economic collapse if Mamdani were to win, along with assurances that his record as governor makes him a more suitable choice.",
      "In an interview this week on Fox Business, Cuomo said Mamdani, who was born in Uganda to parents of Indian descent but grew up in New York City, \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand the New York culture.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans, there are two choices, me or Mamdani. Don\u2019t waste your vote,\" Cuomo said.",

      "\u201cNormally, I would say, \u2018Ease up.\u2019 You\u2019re both running for mayor. You both care about the city, so you know, just state your message,\u201d Paterson said. \u201cIn this case, the reason he\u2019s doing it is that that message hasn\u2019t filtered in yet.\u201d",

      "The Pentagon has rolled out a new policy that will severely undercut the ability for transgender troops who have been banned from the armed forces by the Trump administration to turn to boards of their peers to argue for their right to stay in the mili...",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon has rolled out a new policy that will severely undercut the ability for transgender troops who have been banned from the armed forces by the Trump administration to turn to boards of their peers to argue for their right to stay in the military, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "If military separation boards decide to allow transgender service members to remain in uniform, commanders can override that decision, according to an Oct. 8 memo to all the services from the Pentagon\u2019s undersecretary for personnel and readiness, Anthony Tata. That breaks with longstanding policy that boards act independently.",
      "It is the Pentagon\u2019s latest step to drive transgender troops out of the armed forces following an executive order from President Donald Trump. He and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal.",
      "The adminstration's policies have faced pushback in the courts as trans troops and their supporters say they have proven their worth to the military, but the U.S. Supreme Court in May allowed the ban to be enforced while legal challenges proceed.",
      "The new memo, which advocates say was only made available to troops last week, also sets up an additional hurdle of requiring that trans service members appear before separation boards in uniforms that match the gender assigned to them at birth \u2014 and if they fail to do so, their absence can be used against them.",
      "The policy \u2014 and specifically the uniform mandate \u2014 will force a lot of people not to be able to attend their separation board hearings, according to Emily Starbuck Gerson, a spokeswoman for SPARTA Pride, an advocacy group for transgender troops and veterans.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re already essentially being rigged with a predetermined outcome and then now you\u2019re further penalizing someone for not showing up because they can\u2019t wear the wrong uniform,\u201d Gerson added.",
      "When asked about the memo, Pentagon assistant press secretary Riley Podleski said that \u201cas a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.\"",
      "The policy follows an Air Force directive reported by The Associated Press in August, which said separation boards could not independently decide whether to keep or discharge transgender troops and instead \u201cmust recommend separation of the member\u201d if they have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria \u2014 when a person\u2019s biological sex does not match up with their gender identity.",
      "Gerson said the new policy that applies to all the services \u201cfeels very similar to what the Air Force rolled out\u201d but noted that some of the additional hurdles like the uniform mandate were \u201calarming.\u201d",
      "The October memo says, \u201cshould the Service member not conform to uniform and grooming standards, board proceedings will continue with the Service member in absentia and may, as appropriate, take the Service member\u2019s failure to comply with standards intro consideration when determining whether the basis for separation has been established.\u201d",
      "Many transgender troops have been serving for years and likely don't own uniforms in the gender assigned to them at birth. And they say forcing them into those uniforms would feel wrong.",
      "Logan Ireland, a master sergeant in the Air Force with 15 years of service, said he has been seen as a man for most of his adult life and for almost 13 years of his military service.",
      "\u201cIt would be a betrayal of what the military has seen me as,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit would be like a costume-like effect.\u201d",

      "Gerson, the advocate, says the new policy seems to run counter to the ideal of a merit-based military that Hegseth has touted.",
      "\"It does not account for the service member's career history, accomplishments, training and the necessity to their field,\u201d she said.",
      "Ireland also noted that the policy \"denies us the dignity and respect we were promised as we are forced out of a service that once honored our contributions.\u201d",
      "The boards traditionally offer troops who are facing separation from the military a chance at a quasi-legal hearing to determine if that service member still has value to the military and should stay on. Fellow service members hear evidence of whatever wrongdoing occurred and about the person\u2019s character, fitness and performance.",
      "While not a formal court hearing, it has much the same structure. Service members are often represented by lawyers, they can present evidence in their defense and they can appeal the board\u2019s findings to a federal court.",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s policy on separating officers notes that they are entitled to \u201cfair and impartial\u201d hearings that should be \u201ca forum for the officer concerned to present reasons the contemplated action should not be taken.\u201d",
      "This impartial nature means that the boards can sometimes reach surprising conclusions. For example, the commanding officer of the USS McCain, a destroyer that collided with an oil tanker in the Pacific in 2017, killing 10, was not recommended for separation in 2019.",
      "More recently, the three active duty Marines who were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were also retained.",
      "Priya Rashid, a military lawyer who has represented service members before hundreds of separation boards, said the fact that commanders can override this process for trans troops subverts justice.",
      "\u201cService members who are accused of serious misconduct, violent misconduct, sex-based misconduct ... are being afforded more due process protections and more rights and entitlements than this group of people solely based on the administrative label of gender dysphoria,\u201d she said.",

      "Venice can feel like a movie set, particularly when riding on a boat down the Grand Canal with George Clooney.",
      "Waving to fans, he's asked if that ever gets normal. \"No,\" he replied.",
      "Clooney has practice navigating this kind of attention. He's made about 50 films, picking up a couple of Academy Awards along the way (as an actor for \"Syriana,\" and as a producer for \"Argo\"). And for his latest, \"Jay Kelly,\" he plays one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 a familiar role.",
      "He says it's true that he said yes to the film within 24 hours. \"Well, I read it, and I was like, Well, if I take time to think of it, they might go get Brad. And I can't have that. I can't have that, man! When you read something, you know.\"",
      "Co-starring Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, the Netflix film \u2013 part comedy, part drama \u2013 critiques the cult of celebrity, as Clooney's character embarks on a journey to reconcile his professional success and personal failings.",
      "I asked, \"There's this kind of mind-bending experience where you're watching the film and you're wondering how much is the character and how much is George Clooney. Did you feel that making it?\"",
      "\"I really didn't,\" Clooney said. \"You know, what I know in life is you can live with failure. I tried this, it didn't work out. What you can't live with is regret. Jay Kelly is filled with regret. I mean, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I have no regrets. I've certainly made mistakes. I've certainly done some dumb things. But I took a big bite at the apple, and I really took big swings.\"",
      "\"Were there things that felt autobiographical?\"",
      "\"I mean, there's things that we would laugh about, you know, playing a guy who no one says 'no' to.\"",
      "\"And that's the case for you?\"",
      "\"Well, I designed it so that that's not the case.\"",
      "How? \"I pay people!\" he laughed. \"No, I designed it by surrounding myself with the same friends that I met when I was 20 years old \u2026 I talk to them every day.\"",
      "\"Do you go out of your way to understand that there is this perceived gap between you and others?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Clooney said. \"I didn't grow up around fame. I mean, my father was a newscaster in Cincinnati, Ohio. My aunt [Rosemary Clooney] was a famous singer, but I'd met her three times. So, when I met someone famous, I was always like, Oh my God! And so, I always try to remind people that, honest to God, this is the job that I do and that, you know, we're all fairly normal.\"",
      "\"Why is that so important to you?\" I asked.",
      "\"I think because I was raised not only that you treat everyone equally, but that everyone treats you equally as well.\"",
      "Clooney is pretty disarming, as we saw while setting up the interview. Asked if he wanted to check how he looked in the camera, he smiled: \"No, I don't care. I'm too old to give a s*** anymore.\"",
      "\"You are, for many, kind of the poster man of aging gracefully.\"",
      "\"That's why I'm wearing these glasses,\" Clooney said, \"because for the record, I have a horrible sinus infection. If I take these off ...\" He demonstrated for us. \"You see the problem?\"",
      "\"How much does aging factor in \u2026 Do you see parts changing?\"",
      "\"I see parts on my body changing,\" he replied. \"I'm like, that fell off? How'd that fall off?\"",
      "\"I didn't mean that.\"",
      "\"Oh sure, parts have changed significantly.\"",
      "He's 64 now, married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. The two juggle Hollywood glamour with social justice work through their foundation. They have eight-year-old twins, and the actor (once famously single) says family life suits him \u2013 another thing that sets him apart from this character. \"Fame, [Jay] actually does really well. And I'm kind of the opposite of that in a way.\"",
      "What do you mean? \"I feel I'm a better parent, I hope, certainly husband. And fame, if there was one of the two, that would be the one I'm least comfortable with.\"",
      "\"Wow, you seem to be quite comfortable with fame and celebrity,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, you know, you got to put on your famous outfit when you come here to do a film premiere.\"",
      "\"But you know everywhere you go, people watch you. Is it performative?\"",
      "\"Sometimes it's performative,\" Clooney replied. \"I mean, listen, you don't get caught picking your nose, you know? You have to be more aware than other people would be.\"",
      "I asked, \"You seem to have this desire to keep some things for yourself, but then you can also be very political and really stick yourself out there.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, yeah,\" Clooney said. \"I try to do it when I think I have a responsibility to it. My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you, and protect people with less power. One of the things you understand is, you can't take on every fight. You have to pick things. I worked on trying to help solve some of the problems in Darfur in the early 2000s. Failed. You fail more often than you succeed. But it doesn't mean you don't keep trying. We still work there, we're still involved.\"",
      "He also does not regret writing that opinion piece in The New York Times, urging President Biden to drop out. \"To not do it would be to say I'm not going to tell the truth,\" he said.",
      "While Clooney does not shy from public activism, he gets some help guarding his private life at the family's place in Italy: \"Italian towns adopt you, Like, people come up and say, 'Which house is George Clooney's?' They go, 'Hey, he doesn't live here, he doesn't.' They protect you.\"",
      "Right now, Clooney considers France home. \"We live on a 750-acre farm, and our kids run around. We wanted them to have something of a normal existence.\"",
      "\"And you find that on a 750-acre ranch?\"",
      "\"Well, you find it on a farm, and you find on a very small school and very sort of farming community. We found a real peace there.\"",
      "He prizes that peace. In the film, Jay Kelly is searching for what George Clooney already has: a sense of self and balance. Clooney really does seem to have it all.",
      "I said, \"If people say, What was it like being with George Clooney? One of the things I'm going to say is, well, I was sitting here sweating, and somehow he didn't seem to sweat.\"",
      "\"I don't sweat!\" Clooney laughed. \"It's a funny thing. I don't sweat much when I'm on camera, funnily enough. I don't know why. I put ice cubes under my arms!\"",
      "But like the rest of us, he still has to contend with the passing of time. \"I want to work, but I don't want to fill my life with work,\" he said. \"When I turned 60, Amal and I talked about it, and I said, 'Look, I can still play basketball with the boys, I can still hang out. But in 25 years I'll be 85. And that's a real number.'",
      "\"And things change, and it doesn't matter how many granola bars you eat; it catches you. So, we have to focus on making sure we work. We also have to have focus on spending time with the people we love. More time, because at the end of your life, you don't go, I wish I'd worked more.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:37:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The author talks about his first fiction published since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him; his own immigrant experience in the U.S.; and what happens when freedom of speech dies.",
    "story": [
      "Salman Rushdie recently turned up at a McNally Johnson bookstore near South Street Seaport in Manhattan. \"It's actually not particularly close to where I live, but I come here a lot,\" he said.",
      "He was browsing for his own books. His newest one, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" is his 23rd \u2013 a collection of short stories and novellas.",
      "Life has changed since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him. \"I think what has changed is, for public-facing things, then there has to be security in a way that there wasn't for 20 years,\" he said.",
      "On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was on stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., ready to speak, ironically about America as a safe haven for writers. A man lunged at him with a knife.",
      "His account of the attack, \"Knife,\" was published in 2024: \"I raise my left hand in self-defense. He plunges the knife into it. ... After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.\"",
      "Rushdie lost the sight in his right eye. \"I can still read,\" he said, \"but I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to. Because there's light, and because I can adjust the size of the type. So, I never, ever, read a book on an iPad, but now I do.\"",
      "His left hand and liver were badly damaged, but he lived, which he considers \"a miracle.\"",
      "In May of this year, Rushdie's attacker, Lebanese-American Hadi Matar, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors argued he was acting on the fatwa, the 1989 order by Iran's leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, to kill the author, claiming passages in his fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" insulted Islam.",
      "Recognized just for his fiction before, suddenly Rushdie was world famous (to some, infamous) for the fatwa. After nearly a decade in hiding, protected 24/7 by British security, Rushdie emerged and moved to New York, thinking times had changed. But he was wrong.",
      "Yet the author does not seem bitter or angry. \"I think that's who I am,\" he said.",
      "I suggested, \"Most people would say, well, this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have a therapist,\" Rushdie said, \"and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD. And I said, 'But I don't seem to be having those symptoms, so what's wrong with me?' And he said, 'Well, it's because you're a bad-ass, that's the technical term.'\"",
      "The new book is the first fiction he's published since the attack.",
      "So, why \"The Eleventh Hour\"? \"Well, for a start, I'm 78,\" he said. \"For another thing, I had a fairly intimate encounter with death, you know, and got away with it. But it makes you think, you know? So, I thought this idea of running out of time was something I had on the brain.\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America\"",
      "\"Now you have entered the magic space of my childhood,\" the fictional narrator of one story says, as he takes a last walk up the hill to the neighborhood where the real Salman Rushdie grew up, in Mumbai, India (which he still calls Bombay). \"My relationship with the place is kind of elegiac now,\" Rushdie said. It's a relationship about something that has passed.",
      "He left India for an English boarding school at the age of 13. He left Britain after nearly 40 years there. He became an American citizen in 2016. Rushdie sees his place in the world through the eye of an immigrant.",
      "Asked what he felt after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rushdie said, \"I remember getting into a cab, leaving the office where I'd been sworn in, and being driven back through the streets of the city, and it felt different. I thought, Oh, I can belong. And it felt very good.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did the feeling that you had when you were sworn in as a citizen become fractured or altered based on what's happened since, both in public life in the United States, and to you?\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America, but it's a hard time all over,\" he replied. \"If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less-good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.\"",
      "\"The Eleventh Hour\" includes a ghost story, characters who get even, a writer who disappears. But the book is also political. He writes: \"Words such as good and bad or right and wrong are losing their effect, emptying of meaning, and failing anymore to shape society.\"",
      "The meaning of words matters to Rushdie, who has spent his entire career advocating for free speech, even though exercising it nearly got him killed.",
      "He said, \"The final story in the collection, 'The Old Man in the Piazza,' is kind of an allegory of that. In fact, free speech, to my great surprise, language itself, turned into a character, a female character. She just walked into the story and sat down in a corner, and I hadn't expected her at all.\"",
      "\"She is in fact a very old language, one of the oldest and richest\u2026\" he writes, in a story about what happens when speech is restricted. \"It's even possible, though it's hard for her to admit this, even to herself, that she may die. Nobody's listening. Nobody cares.\"",
      "Language abandons her corner, leaving people no longer able to speak:\u00a0\"We are at a loss to know how things will proceed. Our words fail us.\"",
      "\"That's pretty startling and scary,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Rushdie agreed. \"It's supposed to be.\"",

      "\"The Eleventh Hour: A Quintet of Stories\" (to be published Tuesday by Random House) is acclaimed novelist Salman Rushie's elegiac new collection of stories \u2013 his first fiction since a 2022 attack that nearly killed him \u2013 in which he writes of intimate encounters with death, ghosts, magic, and the immutable passage of time.",

      "From \"In the South\"",
      "The day Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sun\u00adlight, the traffic's tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising up from the floor below, the pelvic thrusts of an \"item number\" dancing across a neigh\u00adbor's TV; a child's cry, a mother's rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of school\u00adgirls, the smell of strong coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot's Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.",
      "Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, of\u00adfered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or \"duels\" of the virtuosi of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.",
      "\"Be thankful we are men of the south,\" said Junior, stretch\u00ading and yawning. \"Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.\"",
      "Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not under\u00adstand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog there is no north and south. And in the second place, you're not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual\u2014but you are slow, that is beyond a doubt.\"",
      "This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance\u2014which they had come to think of as \"des\u00adtiny,\" or, as they more often called it, a \"curse\"\u2014they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by re\u00adducing it to its initial letter, V., they made the rope invisible, which did not mean it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways\u2014their voices were high, they were of similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after lifetimes of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitabil\u00adity of dentures\u2014but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together for decades.",
      "The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" got started, even though the nicknames had been in use for so long that nobody could now remember who originally thought them up. V. Senior and Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarreling to the death. They were eighty-one years old. If old age was thought of as an evening, ending in midnight oblivion, they were well into the eleventh hour.",
      "\"You look terrible,\" Junior told Senior, as he did every morn\u00ading. \"You look like a man who is only waiting to die.\"",
      "Senior\u2014nodding gravely, and also speaking in accordance with their private tradition\u2014responded, \"That is better than looking, as you do, like a man who is still waiting to live.\"",

      "K\u014cRERO: THE PAST IS THE FUTURE",
      "I'd opened my share of graves before finding something of value: a pendant in the shape of a fishhook, carved from greenstone. Greenstone only came from Aotearoa, the land our people had fled before we ended up on this island. The pendant, when held to the sun, glowed soft and green as dawn through miro trees. I was of the third generation born on this island, but the pendant was from our ancestors, from before. My father said a fishhook necklace had a special meaning: it ensured seafarers safe passage over water. To wear the pendant, I braided a cord from the inner bark of a hibiscus branch, which produced a fiber so strong, even parrots couldn't bite through it.",
      "Unpleasant as it was, and offensive to our ancestors, I was ready to open more graves.",
      "Still, I had other duties to perform. I was up each morning before dawn to hunt birds. Pigeons in planting season, t\u016b\u012b birds when the flax blossomed. This time of year, it was parrots. They arrived on our island in closely bonded flocks, and it was these social connections we'd exploit to ensnare them. When our ancestors landed on this island, it was so full of birds, they named it Manumotu, or Bird Island. If only that were still the case. These days, we'd quietly crouch all morning, ready to trigger our snares, in the hopes of catching a bird or two. The worst part was the silence. I'm the talkative type. My mother says I was born speaking, which is why she named me K\u014drero. Only after hours of silent birding was I free to open graves with my best friend Hine. The two of us could talk all day.",
      "Hine's duties, unlike mine, were endless. She'd been but a girl when her mother died and she was given to an older, childless woman named Tiri. But after a few years, when Tiri went blind, it was Hine who became the caretaker. Tiri was one of the most amazing persons in the world \u2014 I admit I only knew eighty-four people \u2014 but Hine, like me, was sixteen years old, and nobody likes it when they have to do something. And Hine had to do everything for Tiri.",
      "After birding on the morning this story begins, I arrived at our island's cove to continue digging. Many people trapped on this island before us were buried around the cove. This was considered a good resting place because of the view and the breeze and because this was where birds landed after open-water voyages. Where'd the birds come from? I always wondered. Where'd they fly off to?",
      "I tethered my parrots to a branch. One was named Aroha \u2014 it was she who lured the wild parrots into our traps. I'd tug on Aroha's tether, she'd squawk in distress, and wild parrots would come to her aid.",
      "\"I ohiti r\u0101,\" I said to Aroha. \"I ohiti p\u014d.\"",
      "This was a fisherman's adage, shortened to fit a bird's memory. Alert by day, the saying went. Alert by night. My father was a fisherman.",
      "I knew from old stories that parrots could be made to talk, though I'd had no luck at it.",
      "The other parrot was freshly caught. We'd named her Kanokano \u2014 the complications she caused are soon to be described.",
      "With only a digging stick and a basket, I picked a likely spot on the upper beach and began moving sand. If only our ancestors had thought to mark their graves. But I suppose they didn't imagine being exhumed by their great-granddaughters. I ran into a lot of mangrove roots, which I hacked with the jagged edge of a mussel shell. By the time Hine and Tiri arrived, I was sweating.",
      "\"What's the ocean like today?\" Tiri asked. Her pearled-over gaze was directed at nothing.",
      "Hine rolled her eyes and helped the old woman onto a mat before handing her her weaving.",
      "\"It's blue, it's wet,\" Hine said impatiently. \"The waves go up and down.\" I described for Tiri how late-morning light penetrated the cove, illuminating the humps of mullet, how the distant reef-break frothed like coconut pulp, how sputtering waves reached up the beach before fingering all the little shells in retreat.",
      "Hine half-heartedly stabbed at some sand with her stick.",
      "I asked, \"Did you hear the Toki brothers found an earring in a grave?\" I was arm-deep in the hole, fighting roots.",
      "\"The Toki brothers are insufferable,\" Hine said. She made a gesture to help me, but looking in the hole saw I was already to the point where smelly water was seeping in.",
      "\"The earring was greenstone,\" I said. \"From the old world. I bet one of the brothers brings it to you. Will it be the big, handsome, doltish one? Or the big, handsome, inane one?\"",
      "\"Don't make fun of me,\" Hine said. \"You'll have to marry the one I reject. And have his baby.\"",
      "The Toki brothers were slow-witted, trusting, and humorless. But their father was charismatic and funny, and the truth was, Hine had a parent-crush on him. It was quite possible that when the marriage ban was lifted, she'd marry a Toki brother just to become the daughter of Papa Toki.",
      "Tiri took a breath. She always did that before beginning a story. While Hine had no patience for the old tales, I could hear them all day. Today was the story of Paikea, who was one of the navigators who discovered Aotearoa. He was from a place called Hawaiki. Tiri didn't start in the obvious places, like Paikea's departure from Hawaiki or his arrival at Aotearoa. She didn't start with Paikea sinking a canoe and drowning his seventy enemies. Nor with him being saved by a whale. Instead, she started that epic tale with a little moment: Paikea, succumbing both to vanity and shame, as he groomed his hair with a forbidden comb.",
      "All the while, Tiri did her weaving \u2014 her fingers displaying their own kind of sight.",
      "My hole reached the point where sand fell in as fast as I scooped it out. Hine scrunched her nose. It's probably clear that Hine's heart really wasn't into digging up graves. She could barely bring herself to touch any bones, and when she did, she was afraid they might belong to her mother, even though we knew her mother was buried up the hill, above the k\u016bmara fields. We'd both been there when she was put in the ground. Still, one person's bones can look like another's, which can look like anybody's, which might as well be your mother's. I hoped Hine would change her outlook when she finally found something of value in a grave.",
      "That's when my digging stick made the unmistakable knock of wood striking bone.",
      "Tiri paused her story. I reached into the dark water and felt something in the muck. Hine winced, afraid of what I'd pull out. \"I'm sorry, ancestor,\" I said. Then, with a sucking sound, I tugged out a dog skull. I reached back for its jaw, but the mud offered only bird bones and broken shells.",
      "\"Another junk pit,\" Hine said, and started pushing sand back into the hole.",
      "I contemplated the skull. Since we'd begun digging up the dead, I'd come across many dog remains. Did they happen to die at the same time as our ancestors? Were they slain and buried alongside? Or was it something else altogether? No living person on the island had ever seen a dog, and before we started digging, it was thought that dogs had never even been here.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked.",
      "\"Another dog skull,\" Hine said. \"Look at those teeth. Who'd want to get close to one of those things, let alone share the afterlife with it?\"",
      "\"Dogs had white fur, soft as t\u016b\u012b feathers,\" Tiri said. \"The old stories say they'd lick your face.\"",
      "\"They supposedly had long tongues,\" I said, marveling at the skull. Hine shook her head. \"You don't believe every story you hear, do you?\" Hine knew that I did, indeed, believe every story I heard.",
      "\"There's only one thing we know for sure about dogs,\" Hine said. \"They must've tasted good.\"",
      "What interested me was the size of a dog's eye sockets. K\u0101k\u0101 parrots also had large eyes. In fact, the eyes of a parrot were quite intelligent and expressive. \"Ancestors are supposed to be wise,\" I said. \"But they didn't leave us a single dog.\"",
      "Hine eyed its fangs. \"I'm glad they're gone.\"",
      "\"Parrots have sharp beaks,\" I said. \"And they're friendly.\" Hine took the skull and threw it.",
      "\"One of these days, you'll lose a finger to those birds,\" she said.",
      "Already, I've forgotten some stuff. That's how bad a storyteller I am. I should've mentioned that I was absolutely forbidden from teaching my parrots human words, that Hine had a father who was alive and walking around our island \u2014 we just didn't know his identity. That Papa Toki had lost an arm, with my mother and Tiri being the ones who cut it off.",
      "But it's too late, the story's begun. Aroha looked toward the cove, spread her wings, and began screeching. We turned. Drifting in past the reef was the largest waka canoe imaginable. It had two hulls and rocked silently with the waves. Most canoes in the old stories were waka taua, war canoes. This one seemed empty \u2014 not a person or a paddle or a sail was visible. We beheld its pitched bows and soaring mast. Most ominously, the symbol of a death-bringing frigate bird was carved down its side. Then we heard it: upon the spar was a large parrot with a crimson body. It had spread its wings and was screeching back.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked. \"What's going on?\"",
      "\"We have visitors,\" Hine said. She took my hand in hers, and then she screamed.",
      "It seemed to me that, at the sound of Hine's voice, dozens of warriors would sit up in the waka and reveal themselves. I took hold of my fishhook necklace because, like the waka before me, it felt both ancient and startlingly new.",
      "Did I mention that in all our years on the island, we'd never had a visitor? As Hine's scream echoed off the cliffs, the hum of island life stopped.",
      "Silenced were the sounds of flax being beaten on the leeward shore and of our fathers excavating burial sites on the south-facing bluffs.",
      "Our fathers \u2014 all the men of Bird Island \u2014 would be here in no time.",
      "I should say the waka wasn't a total surprise. We knew something was coming. There'd been signs.",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "You are eighteen years old. Cast out by your father, shunned by society, you have fled to Geneva with your lover and your sister. The closeness of their relationship makes you furious, but if you protest, your lover will abandon you. Confined by terrible storms, you find yourself in a house with your lover, your sister and Lord Byron, an infamous and magnetically attractive poet. You know he is dangerous, but you find yourself drawn to him. When he sets a challenge to write a ghost story, all the turmoil that has boiled within you finds a voice.",
      "The anger pours from your pen in a roar of rage. Even as the monster that emerges terrifies you, you understand that it belongs to you. This creature that crawls across the page is the woman you were always meant to be. And in Byron, this furious beast that you have kept hidden for so long may have found a mate. You are eighteen years old. The creature you have created will howl its way onto page and stage and screen, burning its path across history in its desire to be seen, to be known, to be loved. The monster will never be silenced. Neither will you.",
      "Prologue",
      "Geneva, 1816",
      "At dusk, the sky over Lake Geneva is the colour of blood in a glass of water. The ash fragments falling over the city form a strange fog \u2013 a thickening of the air, which swirls through the deserted streets, past the spire of the old cathedral and over the walls of the new Protestant church. Inside, people are on their knees, praying for the uncanny cloud to lift. It is a judgement, they fear, a punishment from God, or else a curse.",
      "This night, like so many before it, the choking dust has driven the residents of the city into the shelter of shuttered houses and places of prayer. Outside, there is no one to witness the way the ash gleams as it settles on the lake. The water flickers and shimmers, each tiny filament glowing like a candle, sinking into the silence, quickly snuffed out.",
      "The lake is chill and dark and deep \u2013 not even the fishermen have fathomed its depths, or the small children who, on any other evening, would be taking turns to dive beneath the surface, competing to see who could swim down the furthest, stay under the longest.",
      "No one is standing on the lake's stony shores to watch the water's surface glow, red as the strange sky above. No one is there to see the darkness beneath the water shift and stir and coalesce, parting for a breath, like two slick thighs, which fall back into the darkness with a gasp that is almost human.",
      "Above, half masked by cloud, a thin slash of moon hangs hazy and indifferent. A lone figure stumbles down to the lake and scrambles into a small rowboat that one of the fishermen has left bobbing at the end of a long line. Looking right, then left, the man leans forward over the rope. Flash of steel from the blade in his hand. A quick tug and the boat is free. The man settles himself on the rocking boards, tugging the oars. No one will see him on this cloud-deadened, mist-muffled night. No one will stop him. Still, his breath stutters and stumbles. He must be quick. His hands ache, his chest burns. His eyes feel gritty as the mist parts before him, then closes around him, giving him the strange sensation of being swallowed.",

      "From the storeroom hidden under the stairs, Ma fetched a cup of rice and a sack of eggs speckled gray like the moon, then cooked, standing before the stove's blue fire, her eye upon the window and its dusk, in which bats swooped and the neem tree shivered and a figure down on the road pedaled a bicycle, whistling, as if everything was all right.",
      "Thief, thought Ma. Who else but a person who had chanced upon fresh vegetables or fruit would wander the city of Kolkata in this ruined year, the heat a hand clamped upon the mouth, the sun a pistol against one's head, and recall a song? She watched to see what the thief would do. He pedaled past. But Ma saw a different reality shimmer into being, in which he leaned his bicycle against the wall, climbed the pipes like a toddy tapper, and appeared at her window. In that picture, the thief was a collector of local information, dutiful in his neighborhood eavesdropping, shrewd in following what he heard about the bins of onions and carrots, the sacks of lentils and rice, the bags of raisins and cashews hidden in the dark fist of the house, stolen by Ma from donations made to the shelter where she worked, while the city outside wept for a handful of something to eat.",
      "There was \u2014 in the label accepted by the region \u2014 a shortage.",
      "In the year prior to this day, farmers across the region had fallen, their bodies running fevers in air that no longer cooled. In the croplands, among stilled machines, pests had traveled from acre to new acre, savage in their feeding of grains. In the west a drought had cleaved riverbeds and in the east salt water had tainted the paddy fields. In the city, those who walked to the neighborhood markets with umbrellas in their hands and wishful lists in their pockets, broad corners torn from the newspaper with writing in Bengali \u2014 cabbage, ginger, lychees if they were good, ice cream, half loaf of bread \u2014 found the roads alongside which the markets usually sat, its baskets and tarps invading, rickshaws and cars sounding their horns, slow shoppers inspecting the purple shine of eggplant and pressing guavas hard as hail, instead completely empty, nothing but some onion peel scattered at the edges where the pavement gave way to earth, where on most days goats and cows might have nudged the soil for something to eat. But those animals were gone too.",
      "It had happened before. 1770, when crops failed and smallpox plagued the enfeebled. 1876, when drought struck the Deccan Plateau and the British continued to export what grain remained. 1943. Those black-and-white newspaper photos, in which people appeared as sunken eyes and twig-thin limbs, facing a photographer who could do nothing for them, their fullness \u2014 their love, their humor, their annoyance, their preference \u2014 pared by the lens to reveal what remained, which was hunger.",

      "The five men, all in their 20s, are charged in connection with the the overdose deaths of three 19-year-olds in 2023, including Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez, Akira Stein, daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein, and an unnamed victim, according to a news release from the Drug Enforcement Administration.",
      "The five suspects were identified as Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver and brothers John Nicolas and Roy Nicolas.",
      "They all face charges of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fentanyl, para-fluorofentanyl and alprazolam, resulting in the deaths of De Niro-Rodriguez, Stein and the third victim. If convicted as charged, they face a minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.",
      "Epperson was arrested Tuesday in Troy, New York, the DEA said, while McIver was arrested Tuesday in Houston, Texas. John Nicolas was arrested Saturday in Buffalo, New York, while Roy Nicolas was arrested Saturday in Valley Stream, New York. Barreto surrendered to authorities Wednesday in Manhattan. All five have made their initial court appearances.",
      "De Niro-Rodriguez's mother Drena De Niro previously said he died after being sold pills laced with fentanyl. The medical examiner ruled his death accidental, caused by mix of fentanyl, cocaine and other drugs.",
      "\"Defendants who distributed the drugs, who killed these young 19-year-olds knew that they were deadly,\" Clayton said.",
      "Prosecutors allege the five people arrested used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands of counterfeit prescription opioid pills laced with fentanyl to teens and young adults.",
      "\"Drug trafficking organizations have weaponized social media in a way that allows them to expand their network, make more profits and, unfortunately, get more people addicted to their poison,\" Frank Tarentino, special agent in charge for the DEA's New York Division, said in a news conference Thursday.",
      "One of the victims allegedly warned one of the five suspects arrested that the drugs they had sold her caused her to overdose, and\u00a0 she told him \"just warn customers in batch might be extra strong,\" according to federal court documents. She later died after another overdose, prosecutors said.",
      "The second victim died of an overdose two weeks later, and De Niro-Rodriguez died of an overdose less than a month after that.",
      "De Niro-Rodriguez and his mother appeared in the 2018 movies \"A Star Is Born\" and \"Cabaret Maxime.\" He was also credited with an appearance in 2005's \"The Collection.\"",

      "Leandro De Niro Rodriguez - our Leo - was kind, curious, and full of promise. He was a young man just shy of his 20th birthday, with a bright future ahead of him. We miss him terribly. We know there are thousands of families like ours who understand the nightmare of losing a child or loved one to fentanyl poisoning.",
      "The recent indictments in relation to the wrongful deaths of Victim #1 (whose name has not been made public at this time), Akira Stein, and Leandro De Niro Rodriguez is yet another painful reminder of an epidemic that has risen to plague proportions in the U.S. In 2023, there were 100,000 overdose related deaths. Out of over 2,400 New Yorkers who died of fentanyl-related overdose deaths, approximately 75 of them were teenagers and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24.",

      "The indictment alleges they \"maintained a year-round market for opioids and crack cocaine\" in the park, adding the various defendants have been arrested more than 80 times for drug-related crimes and, when they were released, they returned to the park and kept selling drugs.",
      "\"The defendants are aware that their drugs cause overdoses,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Pictures in the indictment reportedly show the scene after two people fatally overdosed on drugs containing fentanyl, allegedly sold to them from dealers in the Washington Square Park area.",

      "Billie Eilish wants billionaires to donate more.",
      "As the Grammy and Oscar winner accepted the music award at this year's WSJ. Magazine Innovator Awards on Wednesday night, she urged the ultra-wealthy to address more of the world's issues.",
      "\"We're in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country,\" Eilish said to an audience that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. \"I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things, maybe give it to some people that need it.\"",
      "Late-night host Stephen Colbert\u00a0introduced Eilish onstage at New York's Museum of Modern Art by announcing that she would donate $11.5 million of the proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour to causes dedicated to food equity, climate justice and reducing carbon pollution.",
      "In accepting the award, the \"Bad Guy\" singer added a polite but direct call to others in the room, saying a lot of people, especially in the U.S., could use some help right now.",
      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

      "Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" one of the most influential rock songs ever recorded, was released 50 years ago.",
      "It broke records and soared to the top of the British charts. It was No. 1 twice in the U.K. and also made history with the first ever promotional rock video.",
      "But in the U.S., the song took 17 more years and being featured in the movie \"Wayne's World\" to turn into a mega hit. Today, it has almost 3 billion streams on Spotify, which is the most for any 20th century song.",
      "\"It changed the dynamics of music\"",
      "The hit song came to life in the Welsh countryside at Rockfield Studios, which was set up in the 1960s by two farmers and musicians, Charles and Kingsley Ward.",
      "Queen's band members \u2014 Freddie Mercury, John Deacon, Roger Taylor and Brian May \u2014 lived at Rockfield for two weeks in 1975, working on their fourth album, \"A Night at the Opera.\"",
      "\"I don't think anybody realized at the time that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' would end up the iconic record it was,\" said Kingsley Ward, who's now 85 years old.",
      "In the main studio, which is still in use, Queen laid down the song in three sections \u2014 choral, hard rock and opera. The sound was revolutionary, as was the length of the track at almost six minutes.",
      "\"It's probably the greatest record ever made, a rock record, because it changed the dynamics of music, and people now realize they can do anything with music,\" Ward said.",
      "Ward remembers Queen's leader, Mercury, as \"very quiet, unassuming and just a genuinely nice person, wasn't flamboyant at all.\"",
      "He said Mercury kept the band waiting for the song they then knew only as \"Freddy's thing.\"",
      "\"Brian and John were playing frisbee. I remember talking to Brian and saying, 'You've been here a long time, five days, you haven't done much.' And I think Brian said, 'Freddy's in there writing something.'\"",

      "\"Now, the odd thing is, a lot of people ask me, 'did Freddy get the idea of that iconic line, 'any way the wind blows,' looking at the weathercock?' We don't know, because Freddy's not here to tell us, but it's a great story, isn't it?\"",

      "Prince Andrew is being stripped of his titles and must surrender his lease to Royal Lodge, the mansion in Windsor where he lives, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace.",
      "\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor,\" the statement said. \"Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.\"",
      "Andrew had recently said he would stop using his royal titles and honors, including the Duke of York, but Thursday's statement on behalf of King Charles III and Queen Camilla initiated the formal process of revoking all his titles, including prince.",
      "\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement said.",
      "Andrew has come under intense scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and accusations from\u00a0Virginia Giuffre\u00a0that she was trafficked to engage in sex with the prince while she was underage. Andrew has denied the allegations. He reached a\u00a0settlement with Giuffre in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,\" the statement said.",
      "Giuffre's family said Thursday in a statement provided to CBS News' partner network BBC News, \"Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.\"",
      "\"Today, she declares victory. We, her family, along with her survivor sisters, continue Virginia's battle and will not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\" said the statement sent on behalf of her brother, Sky Roberts, and sister-in-law, Amanda.",
      "In a memoir published posthumously, Giuffre detailed her alleged encounters with Andrew.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, [Ghislaine] Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\" (Maxwell was convicted for her role in trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence.)",
      "In 2022, Andrew gave up his military affiliations, royal patronages and official public duties. He also stopped using the title \"His Royal Highness.\"",
      "Andrew had faced heavy criticism from the British public over his living arrangements, with many voicing concern that he continued to live in his mansion on a royal estate despite the accusations leveled against him and his retreat from royal duties.",
      "His 75-year lease for Royal Lodge, signed in 2003, included an up-front payment of around 8 million pounds (around $10.5 million) and an annual rent described as a \"peppercorn,\" meaning an extremely small amount, according to\u00a0BBC News. Part of that payment was for renovations to the property, which at the time was in a state of disrepair, and Buckingham Palace felt that having Andrew pay the cost to upgrade the property was better than using public funds, BBC reported.",
      "The lease had previously been referred to as \"cast iron,\" and Buckingham Palace said it needed to negotiate with Andrew in order to remove him, but did not provide further information about the details of those negotiations.",
      "Buckingham Palace said Andrew will move out of the residence as soon as possible and will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, located about 100 miles north of London.",

      "It's not uncommon for businesses to initiate layoffs following a merger. When Skydance completed its purchase of Paramount, the combined company said it would look for \"opportunities to streamline its business.\" Paramount is also rumored to have interest in buying Warner Bros.

      "Charles Mitchell strode up the steps of 55 Wall Street, determined to project his usual sense of confidence and certitude. It had been a crushing afternoon. As he returned to his office, he knew that the eyes of Wall Street were on him \u2014 everyone from the traders in the street to his own secretary was assessing his gait and searching his face, trying to read meaning into every twitch, every line, every wrinkle.",
      "In his gray three\u2011piece suit, shoulders back, Mitchell kept up his smile as he passed through the glass\u2011domed central hall of his National City Bank. With its eighty\u2011three\u2011foot ceiling and two solid bronze doors protecting a safe weighing some three hundred tons, the bank was the largest in the country.",
      "It was just past 5:30 p.m. on Monday, October 28, 1929. Hours earlier, the stock market had closed with a sharp, dizzying drop of 13 percent after a week of downward convulsions; today was by far the greatest fall. The darkening downtown streets still teemed with anxious brokers in their fedoras and flat caps, messenger boys and switchboard girls, all gossiping and speculating about the collapse. What caused the fall? How much further might it go tomorrow? Would the markets even open?",
      "As Mitchell made his way to his office, the teller windows he passed reflected the weary puffiness under his eyes and his disheveled, graying eyebrows. He collapsed into the chair behind his mahogany desk. The room was furnished with the high formality befitting an eighteenth\u2011century statesman: antique wood chairs, a grandfather clock that stood against the cream\u2011white woodwork flanked by portraits of George Washington orchestrating the newly independent nation with the purpose and resolve that Mitchell sought to emulate in his own life.",
      "The athletic fifty\u2011two\u2011year\u2011old bank chairman \u2014 an unusually optimistic man whom the press called \"Sunshine Charlie\" \u2014 had spent the afternoon in emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, puzzling over how to calm the market. It was a moment for which a self\u2011consciously Great Man like Mitchell should have been utterly prepared. He had the experience, the stature, and the steely nerves necessary to steer Wall Street through these tough times.",
      "Yet he felt exposed, vulnerable.",

      "\"Our portfolio today has been tremendously increased in our holdings of National City Bank stock,\" Baker told him.",
      "Mitchell stared at him, waiting to hear exactly what he meant.",
      "Baker finally blurted out: \"We purchased seventy\u2011odd thousand shares.\"",
      "Mitchell, who could calculate numbers instantly in his head, immediately grasped the nature and scale of the problem. That is unbelievable, he thought. The bank didn't have the cash to pay for so many shares. He was outraged \u2014 and terrified. Everything he had built was suddenly at grave risk of collapse.",
      "Barely a month earlier, Mitchell had been on top of the world. He had finalized an agreement to take over the Corn Exchange Bank, a bold acquisition that would turn National City from the largest bank in the country into the largest in the world, stealing the mantle from London and helping New York finally eclipse its rival city as the world financial center. This was history in the making, an overthrow of the established order, the kind of gambit that made Mitchell a king among men.",
      "But to pull off the deal, Mitchell had made a big \u2014 and risky \u2014 bet on the strength of his own stock. Corn Exchange shareholders could take $360 in cash for each of their shares, or four fifths of a share in National City Bank. On paper, the stock was the better deal: As long as National City stock stayed above $450, four fifths of a share was worth more than $360 in cash. At the time the deal was struck, it was comfortably higher, trading at $496 a share. Mitchell needed it to stay there until the deal could be completed, likely in the next month \u2014 because, in truth, National City didn't have the cash to pay everyone, a crucial detail he kept to himself.",
      "So he quietly instructed his traders to buy the bank's shares whenever the price slipped.",
      "In a relatively stable market, this posed no problem. Big publicly traded companies bought back their own shares all the time. In a rapidly falling market, however, doing so could quickly become like shoveling money into a furnace, which was what had been happening that afternoon. In the chaos of all that selling pressure, National City's bids had been accepted so quickly that they lost track of how many they had amassed. By the time traders got a handle on the situation, National City had committed to buy seventy\u2011one thousand of its own shares, far more than it could afford to hold.",
      "\"With that news,\" he told Baker, \"I could be knocked over with a feather.\"",
      "There were very few good options. To fund their daily operations, big banks like National City had to constantly borrow against their assets. But banking law prevented them from offering their own stock as collateral. Thus, those seventy\u2011one thousand shares \u2014 which cost about $32 million \u2014 were a deadweight that could possibly take down the whole bank.",
      "\"It would be embarrassing for us to attempt to borrow on that stock in other banks,\" Mitchell said, knowing full well that his rivals would seize on any such move as a sign of vulnerability. With the market in free fall, short sellers \u2014 traders who bet that stocks would go down \u2014 were lining up targets, probing for weakness.",
      "The stock market was at the breaking point. Sales volume had overwhelmed the human apparatus of the trading floor to such an extent that, on the previous Thursday, the ticker had fallen four hours behind in reporting stock prices, more than twice the longest previous delay.",
      "What this meant was that the big board of prices that loomed over the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was hopelessly inaccurate. Trading stocks in this environment was like being a gambler at a baseball game in the eighth inning and looking at a scoreboard that hadn't been updated since the third, while everybody around you was shouting conflicting opinions about which team was ahead and by how much. The prices of stocks sold privately \u2014 known as \"off\u2011exchange,\" which was the case with National City shares \u2014 were even further behind because they were tied to the broader market's movements without being fully updated in real time, exacerbating the delay. For Wall Street traders, the only prudent decision was to sell and get the hell out of the market. Which is exactly what they were doing.",
      "Mitchell knew that if he tried to unload even a small fraction of National City's position back into such a weak market, rumors would begin to fly about the bank's solvency, and that could easily turn into a vicious cycle that would be impossible to stop. If prices declined fast enough, it could trigger a much larger crisis: A \"lack of confidence might bring a run,\" Mitchell told Baker, envisioning depositors lining up outside every one of its fifty\u2011eight branches around the country.",
      "A run on the country's largest bank. There was nothing bankers feared more.",

      "Selling for nearly $1,000 a cup, a cafe in Dubai is offering the world's most expensive coffee, brewed from Panamanian beans sold at a premium price.",
      "The wealthy emirate is known for its extravagant ventures, including an enormous mall with an indoor ski area, the world's tallest building and an artificial island dotted with five-star hotels.",
      "\"The wait is finally over,\" Serkan Sagsoz, co-founder of the Julith cafe with the pricey offering,\u00a0said in a Facebook video. \"The world's most celebrated and highest graded coffee of all time has arrived at Julith.\"",
      "Located in an industrial neighborhood that has become a hotspot for coffee lovers, Julith plans to serve \"around 400 cups\" of the precious beverage starting on Saturday, Sagsoz told AFP.",
      "\"We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,\" Sagsoz said.",
      "For a price tag of 3,600 dirhams (around $980), the brew offers an experience of floral and fruity flavors reminiscent of tea.",
      "\"There are white floral notes like jasmine, citrus flavors like orange and bergamot and a hint of apricot and peach,\" said Sagsoz, who previously ran a cafe in his native Turkey.",
      "\"It's like honey, delicate and sweet,\" he said.",
      "Dubai notched a Guinness World Record for the world's most expensive cup of coffee last month, when Roasters offered one for 2,500 dirhams.",
      "The new record staggered some people, though residents also said it was par for the course for the desert city with a luxury lifestyle.",

      "The Julith cafe bought its beans at an auction in Panama after a tough battle that lasted many hours and drew hundreds of bids.",
      "It claimed to have paid the highest price ever for coffee.",
      "Twenty kilograms of the beans went for around 2.2 million dirhams, or $600,000, Julith said in a press release.",
      "Asian buyers, Emirati coffee enthusiasts and coffee bean collectors have since reached out to the cafe in the hopes of securing some of the \"Nido 7 Geisha\" beans, which are grown on a plantation near Panama's Baru volcano.",
      "But the cafe said it does not plan to share its treasure, beyond a small amount reserved for Dubai's ruling family.",
      "Coffee prices surging in U.S.",
      "The pricey cup of coffee is being offered as the cost of roasted coffee has jumped 18.9% in the U.S., according to the most recent Consumer Price Index data for September.",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data\u00a0shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are driving this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, is depressing crop yields, Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023, the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according\u00a0to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, which has led producers there to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/snap-benefits-food-stamps-november-shutdown/",
    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 07:43:48 -0400",
    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mother living in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Saturday isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation\u00a0and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

      "The prolonged U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0is putting millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits, a vital lifeline for low-income households.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, stated in a memo on Sunday that no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1, leaving the program's roughly 42 million beneficiaries uncertain about how they'll pay for groceries next month.",
      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",
      "But social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.",
      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",
      "Other states that have announced actions to help SNAP recipients include\u00a0Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia\u00a0and\u00a0Washington.",
      "Officials in these states are stepping in despite the USDA saying states lack the authority to cover benefits and won't be reimbursed.",
      "\"There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,\" the agency said in its memo.",

    "summary": "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything\" if federal food aid is halted, one single mom said.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.",
      "Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.",
      "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything,\" Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. \"It's very stressful \u2014 what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Head Start Association.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding.",
      "Halting funding for these programs \u2014 which help cover food, education, and energy costs \u2014 could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action.",
      "Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.",
      "\"What we are hearing from parents is desperation \u2014 parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication,\" Arreaza told CBS News. \"This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead.\"",
      "Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The USDA is set to\u00a0halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month. Recipients receive an average of about $187 a month on prepaid cards that can be used to buy food at grocery stores, farmers' markets and other retailers.",
      "A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps.",
      "\"It's going to hurt us really bad,\" said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. \"It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed.\"",
      "Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. \"We're not on it because we want to be \u2014 no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed,\" she said.",
      "WIC",
      "Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown.",
      "Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.",
      "\"None of these programs operate in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP.\"",
      "WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.",
      "WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. \"The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic,\" Machell said.",
      "Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC.",
      "Head Start",
      "About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.",
      "Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.",
      "\"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work,\" Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association,\u00a0told CBS News Boston. \"But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds.\"",
      "Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program,\" Chrudimsky\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota this week.",
      "LIHEAP",
      "Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.",
      "\"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds,\" Wolfe told CBS News.",
      "The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as\u00a0energy prices are skyrocketing, he added.",
      "NEADA projects the\u00a0average cost for people to heat a home this winter\u00a0will rise nearly 8%.",
      "\"It's a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households,\" Wolfe said.",

    "summary": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol doesn't expect AI to replace baristas as the coffee chain focuses on improving the \"human-to-human experience\" for customers.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, inheriting a company facing its first revenue decline in four years amid customer complaints about high prices and long wait times. A year later, the coffee giant has halted the slide but faces fresh pressures, from surging coffee bean costs to store closures.",
      "Coffee prices\u00a0jumped 30% from January through September, squeezing Starbucks' profit margins even as Niccol vowed not to raise menu costs this year. The restaurant chain said last month it would spend $1 billion to close underperforming stores and cut 900 jobs.",
      "As Niccol told CBS News' Jo Ling Kent, the retail chain can't rule out price hikes in 2026 due to rising coffee prices, although he described this step as a \"last resort.\" At the same time, Niccol noted that Starbucks has no plans to introduce a value menu like McDonald's and other fast-food chains appealing to budget-conscious patrons.",
      "\"We have a huge point of difference and that is, I think, that customer connection and the experience you get in our stores,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"I just believe, at the end of the day, the experience sets us apart from everybody else.\"",
      "He added, \"Pricing would be one of those things that we do as a last resort, and we do it very surgically. To say never, you know, I don't think you can do that in this environment.\"",
      "\"Human-to-human\"",
      "Starbucks' reboot involves what the company calls its \"Green Apron service model,\" which aims to hire more baristas, improve customer service and cut down on customer wait times.",
      "\"What we're doing right now is making sure that we're staffed correctly,\" Niccol said. \"The teams are trained correctly for the demand that we know we have in the morning, and we know that we're growing in the afternoon.\"",
      "While other companies are turning to artificial intelligence to replace some workers, Niccol said he doesn't envision AI supplanting baristas. He said the technology could be useful for behind-the-scenes tasks, such as managing the company's supply chain.",
      "\"I don't see [AI] replacing our baristas \u2014 that human-to-human experience is just too important,\" Niccol said. \"And I think it really separates our experience from everybody else.\"",
      "While Starbucks is bolstering its barista ranks, it also faces the threat of strikes from Starbucks Workers United, which represents 9,500 workers in some 550 Starbucks cafes across the country. Overall, the company has roughly 201,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Niccol said he's open to talking with union members, but also described his company's pay and benefits as generous, adding that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Although other companies have noted a pullback from low- or middle-income consumers as inflation continues to tick upwards, Niccols said Starbucks patrons are still opening their wallets.",
      "\"Transactions are up, our sales are up,\" Niccol said. \"What we hear from them is they love the experience and they think it's a great value proposition, so I think they're being much more judicious in where they want to spend their money.\"",
      "He added, \"And I think it's really important that you give them a great experience so that it justifies why they chose to spend money with you.\"",

      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike next week.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500\u00a0workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

      "\"Bitcoin ATMs are a tool that scammers, that criminals, are using to separate people, including D.C. residents, from their hard-earned money,\" Schwalb told CBS News. \"Athena, as a bitcoin operator, knows that its kiosks are being used by this element, and yet [has] failed to put proper anti-fraud prevention systems in place to keep it from happening.\"",
      "He added, \"What makes it worse is they are profiting from this because they're charging very substantial fees.\"",
      "Schwalb in September filed a lawsuit against Athena, alleging that it charges \"undisclosed fees on deposits that it knows are often the result of scams, and for failing to implement adequate anti-fraud measures.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Athena Bitcoin said it \"strongly disagrees with the allegations\" and that it will contest the charges in court.",
      "\"We employ aggressive safety protocols to protect the financial interests of our customers. ...Our kiosks employ multiple safeguards, from prominent warnings and daily transaction limits to five separate verification screens designed to stop coerced transactions,\" the company said.",
      "Reynolds is also suing Athena Bitcoin. Her attorney, Vaught Stewart, accused the company of \"not just allowing the fraud to happen \u2014 they're profiting from it.\"",
      "In Washington, D.C., Athena Bitcoin charged fees of up to 26% per transaction, while 93% of all deposits made through the company's ATMs are linked to scams, Schwalb alleged in his suit.",
      "For her part, Reynolds wants to help others avoid losing their savings. \"Now I'm an advocate for just telling people this is real,\" she said. \"Be aware.\"",
      "Financial scams connected to bitcoin ATMs are on the rise, according to the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "The Better Business Bureau, which ranks crypto-related fraud as one of the most common types of financial scams, notes that fraudsters tend to target the senior population.",

    "story": [
      "Billie Eilish wants billionaires to donate more.",
      "As the Grammy and Oscar winner accepted the music award at this year's WSJ. Magazine Innovator Awards on Wednesday night, she urged the ultra-wealthy to address more of the world's issues.",
      "\"We're in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country,\" Eilish said to an audience that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. \"I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things, maybe give it to some people that need it.\"",
      "Late-night host Stephen Colbert\u00a0introduced Eilish onstage at New York's Museum of Modern Art by announcing that she would donate $11.5 million of the proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour to causes dedicated to food equity, climate justice and reducing carbon pollution.",
      "In accepting the award, the \"Bad Guy\" singer added a polite but direct call to others in the room, saying a lot of people, especially in the U.S., could use some help right now.",
      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-government-shutdown-2025-impact-benefits-checks-services/",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:24:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "Visa predicts Americans will spend an average of $736 on holiday gifts in 2025, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",
      "According to the FDA, there is no known safe level of contact with lead. The agency says that continued exposure to elevated levels of lead for months or longer can lead to a range of adverse health effects, particularly in young children.",
      "\"High levels of exposure to lead in utero, infancy and early childhood can lead to neurological effects such as learning disabilities, behavior difficulties and lowered IQ,\" the FDA states in its most recent alert.",
      "Lead can also cause long-term health problems in adults, according to the World Health Organization, including increased risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and kidney damage.",

      "Some federal workers going unpaid during the U.S. government shutdown are resorting to taking out bank loans to tide them over financially.",
      "A San Antonio, Texas, woman whose husband works for the Department of Defense, told CBS News her family\u00a0is relying on a no-interest loan from the United Services Automobile Association (USAA) to pay the bills while he is furloughed.",
      "The woman, who did not want to be named because of concerns about sharing private financial matters, told CBS News the family took out a $3,200 loan from USAA earlier this month, saying that \"we would have been in trouble\" without the money.",
      "Her predicament highlights the financial challenges many government workers are facing as the stalemate in Congress, now on Day 30, continues. She said that one of her five children, who has special needs, underwent spinal fusion surgery earlier this year. Their health plan covered most, but not all, of the procedure's costs, saddling them with medical bills that are now coming due.",
      "\"Insurance took some time to process it all, and things are starting to come in at a really bad time,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Since the shutdown began on October 1, USAA has issued more than $365 million in special loans to over 119,000 federal employees affected by the government shutdown.",
      "\"These are unique, zero-interest, zero-fee loans built specifically to help people meet their essentials during this crisis,\" USAA certified financial planner JJ Montanaro told CBS News.",
      "USAA members can apply for a no-interest loan equal to one net paycheck, for up to $6,000, and have 90 days to repay the loan from its date of issuance, according to the San Antonio-based lender.

      "The credit union's no-interest loans are issued in the amount of members' regular deposits, also up to $6,000. Once workers receive their paychecks again, the amount of the loan will be deducted as repayment.",
      "During a 2018-2019 government shutdown that lasted a record 35 days, Navy Federal issued a total of $53 million in loans to 32,000 recipients. Anne Repczynski, an assistant vice president at the lender, said member enrollment in the financial assistance program has been \"significantly higher\" during the latest shutdown.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on countries around the world, the third in a trio of rebukes of the president's trade policy this week.",
      "In a 51 to 47 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the resolution. Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, supported the resolution. It was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation, requiring just a simple majority.",
      "The resolution is largely symbolic since it almost certainly won't be taken up by the House, where GOP leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs. Senate Democrats forced a vote on the resolution, which was led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, by bypassing GOP leadership using a provision of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law that the president invoked to impose the tariffs.",
      "In April, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, citing \"structural imbalances in the global trading system.\" The president then announced the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, dubbing it \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Wyden, speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, said the president's \"actions clearly go beyond what the law allows, which is why I'm urging passage of this bill to finally end the president's unlawful tariffs.\"",
      "\"The Senate is not a spectator to the workings of the federal government,\" Wyden said. \"When it comes to international trade, and tariffs in particular, the United States Congress has clear authority.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, spoke out against the resolution, saying \"at this juncture, this resolution is counterproductive to helping American families and businesses of all sizes.\"",
      "\"It's no secret that for decades, countries around the globe have raised tariff and non-tariff barriers against Americans and against American business, and have raised the cost for Americans and American businesses without response from the United States. President Trump is now responding,\" Crapo said. \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit.\"",
      "The vote came after Mr. Trump announced overnight that he would cut tariffs on Beijing after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. China was part of the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and has been embroiled in a months-long trade war with the U.S.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans earlier this week on the issue, defended the tariffs, telling reporters that \"tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first.\"",
      "\"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country,\" the vice president said. \"They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Then, on Wednesday, the Senate approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, with support from four Republicans.",
      "Thursday's vote also marked the second time the chamber has weighed in on the issue, after the Senate voted in April on a resolution to Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.

    "story": [
      "Businesses around the U.S. are desperate for pennies.",
      "President Trump's decision to stop producing the penny earlier this year is leaving some merchants short of the one-cent coin and struggling to give customers exact change. Unable to order fresh supplies of pennies, banks are also rationing them.",
      "Some retailers are pulling out all the stops just to scrounge up some pennies. Pennsylvania-based grocery chain Giant Eagle is holding a one-day event this weekend where customers can exchange their pennies for gift cards worth double the value of the coins, CBS News Pittsburgh reports.",
      "Sheetz, a convenience store chain, is also running a promotion offering a free soda to customers who bring in 100 pennies.",
      "Troy Richards, president and chief operations officer at Louisiana-based Guaranty Bank & Trust Co., said he's had to scramble to have enough pennies on hand for his customers since August.",
      "\"We got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,\" Richards said.",
      "Richards said the $1,800 in pennies the bank had were gone in two weeks. His branches are keeping small amounts of pennies for customers who need to cash checks, but that's it.",
      "The lack of pennies has also become a legal minefield for stores and retailers. In some states and cities, it is illegal to round up a transaction to the nearest nickel or dime because doing so would run afoul of laws that are supposed to place cash customers, as well as debit and credit card customers, on an equal playing field when it comes to item costs.",
      "To avoid lawsuits, retailers are rounding down. While two or three cents may not seem like much, that extra change can add up over tens of thousands of transactions. A spokesman for Kwik Trip, the Midwest convenience store chain, said it has been rounding down every cash transaction to the nearest nickel.",
      "That's expected to cost the company roughly $3 million this year. Some retailers are asking customers to give their change to local or affiliated charities at the cash register, in an effort to avoid pennies as well.",
      "Costs more than they're worth",
      "To be sure, retailers and banks aren't clamoring for pennies to stick around. Pennies, especially in bulk, are heavy and largely used to give customers change.",
      "\"We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "The penny, which dates from the\u00a0early days of the U.S. Mint\u00a0after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. One penny cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "\"Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Feb. 9 post on his Truth Social social media platform.",
      "The Treasury Department said in May that it was placing its last order of copper-zinc planchets \u2014 the blank metal disks that are minted into coins. In June, the last pennies were minted, and by August those pennies were distributed to banks and armored vehicle service companies.",
      "Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Piling up in jars",
      "The U.S. Mint issued 3.2 billion pennies in 2024, the last full year of production, more than double that of the second-most minted coin in the country: the quarter. But the problem with pennies is they are issued, given as change and rarely recirculated back into the economy. Americans store their pennies in jars or use them for decoration. This requires the Mint to produce significant sums of pennies each year.",
      "The government is expected to save $56 million by not minting pennies, according to the Treasury Department. Despite losing money on the penny, the Mint is profitable for the U.S. government through its production of other circulating coins as well as coin proof and commemorative sets that appeal to numismatic collectors.",
      "In 2024, the Mint made $182 million in seigniorage, which is its equivalent of profit.",
      "Besides Americans' penny-hoarding habit, a logistical issue is also preventing pennies from circulating.",
      "The distribution of coins is handled by the Federal Reserve system. Several companies, mostly armored carrier companies, operate coin terminals where banks can withdraw and deposit coins. Roughly a third of these 170 coin terminals are now closed to both penny deposits as well as penny withdrawals.",
      "Bank lobbyists say these terminals being closed to penny deposits is exacerbating the penny shortage, because parts of the country that may have some surplus pennies are unable to get those pennies to parts of country with shortages.",
      "\"As a result of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted\" a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.",
      "The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had any guidance for retailers or banks regarding the penny shortage, or the issues regarding penny circulation.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back\"",
      "The U.S. isn't the first country to transition away from small denomination coins or discontinue out-of-date coins. But in all of these cases, governments wound down the use of their out-of-date coins over a period of, often, years.",
      "For example, Canada announced it would eliminate its one-cent coin in 2012, transitioning away from one-cent cash transactions starting in 2013 and is still redeeming and recycling one-cent coins a decade later. The \"decimalization\" process of converting British coins from farthings and shillings to a 100-pence-to-a-pound system took much of the 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "The U.S. removed the penny from commerce abruptly, without any action by Congress or any regulatory guidance for banks, retailers or states. The retail and banking industries, rarely allies in Washington on policy matters related to point-of-sale, are demanding that Washington issue guidance or pass a law fixing the issues that are arising due to the shortage.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",

Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with their party to vote in favor of the resolution, which required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "For months, trade tensions have flared between the U.S. and Canada. In August, the president raised tariffs on the country to 35%, though a large share of goods remain exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Then, over the weekend, Mr. Trump said he is raising tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%, blasting the U.S.'s northern neighbor over an anti-tariff ad by the government of Ontario that used quotes from former President Ronald Reagan.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more\" to combat \"drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, forced a vote to challenge the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, effectively bypassing Senate leadership. He has argued that the tariffs on one of the nation's top trading partners aren't justified under the emergency.",
      "\"I don't think you can say that fentanyl is not an emergency vis-a-vis Mexico or China, but it is ridiculous to say that fentanyl is an emergency with respect to Canada,\" Kaine said. \"And it's a pretext that's just being used to pour more and more tariffs onto Canada.\"",
      "The vote came after the Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Wednesday's vote also marked the second time lawmakers have weighed in on the Canada tariffs, after the Senate approved a resolution aimed at blocking the levies in April.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:53:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Fed on Wednesday announced its second interest-rate cut of 2025, reducing borrowing costs in a move to spur U.S. hiring.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank might pause before further lowering borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.75% and 4%, down from its prior range of 4% to 4.25%. The Fed reduced rates by the same amount in September, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "In a Wednesday afternoon press conference to discuss the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said another rate cut at its next meeting, set for Dec. 10, \"isn't a foregone conclusion.\" That may disappoint some borrowers and investors, given that the Fed last month had penciled in an additional rate cut for its final meeting of the year.",
      "\"There were strongly differing views on how to proceed in December\" during the central bank's meeting today, Powell said. Those conflicting views mean \"we haven't made a decision about December. I'm saying something in addition here \u2014 that it's not to be seen as a foregone conclusion. In fact, far from it.\"",
      "He added, \"We've cut 50 more basis points in the last two meetings, and there's a sense from some, 'Let's pause here,' and a sense from others, 'Let's go ahead.'\"",
      "Stocks erased modest gains after Powell's comments, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.2% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping 0.4%.",
      "The central bank's move to ease monetary policy is aimed at shoring up economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, spurring consumer spending and investment by businesses. Although the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has delayed release of the Labor Department's September jobs report, other indicators point to a continued slowdown in hiring. The ADP National Employment Report, for instance, showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 last month.",
      "In its policy\u00a0statement on Wednesday, the Fed said \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting last month that risks to the labor market are growing.",
      "While Powell said the Fed is watching layoff announcements from large businesses such as Amazon, he added that the weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating. His comments indicate that another back-to-back rate cut this year isn't a certainty, financial experts said.",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn't a sure thing,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email. Investors \"were negatively surprised that future cuts might be taken off the table.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the panel that sets the Fed's monetary policy, isn't scheduled to meet on interest rates in November.",
      "Data blackout",
      "The near-total blackout on government economic data during the shutdown may complicate the Fed's decision-making, experts said. Typically, Fed officials are able to draw on a host of official reports, ranging from measures of employment growth to inflation markers, as they seek to determine the best path for policy.",
      "\"While today's rate cut and the general direction of future policy remain relatively clear, guidance on the committee's perspective on economic conditions is more necessary than ever,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"A prolonged government shutdown and ongoing tariff negotiations continue to introduce significant uncertainty into the immediate monetary policy outlook.\"",
      "Powell noted that the lack of official economic data may complicate the Fed's December decision, given that the central bank relies on such information to assess the economy.",
      "\"What do you do when you are driving in the fog? You slow down,\" Powell said.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 FOMC members voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, with two members objecting. Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, preferring a 0.50 percentage point cut, as he did at the September meeting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffry Schmid also dissented, saying he preferred no rate change.",
      "Inflation battle",
      "While the Fed is now focused on weakness in the labor market, its battle against inflation isn't over. The Fed cranked rates higher after consumer prices soared during the pandemic, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Because higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, businesses and consumers typically react by paring spending, which dampens demand throughout the economy and cools inflation. Since mid-2022, inflation has receded to an annual rate of 3% as of September, although that remains higher than the Fed's target of a 2% annual pace.",
      "While the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs are starting to trickle through to consumer prices, the impact has been more muted than economists had predicted earlier this year. Some businesses are eating some of the tariff costs, while others stocked up on imports earlier in the year to get ahead of the import duties.",
      "\"Though inflation is still higher than comfortable, the jobs market is holding on to signs of weakness, and their desire to stimulate the economy further is likely to continue outweighing inflation concerns,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at financial services company TruStage.",

      "In widely expected job cuts after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount has begun layoffs set to impact about 2,000 employees.",
      "Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs companywide on Wednesday (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The rest of the cuts are expected to be made at a later date. In all, 2,000 job reductions amount to about 10% of Paramount's total workforce.",
      "\"These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company,\" CEO David Ellison wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees.",
      "The prospect of job cuts has hovered over Paramount employees for some time. Ellison on Wednesday reiterated that the company has been working to restructure since the completion of its merger in August, and noted that workforce cuts are \"part of that process.\"",
      "It's not uncommon for businesses to initiate layoffs following a merger. When Skydance completed its purchase of Paramount, the combined company said it would look for \"opportunities to streamline its business.\" Paramount is also rumored to have interest in buying Warner Bros. Discovery, the home of HBO, CNN and DC Studios, among other brands.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",
      "In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent\u00a0CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as \"bad,\" up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.",
      "\"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious,\" Challenger said.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We go now to the Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, who joins us this morning from Far Hills, New Jersey. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY:\u00a0 Hey, thanks, Margaret, good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So our CBS polling shows that there is real concern among Americans regarding the effect of the shutdown on all transportation. Should Americans also have safety concerns at this point?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I think that's a great question. We work overtime to make sure the system is safe. And we will slow traffic down, you'll see delays, we'll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe. But we have to be honest, when we have controllers, where we have shortages and towers and TRACONs doing two jobs, does it add more risk into the system? Sure, it does. But again, we're always managing that. Again, we don't- we don't want crashes, we want people to go safely, and so we will slow and stop traffic if we don't think we can manage it in a way that keeps people safe as they go from point A to point B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, I did see that the FAA said, up in New York, 80% of air traffic controllers were absent from New York area airports, and that same day, there was a near miss at LaGuardia Airport. One United plane clipped another one. Was that pilot error? Or was that linked to some kind of shortage?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, you mentioned the shortages of air traffic controllers in the New York airspace. We had a couple days ago, three hour delays throughout New York. And again, I haven't got the readout yet on whether that was pilot error. And usually, when these planes are- are traveling very close to each other, it's their job to stay away from one another. That's not controllers, it's usually pilot error. But again, I'll have to look and see what directive was given by the air traffic controllers. But it's normally the pilot's responsibility to stay away from aircraft on the tarmac.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So if this shutdown continues, how- when does it become an emergency in terms of passenger safety and the safety of those who are trying to, for example, get home for Thanksgiving in a few weeks.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No, we will stop traffic. So we're not going to let that happen. I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right? We've seen problems at LA, in Dallas, in DC, Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse. We have controllers who, some of them are new controllers. We have trainee controllers who are very helpful in the tower. They don't make a lot of money, and they're now confronted, they haven't had a paycheck for over a month. They're confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions. I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make. Let's open the government up. Let's pay these people, these young controllers. Margaret, it's really important, I think you've covered this, we don't have the best equipment in our towers and centers for air traffic control. But we have the safest airspace, we have the most efficient airspace because we have the best controllers in the world that work our skies and keep our people safe. They deserve a paycheck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, given that they are so essential, is there any way the administration can find a pot of money like seems to be getting found for others, like the military, to pay controllers so they can show up to work? Why isn't the administration able to do that?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I think that's a great question. So we have done all we can. President Trump has done all he can to minimize the pain of the shutdown on the American people. Again, you remember under Barack Obama's shutdown, he was trying to gate off open air monuments in Washington, DC, and were shutting down parks just walking paths. President Trump has tried to make it less painful on the American people. So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law. And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. That's fine, that's fair. But again, these people should be paid. And to say that it's Donald Trump's fault, to say he has to find money, when Democrats have said there's no money for you because we've shut the government down, I mean, that's a contorted analysis. And Democrats are trying to do that, and I don't think it really works. Give the money and we'll pay the controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I saw reports that air traffic controllers only received partial pay mid-October, and this past week they missed a paycheck altogether. So practically speaking, for those who are in these jobs, would you advise them to pick up part time work elsewhere?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, I'm clearly asking them, come to work. It is your job to come to work, and eventually you will be paid. But as I've traveled around the country and talked to air traffic controllers, they've told me that a lot of them can navigate missing one paycheck. None of them can manage missing two paychecks. And they're like every American family, everyone watching your show today as they think about their own finances, how many paychecks can they miss before it becomes real stress, real strife in their life? And so they're- at the- next week, they're going to get a notice of what their next paycheck is going to be. And if the government doesn't open, the notice will be another big fat zero, and you're going to see more of them probably make the decisions of funding their families, putting food on their table, gas in their cars, versus coming into work. That's not what I want, but I'm a realist as well, Margaret, these are the decisions of life and survival that these controllers have to make. By the way, it's the technicians, also. We have old equipment. We have technicians that work in the towers that keep the equipment operational. They're not getting paid. I have train inspectors who are working to keep our trains running and running safely. They're working without pay. I have pipeline inspectors, same thing. Across the system. We have a number of people who are working without pay. We talk about the air traffic controllers, but I have thousands of employees who are showing up, doing the work and trying to keep this system safe for the American people all the while they don't get paid to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Understood. So you said back on Fox Business on October 9 that \"I can't have people not showing up for work and that they may be let go.\" There's a shortage of 4,000 controllers already. You're not firing people, are you? You can't afford to.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, so when- we're 2-3,000 controllers short, but that's a huge number. And you make an interesting point, because I've tried to surge air traffic controllers into the system through our academy. Margaret, we're up 20% of controllers through the academy this year alone. It takes them about a year to two to get certified in a tower, but this shutdown is impacting my pipeline of controllers. And so as- when everyone forgets about air traffic control and the shutdown, I'm going to deal with the consequences of, again, delivering for the American people and getting more controllers in the towers, not less. And you bring up a good point. We're already stressed in that we don't have enough controllers in our system, and this shutdown, when we have staffing triggers where they're not coming in because they're funding their families and food on their tables, that makes it more difficult because we're already short long. Long term consequences--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not going to fire them?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I don't plan on firing control. No, listen, I have, no, I- again when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers. I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 All right. Secretary Duffy, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:01:08 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump and both parties are drawing negative ratings for their handling of the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it.",
      "There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes, along with that concern about national impact.",
      "Politically, that means no one is \"winning\" overall: Congressional Democrats, Republicans and President Trump are all drawing increasingly negative marks for their handling of it as it has gone on.",
      "Democrats express more concern over the economic impact than Republicans do.",
      "Other governmental functions, including air travel, also draw concern due to the shutdown.",
      "Most disapprove of how all the players involved are handling it, and those views have become a bit more negative over October, the month when the shutdown began.",
      "Looking within the rank-and-file of each party, both congressional Republicans and Democrats draw majority approval from their respective partisans. But the Republican base is even more solidly approving of its delegation than the Democrats are of their own.",
      "Some of that is related to attention: the Democrats who don't approve or are unsure of their party aren't following news of the shutdown as closely. Another may be financial: Rank-and-file Democrats generally express more concern about the shutdown's effects on the economy and on themselves, and the Democrats who do approve are also a little more likely to call their own financial situation good, so they may think of themselves in a better position to weather any impact.",
      "But overall, Congress isn't perceived as even working to end it.",
      "Continued uncertainty in the economy",
      "Americans are especially sensitive because the economy continues to elicit uncertainty.",
      "Ratings of it have been bad for years \u2014 nothing much has changed there \u2014 and expectations for the coming year remain mixed at best. Support for tariffs remains negative as it has been; views of the job market are also negative \u2014 and there's also continuing concern, amid all the recent news about AI investment and the market, that AI will take jobs.",
      "But perhaps most of all, prices are still seen as rising \u2014 a reminder amid a sea of other measures that it is prices, not the rate of change in inflation, that Americans often perceive most immediately.",
      "Few expect prices to come down in the next few months, either.",
      "Those who expect continued higher prices and have a more negative outlook on the economy are particularly concerned about the economic effects of the shutdown.",
      "Politics, parties and the week ahead",
      "One year on from his election victory, most Americans do perceive Mr. Trump as trying to fulfil his campaign promises, even though many say it's a different approach than they expected \u2014 nor do all approve.",
      "And as we're reminded again this week amid more state elections, politics is about choices, not just evaluations.",
      "On the policy front, Mr. Trump and the Republicans' perceived approaches to both economic and immigration policy are today favored over the Democrats' in a straight-up comparison. (A sizable number don't seem to like either, or aren't sure.)",
      "For context, ahead of this week's races and as we head into a midterm election year, there's always the political question of how much of a factor Donald Trump will be in other contests, and whether Democrats also need to move this needle on perceived policy approach to be competitive.",
      "One item drawing attention this week is the New York mayor's race (which most people nationally say they're following, if not very closely.) We asked Democrats nationwide what they thought their party's economic policies should be as it regards socialism and capitalism \u2014 and most Democrats would see their party have a mix of both, but not more of one exclusively.",
      "And another topic in focus this week will be redistricting, where Californians will vote on a redistricting measure, while debates over redrawing lines take place across multiple states.",
      "The American public is not so keen on all that. Most of them think the lines ought to be left alone until 2030, or that more competitive \u2014 not more gerrymandered \u2014 districts ought to be drawn.",
      "Only a quarter of the public (largely, only the strongest partisans) want more districts one party can win.",
      "Specific issues",
      "Meanwhile all of that economic uncertainty \u2014 and mixed approach \u2014 does continue to take its toll on Mr. Trump's ratings on inflation and the economy, specifically. Those, along with the shutdown, continue to weigh on his overall approval, and all have been ticking down over time to their lows for this term. Inflation, in particular, sees him with two-thirds disapproving.",
      "Mr. Trump does get relatively better, if not positive, marks on immigration. That's been the case for a while, in part, because his GOP is so solidly behind him on the matter, including his deportation program, and in part because Americans overall do say border crossings are down under his administration.",
      "The negotiated peace deal between Israel and Hamas has given Mr. Trump a bump in his approval on handling that conflict. He gets relatively higher approval from independents (and Democrats to some extent)\u00a0 on handling the Israel-Hamas conflict than he does overall.",
      "He gets more positive marks on this than he does overall and on the economy, inflation and immigration, more specifically.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump's approval has ticked down just a point from early October, and remains in the low 40s where it has generally been since mid-summer.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,124 U.S. adults interviewed between October 29-31, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "summary": "A majority of Americans think Trump's policies are bringing migrant crossings at U.S-Mexico border down.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's deportation program has divided Americans in recent months, marked by consistently strong backing from Republicans and MAGA Republicans, in particular, and less so among others. Earlier in President Trump's term, it had larger majority approval, but since mid-summer, the program has hovered around more even division. Its approval is a bit higher today than last month.",
      "Part of the rationale for people supporting or opposing it has been their perception of who is being targeted for deportation.",
      "When Americans think criminals are being prioritized, they're far more likely to back the program. That perception, too, is divided.",
      "Specifically, of late, slightly more than half the country feels ICE is being too tough in detaining and stopping people, more so than not tough enough. And a majority feel ICE officers should not be allowed to wear masks while on duty.",
      "There are some \u2014 about a quarter \u2014 who approve of the deportation program and who don't think ICE should be allowed to wear masks.",
      "More broadly, a majority of Americans think Mr. Trump's policies are making migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border go down, and those who do largely approve of the administration's deportation program, perhaps indicating that the two are connected in their minds in gauging the overall approach to immigration.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military has carried out another lethal strike on alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Saturday.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post, said a U.S.-designated terrorist organization allegedly operated the vessel but did not name which group was targeted. He said three people were killed in the strike.",
      "It's at least the 15th such strike carried out by the U.S. military in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific since early September. The U.S. military has now killed at least 64 people in the strikes.",
      "\"This vessel\u2014like EVERY OTHER\u2014was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth said in a post on social media.",
      "Hegseth said no U.S. forces were harmed in the strike.",
      "The news comes after the Pentagon announced on Oct. 24 that it would be sending the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, to the waters off Latin America. This move dramatically increased the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's\u00a0campaign\u00a0to counter narcotics traffickers.",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. He has asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.",
      "The White House has repeatedly rebuffed U.S. lawmakers in their demand that the administration release more information about the legal justification for the strikes, as well as greater details about which cartels have been targeted and the individuals killed.",
      "Hegseth, in his Saturday post announcing the latest strike, said \"narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home\" and the Defense Department \"will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda.\"",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said in an exclusive interview with CBS News on Oct. 24 that some of those killed in the U.S. strikes have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.",
      "Senate Democrats renewed their request for more information about the strikes in a letter on Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Hegseth.",
      "\"We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,\" the senators wrote.",
      "Among those signing the letter were Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Sens. Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.",
      "The letter says that thus far the administration \"has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information\" with some members, \"while excluding others.\"",
      "Earlier Friday, the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee released a pair of letters sent to Hegseth, written in late September and early October, requesting the department's legal rationale for the strikes and the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.",

      "President Trump threatened to stop all aid to Nigeria and has instructed the Pentagon to \"prepare for possible action\" in the West African country, accusing the country's government of allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Mr. Trump accused the Nigerian government for a second-straight day of not doing enough to prevent the killings of Christians. He threatened that the U.S. \"may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"",
      "\"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "In a post to X Saturday night in response to Mr. Trump's statement, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote, \"Yes sir.\"",
      "\"The killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria \u2014 and anywhere \u2014 must end immediately. The Department of War is preparing for action,\" Hegseth wrote. \"Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"",
      "The Department of War is the Trump administration's preferred term for the Defense Department. \"",
      "The Nigerian government has vehemently rejected the claims, and analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said Saturday on social media that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "The warning of possible military action follows an announcement on Friday that he would designate Nigeria \"a country of particular concern\" as it relates to religious freedom, a move that had been pushed by some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "The designation does not necessarily mean that sanctions, which could include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid, will be imposed, but it is one step ahead of that.",
      "\"Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0in a social media post. \"Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a 'COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he would be asking several U.S. lawmakers to look into the matter and report back on what the response to the designation should be.",
      "\"The United States cannot stand by while such atrocities are happening in Nigeria, and numerous other Countries. We stand ready, willing, and able to save our Great Christian population around the World!\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",
      "The State Department usually releases\u00a0its annual\u00a0Report on International Religious Freedom in the spring, but has not yet done so this year. The report may or may not include \"particular concern\" designations, which can be done at any time. And, such designations, which authorize U.S. penalties, do not necessarily impose sanctions.",
      "The State Department's most recent religious freedom reports cover 2023 and were released last year under the Biden administration. These reports, like others on broader human rights and human trafficking, cover the previous calendar year and are often late in being submitted.",
      "The designation comes after Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has been trying to rally fellow evangelical Christians to urge Congress to designate Nigeria as a violator of religious freedom with claims of \"Christian mass murder.\"",
      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians.

      "New York \u2014 With just days to go before polls close in New York City's fractious race for mayor, frontrunner Zohran Mamdani spoke Saturday with former President Barack Obama, even as some major Democrats have taken a cautious political approach when it comes to the democratic socialist.",
      "A source familiar confirmed their call, first reported by the New York Times. In a statement to CBS News, a spokeswoman for Mamdani's campaign said the candidate \"appreciated President Obama's words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city.\"",
      "Mamdani's win in June over former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a crowded mayoral Democratic primary was arguably the most significant progressive primary victory since now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated a Democratic incumbent congressman in 2018. The win by Mamdani upended Democratic party politics in a year where the national party has struggled to repair its brand issues after a disastrous 2024 election cycle.",
      "While Mamdani's success so far has brought the 34-year-old politician praise, it has also led to more focused criticism for his record, or lack thereof.",
      "Even after Mamdani's summer primary win, some national Democrats have either been slow to publicly embrace him, or have avoided doing so altogether.",
      "In Tuesday's general election contest, Mamdani is facing off against Cuomo, now running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries waited until Oct. 24, the eve of early voting, to endorse Mamdani. Meanwhile, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have not endorsed in the race.",
      "At a rally last week with Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mamdani said his opponents, Cuomo and Sliwa, possess \"the playbook of the past.\"",
      "\"New York, our work has only just begun,\" Mamdani said as the rally ended. \"On [Tuesday] November 4th we set ourselves free.\"",
      "And in these final days of the contest, Democrats aren't the only ones making political decisions that don't follow normal party lines.",
      "In an interview earlier this week with CBS News, Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York, a former state GOP chair, said of Cuomo that \"no one was a fiercer critic of his time as governor than I was.\"",
      "\"We fought him tooth and nail every step of the way,\" said Langworthy, who is supporting Cuomo for mayor. \"But he would be a far superior choice for the people of New York than Zohran Mamdani.\"",
      "Langworthy also expressed concern about the implications of a Mamdani victory, saying Mamdani's policies would become \"contagious around the country if he has a platform to talk to vast sums of people.\"",
      "The national impact of the race isn't lost on either major party given what a Mamdani victory could mean for control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms, where Republicans are attempting to defend a narrow majority. Whichever party holds the House will likely play a major role in how Washington functions in the final two years of President Trump's term.",
      "Moderate Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York backed Cuomo late last month, saying in a social media post, \"I'm a Democratic Capitalist, not a Democratic Socialist. I endorse Andrew Cuomo. I can not back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America.\"",
      "As Democrats continue to face questions about how the party can recover and win back voters, Mamdani's run for mayor may provide a telling guide of sorts for the kind of authentic messaging and grassroots campaigning that the left has struggled to cultivate on a national stage outside of Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential runs.",
      "Speaking at the late October Mamdani rally, Sanders said \"a victory here in New York will give hope and inspiration to people throughout our country and throughout the world.\"",
      "\"That is what this election is about. And that is why Donald Trump is paying attention to this election,\" Sanders said.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Nancy Mace allegedly berated and cursed at police officers tasked with escorting her through Charleston International Airport in South Carolina on Thursday, allegedly saying they were \"[expletive] incompetent,\" according to an incident report.",
      "According to a police incident report, officers with the Charleston County Aviation Authority Police Department were assigned to meet the Republican congresswoman at 6:30 a.m. Thursday to escort her from the curb to her flight. The officers were told she would be arriving in a white BMW at the ticketing curb area.",
      "At around 6:35 a.m., they were told she was running late and they kept waiting. According to the report, the officers never saw the car arrive.",
      "Surveillance video from the airport obtained by CBS News via the Freedom of Information Act shows Mace arrive at a sidewalk entrance in a dark-colored sedan around 6:50 a.m. No one else was visible in the vehicle.",
      "Around 7 a.m., the officers were informed that Mace, 47, was at the entrance for the Known Crewmember program \u2013 a trusted access lane overseen by the Transportation Security Administration and intended for flight crew members. The report said the officers made their way over \"in less than a minute.\"",
      "A separate surveillance video from the airport appeared to show Mace at the TSA security checkpoint speaking with airport officials. \u00a0It took about seven minutes from the time Mace first appeared at the TSA entrance to when the escorting officers arrived, according to the video.",
      "When the officers met Mace to escort her, they said she \"began loudly cursing and making derogatory comments to us and about the department. She repeatedly stated we were '(expletive) incompetent\"' and 'this is no way to treat a (expletive) US Representative',\" the report states.",
      "\"She also said we would never treat (U.S. Sen.) Tim Scott like this,\" the officer tasked with escorting Mace says in the report.",
      "Police said Mace allegedly cursed and complained at the officers and into her phone during the entire walk to her gate. After she boarded her flight, an airline employee and several other TSA agents said they were shocked and upset by her behavior at the security checkpoint and gate, the officer says in the report.",
      "\"Any other person in the airport acting and talking the way she did, our department would have been dispatched, and we would have addressed the behavior,\" the officer said in the report.",
      "On X, Mace appeared to respond to part of the story, sharing the surveillance video showing her arrival at the airport, followed by her standing in the TSA screening area \"with no security.\"",
      "\"And for the FAKE NEWS: This is the entrance ALL Members of Congress use at the airport,\" she wrote. \"Are you going to write that Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott use the same entrance or no?\"",
      "The congresswoman's director of operations, Cameron Morabito, told CBS News in a short statement on Saturday that \"apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes for a worthy headline.\"",
      "\"We are forced to take the Congresswoman's safety extremely seriously. After the world watched\u00a0Charlie Kirk's\u00a0assassination, the threats against her have only intensified,\" the statement said. \"Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.\"",
      "Morabito's statement did not address the alleged comments made by Mace to the police escort officers.",
      "An aide with Mace's office told CBS News that these travel and security arrangements are routine and that the situation has been \"blown out of proportion.\" A phone text exchange viewed by CBS News showed the coordination messages between Mace's staff and airport security officials, which said that she would be arriving curbside in a silver BMW at 6:30 a.m. It also showed the exchange when Mace was delayed.",
      "When asked about Mace's alleged comments to the police officers, the aide referred CBS News to remarks the congresswoman gave to the New York Times.",
      "In that interview, Mace said she has been on high alert since Kirk's assassination and said she \"100% yes\" complained at the airport. She told the newspaper it was partly because the death threats she has received in recent weeks have intensified.",
      "\"We all get frustrated when it's not taken seriously,\" she told the Times.",
      "Mace said some of the recent threats had rattled her.",
      "\"One guy had a bunch of electronics in his car,\" she told the newspaper. \"Someone followed me home. We're dealing with all of these things on a daily basis.\"",
      "Mace first came to Congress in 2021 and has gained recognition as a GOP firebrand in recent months after shifting positions in recent years. She launched her campaign for governor of South Carolina in August.",

    "summary": "Two federal judges on Friday said the Trump administration must tap into contingency funds to make SNAP payments during the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Two federal judges on Friday said the Trump administration must tap into contingency funds to make payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown, ruling against the government in a pair of suits over the imminent benefits lapse. Roughly 42 million Americans\u00a0rely on SNAP\u00a0to help buy food.",
      "In a case brought by a coalition of states in federal court in Massachusetts, Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the government is required by law to tap into the emergency money to make at least partial payments, and gave the administration until Monday to tell the court whether it planned to do so.",
      "In Rhode Island, Judge John J. McConnell, Jr.   granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of municipalities and nonprofits that sued to block the imminent funding freeze, according to attorneys for Democracy Forward, the group leading the suit. The ruling was made from the bench. An entry on the case docket said the court \"orders the USDA to distribute contingency funds\" and report back to the court by noon on Monday.",
      "McConnell on Saturday ordered the Trump administration to pay SNAP benefits in full by Monday and to report to the court by noon regarding the status of the distribution. In the order, the judge said that if the government chooses to use its discretion and decides not to use other funds to make a full payment, then it must make a partial payment using the total amount of the contingency funds. The order said the contingency funds must be used to make a partial payment by Wednesday.",
      "In her ruling, Talwani stopped short of ordering the administration to send SNAP payments on Saturday, but she rejected the government's argument that the $5 billion contingency fund cannot be used to fund benefits during the lapse in appropriations.",
      "\"At core, Defendants' conclusion that USDA is statutorily prohibited from funding SNAP because Congress has not enacted new appropriations for the current fiscal year is erroneous,\" Talwani wrote. \"To the contrary, Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds.\"",
      "Talwani wrote that \"the court will allow Defendants to consider whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and report back to the court no later than\" Monday.",
      "SNAP benefits provide eligible families with an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card for food purchases. Many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. The Trump administration said money for the program was due to expire on Saturday because of the ongoing government shutdown, now on its 31st day.",
      "In a post Friday night on Truth Social, President Trump\u00a0wrote that he has \"instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\" The president blamed Democrats for causing any delay to the funding and added, \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.\"",
      "The suit in Massachusetts was brought by two dozen states and the District of Columbia earlier this week. They asked the court to require the administration to tap into the emergency funds to keep SNAP money flowing to states, which administer food stamp programs. The states argued that the administration's decision to cut off payments was unlawful and threatened to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, said in a memo last week that \"the well has run dry\" and that November benefits would not be paid without an end to the shutdown. Administration officials and Republicans in Congress have said that the roughly $5 billion in the contingency fund could not legally be used to cover the shortfall.",
      "\"By law, the contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said at the Capitol on Friday.",
      "Talwani, the judge in Massachusetts, rejected that argument in her ruling: \"[U]nder Defendants' statutory construction, the use of the separately appropriated contingent reserve to fund SNAP benefits is somehow predicated on Congress's annual appropriation of funds to the SNAP program. Congress placed no such restrictions in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act.\"",
      "She wrote that the suspension of SNAP payments to the states was \"based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments.\"",
      "\"This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program,\" the judge wrote. \"And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds ... to avoid any reductions.\"",

      "The Trump administration on Thursday announced it would set the lowest refugee admissions cap in U.S. history, allocating just 7,500 spots for this fiscal year, mostly for Afrikaners who it has claimed are facing racial discrimination in South Africa for being White.",
      "The previous lowest refugee ceiling was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.",
      "The announcement Thursday is the latest effort by Mr. Trump and his top aides to dramatically scale back the decades-old U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, a humanitarian policy for vulnerable people fleeing war and violence across the world that once enjoyed robust bipartisan support.",
      "Mr. Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program hours after taking office for a second time earlier this year, citing strains on American communities receiving the refugees and concerns about the vetting process. Weeks later, his administration made an exemption for Afrikaners, calling them victims of racial oppression.",
      "In an order posted on the federal government's journal of regulations, Mr. Trump said the 7,500 refugee spots for fiscal year 2026 would \"primarily be allocated among Afrikaners\" and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" Fiscal year 2026 started on Oct. 1 and culminates at the end of September 2026.",
      "The South African government has vehemently denied Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted. Before the 1990s, White South Africans enforced a brutal system of apartheid over the country's Black majority.",

      "The prioritization of Afrikaners \u2014 while refugees from places like Afghanistan, Myanmar and Sudan plagued by ethnic violence and armed conflict are being blocked from entering the U.S. \u2014 has led to accusations of preferential treatment among refugee advocates.",
      "Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, one of several national groups that traditionally have worked with the U.S. government to resettle refugees, said Mr. Trump's decision \"lowers our moral standing.\"",
      "\"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added.",
      "Officially created in 1980, the U.S. refugee program was designed to offer a safe harbor to people abroad fleeing persecution because of their race, religion, political views or membership in a social group.",
      "Before the second Trump administration took office, refugees were typically referred to the U.S. by United Nations officials and spent months or years in third-party countries undergoing interviews, as well as security and medical checks, before being granted entry into the U.S. The process is distinct from the asylum system, which can be accessed by foreigners already on American soil, including those who enter the U.S. illegally.",

      "The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running.

      "New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli may have a chance in the race against Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill to win back the governor's office from Democrats after a surprisingly close election four years ago.",
      "But a national political environment that may serve as a referendum on Republican President Trump's first year in office could close that window for the GOP.",
      "Mr. Trump has supported Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, and backed him as he faced a competitive primary, even going as far as to hold a telephone rally for him recently. Ciattarelli is running for governor for a third time, after falling short in a surprisingly close race against Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021.",
      "Sherrill says Ciattarelli has shown \"zero signs of standing up\" to Trump",
      "On the Democratic side, Sherrill, who represents New Jersey's 11th District in Congress, has a favorable national political environment, but is contending with potential political fatigue within the state about her party's back-to-back terms controlling the governor's office. Sherrill has been adamant about tying Ciattarelli to President Trump and focusing her campaign on affordability.",
      "\"He's shown zero signs of standing up to this president. In fact, the president himself called Jack 100% MAGA,\" Sherrill said during a debate.",
      "Ciattarelli faults Democrats for being \"out of touch and ruining our state\"",
      "Ciattarelli has faulted Sherrill for relying on generalities and platitudes while also centering his argument for change on New Jersey Democrats' lengthy tenure in control of state government.",
      "\"Trenton Democrats: out of touch and ruining our state. They push offshore wind while our electric bills skyrocket. They raise tolls and fees but haven't fixed our roads and they care more about pronouns than property taxes,\" Ciattarelli said in one campaign advertisement. \"Had enough? Me too.\"",
      "Sherrill was not the most progressive candidate in this year's New Jersey primary race, and she may also have to contend with the Democratic brand issues that have haunted national Democrats in the wake of 2024, due to her career in Congress.",
      "Democrats' winning streak in the state could also give Republicans an anti-incumbency argument, and it wasn't long ago that a Republican led the state. From the 1970s onwards, neither party has been able to win the New Jersey governor's race three straight times.",
      "The final stretch",
      "Sherrill is getting campaign support before Election Day from former President Barack Obama, in another signal of the importance the contest has for a party still facing a vacuum of leadership at the national level. And Mr. Trump held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli before Election Day, as Republicans look to return a GOP candidate to the governor's office for the first time since Chris Christie led the state.",
      "Back in 2021, Ciattarelli narrowly lost the New Jersey governor's race to incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. The race, occurring early in Democratic President Joe Biden's tenure, was far closer than was expected, given the state's more reliable Democratic lean, with Murphy winning out over Ciattarelli by around three points.",
      "In a close race, New Jersey's Latino voters may also play an influential role for either candidate. Democrats have a voter registration advantage over Republicans in the state, although their numbers have dipped as of late. Statistics show that since the start of the year the number of registered Democrats in New Jersey has fallen by more than 12,000 but remains above 2.5 million in the state. Republican voter registration has grown by close to 29,000 but still trails Democrats by more than 855,000, with around 1.67 million registered to the GOP. Unaffiliated voters still make up a larger share of the state's voters than the GOP and only narrowly trail the Democratic party's numbers.",

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",

    "story": [
      "With the Senate out of town, the government shutdown is almost certain to extend through at least Monday, as millions of Americans begin to feel its effects. Among them are those who rely on Head Start, a free early childhood development program for low-income families.",
      "The Southwestern Wisconsin Community Action Program is shuttering nine Head Start centers in early November because of the shutdown. A program in Richland Center, Wisconsin, is closing its doors Friday. Stephanie Wallace, who has taught at the center for 13 years and has now been temporarily laid off, said goodbye to her students this week.",
      "\"Some of the kids already knew,\" she said. \"We told them, you know, we're not going to see you for a little bit.\"",
      "According to the National Head Start Association, approximately 140 Head Start programs nationwide, serving roughly 65,000 children, will stop receiving federal funding beginning Nov. 1. In addition to educational support, Head Start also provides screenings, health and dental care and nutrition for children from low-income families.",
      "Tawny Hardyman, the director of Southwest CAP Head Start, told CBS News, \"I think families are going to feel like the rug is being yanked out from underneath them.\"",
      "Jennie Mauer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, ran through the broader implications of the government funding pause.",
      "\"In Wisconsin, we know that the majority of our Head Start Families are working in our communities, and when parents don't have safe child care, they struggle to get to work,\" Mauer said, adding, \"These Head Start programs are cornerstones of their local communities \u2014 helping folks get to work, employing people and spending money with local trades.\"",
      "Roughly 75% of the families at the Richland Center facility also rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. Community organizers say losing child care and food assistance at the same time could compound the challenges faced by low-income families during the government shutdown. SNAP benefits are set to expire Saturday, although half the states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration this week to stop its\u00a0suspension.",
      "\"Hunger in our community will go up 100%,\" said Chris Frakes, the senior director of the Southwest Wisconsin Community Action Program. \"So, we're doing what we can to make sure that we don't have kids who aren't eating for days on end.\"",
      "Senators have taken over a dozen failed votes on funding the government, but left Washington, D.C., for the weekend. This essentially guarantees the 2025 shutdown will last at least 34 days, tying the record for the longest shutdown ever. Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for the impasse.",
      "Asked by CBS News whether the Senate should be leaving town now, with SNAP benefits expiring, GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa replied, \"Well, we would love the Democrats to open the government.\"",
      "President Trump has an idea for ending the standoff, telling Senate Republicans in a social media post Thursday to \"play their TRUMP CARD\" and go \"nuclear\" \u2014 that is, to \"get rid of the Filibuster.\"",
      "The Senate requires only a simple majority to pass most legislation, but its filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if 60 senators vote to end debate.",
      "Eliminating the filibuster rule would only require a simple majority, and it would enable Republicans to approve the House-passed continuing resolution without Democrats and reopen the government. But most GOP senators have long been opposed to doing away with the 60-vote threshold, arguing that it encourages bipartisan compromise.",
      "Democrats have their eyes on yet another key deadline this weekend: Open enrollment begins for the Affordable Care Act, and it could show soaring health insurance premiums for the 24 million Americans who buy their health insurance through the program. Democrats are betting that sticker shock will bring Republicans back to negotiations to extend expiring tax credits that offset the insurance costs.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:01:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A coalition of officials from half of the states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over the suspension of food stamp benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown, as millions of Americans brace for a disruption in federal food aid in the coming days.",
      "The states, which include California, New York and Pennsylvania, are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Department of Agriculture to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u00a0for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",
      "They argue that the administration's decision to cut off food stamp payments, which are provided to roughly 42 million people nationwide, is unlawful and threatens to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The states involved in the suit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\u202fRhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.",
      "As the government shutdown continues to drag on, the Trump administration announced last week that federal food aid would not go out on Nov. 1 after the Department of Agriculture declined to tap into roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the food stamp program flowing.",
      "The agency blamed Democrats for failing to back a House-passed stopgap bill to fund the government, writing on its website that \"the well has run dry.\"",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" a spokesperson for the USDA said in response to the lawsuit. \"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"",
      "The agency's plan for a lapse in funding, issued Sept. 30, said that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits in the event\" of a funding lapse.",
      "But a memo from the USDA issued last week said \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits\" and are instead meant for things like assisting people in disaster areas. The document cited Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded.",
      "Still, state officials argued in their lawsuit that the USDA's claim that the contingency funds can't be used to fund food benefits during a lapse in federal funding violates the text of congressional appropriations law and is a \"dramatic change\" in its own policy.",
      "They noted that during the last shutdown, USDA said in guidance in January 2019 that said that \"limited funding is available from the contingency that can be used to provide benefits for February.\"",
      "\"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running. There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"",
      "The Trump administration has attempted to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to reopen the government, announcing cancellations of federal funding for programs in blue states and issuing layoff-notices to thousands of federal workers.",
      "The ongoing shutdown, which is in its 28th day, is now the second-longest on record.",
      "Ahead of the approaching halt to food stamp payments, some states have said they will work to keep the assistance going to beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps, and recipients receive, on average, a payment of $187 on prepaid cards that can be used to buy groceries.",
      "The impending lapse in food stamps has raised concerns among Republicans and Democrats. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced legislation last week that aims to ensure continued funding for the food assistance program during the shutdown. The plan has garnered support from 10 other Republican senators and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont.",

    "summary": "The United Nations human rights chief says the Trump administration \"must halt\" strikes on alleged drug boats to prevent \"extrajudicial killing.\"",
    "story": [
      "Geneva \u2014\u00a0The United Nations human rights chief said Friday that U.S. military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are \"unacceptable\" and must stop.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a U.N. organization.",
      "Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for T\u00fcrk's office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular U.N. briefing: \"These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.\"",
      "She said T\u00fcrk believed \"airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.\"",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks on what his administration calls \"narco-trafficking vessels\" as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S., but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. military strike in the campaign on Wednesday. He said it targeted a boat carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Four people on board the vessel were killed. It was the 14th strike and the 15th boat destroyed since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.",
      "In some but not all of the strikes, U.S. officials have said\u00a0the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "The administration announced just weeks ago that it had determined the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, including Tren de Aargua.",
      "The administration announced that determination in a notification to Congress in September, after the first couple strikes on alleged drug boats in the Mediterranean. That notice referred to three individuals killed in a Sept. 15 strike as \"unlawful combatants,\" which is the same term former President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks.",
      "After Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress authorized the use of military force against the terrorist organizations responsible for the terrorist attacks carried out that day. Congress has not yet authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels, and many details of the operations remain unclear, including which U.S. forces are carrying out the strikes, based on what specific intelligence, and with what weapons.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has been among the most vocal critics of the strikes, questioning their legality under international law, and their efficacy in combating the gangs that traffic narcotics during an interview with CBS News. The Trump administration sanctioned Petro last week, saying he had allowed \"drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Shamdasani noted the U.S. explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by \"careful limits\" placed on the use of lethal force.",
      "Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing \"an imminent threat to life,\" she said. \"Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.\"",
      "The strikes are taking place \"outside the context\" of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.",

      "The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc., which is a separate entity from the Black Lives Matter protest movement, has long been accused by right-wing critics of not being transparent enough with how it spends its donations. Part of that criticism came when the group used more than $6 million to buy a house in Los Angeles.",
      "The group defended the purchase in a 2022 post on its website, writing that the house \"serves as a space for Black folks to share their gifts with the world and hone their craft as they see fit, under the conditions that work best for them and in a safe space free from systems of oppression that exist in various creative industries.\"",
      "The national Black Lives Matter foundation raised more than $90 million in 2020, the organization disclosed in a 2020 report. The group had over $28 million in assets as of June 2024, according to recent financial disclosures.",
      "It is unclear specifically when the investigation into Black Lives Matter was launched, but it is being run out of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, which handles cases in or near Los Angeles, the source said.",
      "The Associated Press was first to report the existence of an investigation into the nonprofit foundation.",
      "In a statement, Black Lives Matter said that it \"is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.\"",
      "\"We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,\" the group continued.",

      "But China has rapidly expanded its nuclear arsenal in recent years, a trend that the Pentagon expects to continue for the rest of the decade.",

      "The U.S. military is discussing a missile launch this week in a \"show of force\" against recent Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, CBS News reported earlier Wednesday.

    "story": [
      "A former high-ranking homeland security official in the first Trump administration is launching a new online hub Wednesday to facilitate protests and other resistance efforts against President Trump and his policies.",
      "Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, is leading a group of dozens of former national security officials, whistleblowers and a bipartisan group of former elected officials to create a website called defiance.org.",
      "In its mission statement, the bipartisan group says the tool is \"designed to help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News, \"There are many organizations and a million efforts, but there has not been a clearinghouse for people who regularly seek ways to engage. This is a 'Google' for defiance, where people can go to see their options to push back lawfully, peacefully and defiantly.\"",
      "In September 2018, Taylor wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times that said there was a \"quiet resistance\" to President Trump within his own administration, made up of people \"working diligently\" to block what he called the president's \"worst inclinations.\" He disclosed two years later that he had written the op-ed.",
      "The announcement of the new site is intended to capitalize on momentum from the October \"No Kings\" rallies earlier this month, which attracted participants across the country.",
      "The site launched Wednesday with a video of actor Robert DeNiro, a staunch Trump critic, urging protesters and critics to join forces.",
      "\"You can't just sit on your ass and wait for the insanity and cruelty to pass. No,\" DeNiro says in the video. \"You gotta stand up and fight.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, \"Further proof that Miles Taylor's entire identity is being a TDS clown. If he actually cared about workers being paid and families receiving benefits, he would urge Democrats to reopen the government \u2013 just like the President has been doing. Democrats could end the shutdown today but Myles (sic) is too blinded by his TDS rage to accept the truth.\" (\"TDS\" is often used by Mr. Trump and his supporters as an initialism for \"Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" a phrase describing some of his critics)",
      "In April, Mr. Trump signed an executive memo targeting Taylor, accusing him of manufacturing stories to sell a book, and ordered DHS, the Justice Department and other government agencies to investigate him and revoke his security clearances, as well as for those who worked closely with him. Mr. Trump also ordered an investigation into the alleged dissemination of classified documents while Taylor worked for the government. Taylor denies he leaked any such material.",
      "Defiance.org is described in its mission statement as a \"nationwide 'mutual aid' pact to defend those under attack.\" It aims to support nonprofit partners, and says it will join \"peaceful protests and legal defense efforts.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News supporters of the effort include Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary from the first Trump administration, and former aide Olivia Troye, both of whom have become vocal critics of the president.",
      "Dozens of former elected leaders and Trump critics, including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman and Joe Walsh, are also supporting the new portal.",
      "Taylor said the mutual aid feature of the portal is intended to help those targeted by the administration. He said a future effort could include rallying legal, political and community leaders to support Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is under investigation by the Justice Department, if he is charged. Taylor said the Defiance.org hub would be used to galvanize and organize legal help, courthouse supporters and public statements in support of Schiff or against the Trump administration.",
      "Riggleman told CBS News the group would seek to \"protect Americans against political overreach and targeted retaliation.\"",
      "The White House has harshly criticized Taylor in the past, including in this statement in April.",
      "\"While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the federal government that 'vowed' to undermine and render effective (sic) a sitting President,\" the White House said.",

    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied ancestor of the T. rex that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",

      "With limited insurance coverage, the Florida couple started researching what's known as \"fertility tourism,\" where patients travel abroad for more affordable fertility care.",
      "Ricardo, who is originally from Colombia, found a clinic in the country's capital of Bogota offering a dramatic price difference\u2014a package of four IVF rounds in Colombia for $11,000 compared to around $60,000 for four rounds in the U.S. Medication costs were also less than half of those in the U.S.",
      "\"It's a no-brainer, especially because I'm from there,\" Escobar said. \"We found that the clinic had an excellent rating and really good results.\"",
      "At the clinic, called Inser, the couple met with Dr. Juan Luis Giraldo, who treats patients from around the world. He said nearly half of his clients come from outside Colombia, and about 15% are from the United States.",
      "\"From the U.S., they mainly come for two things,\" Giraldo said. \"The first is cost, and the second is personalized treatment. It's really common that patients there feel they don't have a close relationship with their doctor.\"",
      "The couple made several trips to Colombia, where their first IVF round produced four viable embryos. After multiple embryo transfers, Quinn became pregnant and gave birth to their son, Lorenzo, in 2023. They returned the following year for another round and are now expecting again.",
      "Quinn estimates they saved between $15,000 and $20,000 per round. Her flexible work schedule made the travel possible, and some bloodwork and ultrasounds were completed in Florida.",
      "Dr. Sangita Jindal, with the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, advises Americans pursuing fertility treatment abroad to carefully review local laws.",
      "\"I would want to know that there is a flexible legal framework that would allow me to bring my embryos back to the U.S. for transfer to my uterus,\" Jindal said. \"Some countries may have prohibitive laws around that.\"",
      "The global fertility-tourism market has grown by more than $50 million in the past year and is projected to reach $800 million by 2030.",
      "For Quinn and Escobar, who became pregnant again after two rounds of IVF, the journey has been more emotional.",
      "\"It's a blessing, really,\" Escobar said. \"Being able to have the first one, and then being able to give our first boy a brother is, is just a blessing.\"",

    "story": [
      "An Australian freshwater Murray cod has surprised scientists by swimming a marathon 530 miles along a major river system, believed to be a record for the species.",
      "The fish, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin.",
      "Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months.",
      "The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through.",
      "\"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin.",
      "Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream toward home.",
      "Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish's travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago.",
      "\"We've been working on these species for decades ... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",
      "The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.",
      "According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes.",
      "Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species' populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing.",
      "\"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\"",

      "The Shenzhou-21 and its crew blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China atop a Long March-2F rocket just before midnight on Friday, or about 11 a.m. Eastern.",
      "The taikonauts on board \u2014 Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang \u2014 will rotate in so the trio currently on board the Chinese space station from the Shenzhou-20 mission, which launched on April 24, can come back home after their six-months in space. The exact date of their return has yet to be announced.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew are scheduled to conduct a total of 27 scientific and applied research projects during their mission, focusing on multiple fields including space life sciences, biotechnology, space medicine, space materials science, microgravity fluid physics and combustion and new space technologies, according to information provided by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).",
      "Along with the taikonauts, Shenzhou-21 is carrying four mice \u2014 two females and two males \u2014 the first live mammals ever carried by China into space. Two previous missions to the Tiangong station carried live fish.",

      "Crowds gathered around the Jiuquan launch site on Friday ahead of the countdown, and a man who identified himself to CBS News only as Mr. Zhao said he was \"very excited\" to be there with his 7-year-old son, \"hoping to plant the seed of a space dream into his heart.\"",
      "China's growing \"space dream\"",
      "China has ramped up its space program unilaterally since being excluded from the International Space Station project \u2014   largely over the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese military's full control over its program \u2014   to achieve its \"space dream\" under President Xi Jinping.",
      "It has manned the Tiangong station since 2021, and there are now plans to bring the first non-Chinese crewmember aboard the facility.",
      "China will arrange for one Pakistani national to undertake a short-term space mission in the future, the CMSA has said, following the signing of a cooperation agreement between the two countries in February.",
      "The process to select a Pakistani national for training has already begun, along with planning for training programs and to prepare logistical support for Pakistanis under consideration.",
      "Following the selection process, two Pakistani nationals will travel to China to train alongside Chinese taikonauts for future missions, the CMSA said.",
      "CMSA spokesperson Zhang Jingbo said during a news conference this week ahead of the Shenzhou-21 launch that China would welcome international partners to participate in missions aboard its space station.",
      "The work done on China's space station coincides with and often compliments the nation's efforts to be the first nation to land a person on the moon's surface in more than 40 years. Chinese officials have made it a public goal to land taikonauts on the moon's surface by 2030, and eventually to build a lunar base.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:05:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 10:26:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Universities have found themselves under pressure from President Trump \u2013 from blocked funds for research, to attacks on their admission policies and diversity programs. Princeton's president says, \"The stakes are really high.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It's a hard time to be a university president,\" said Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber. \"But even in the best of times, you're dealing with such a wide set of constituencies, right? Trustees, alumni, students \u2026 sometimes the president of the United States.\"",
      "Eisgruber found his university under pressure from President Trump this past spring. Along with other schools, Princeton's federal support was frozen \u2013 more than $200 million in grants. \"These were grants in fields like quantum science or artificial intelligence that are high on our list of priorities, and that are also high on the list of priorities for the Trump administration,\" he said. \"So, we were surprised to see those grants suspended.\"",
      "But for many in Mr. Trump's circle, it was anything but a surprise. It was the latest chapter in the president's shakeup of higher education.",
      "Although Mr. Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, the Ivy League has been one of his biggest targets. In the wake of campus protests, the Trump administration has put an emphasis on addressing charges of antisemitism. In recent weeks the administration has ramped up its efforts, offering universities a so-called \"compact\" in exchange for preferential treatment on funding. Universities would have to align with the White House's priorities, from how it defines gender to protecting conservative speech.",
      "On Oct. 20, May Mailman, who has been a key player inside the Trump White House, told the Fox Business channel, \"The federal government has to make difficult decisions, and universities should only get funding if there's going to be a benefit for Americans on the other side of it.\"",
      "So far, only one university (New College of Florida) has agreed to sign the compact. Many have rejected it (including the University of Pennsylvania, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Southern California), and others are reviewing the terms. Princeton is not signing the compact, and Eisgruber, an expert on constitutional law, calls the proposal \"dangerous.\"",
      "In his new book, \"Terms of Respect: How Colleges Get Free Speech Right,\" Eisgruber defends higher education on free speech, and gives universities a road map on how to navigate free speech issues they encounter.",
      "When asked about his book's conclusion that there is a civic crisis  in the United States, Eisgruber said universities often reflect what is  happening in the culture. \"It's on campuses because it's in society,\" Eisgruber replied. \"So, we've got an American crisis in the United States, where we are having trouble talking to one another across political differences. Campuses are part of that society, and they're a place where civil discussions and discussions across difference are especially important.\"",
      "Free speech and political violence",
      "Princeton has had its own stand-offs over speech. In 2015, students held a sit-in in Eisgruber's office, calling for the renaming of the university's School of International Relations, citing racist comments by former President Woodrow Wilson; and personnel disputes have led to sharp criticism from some conservatives.",
      "Eisgruber acknowledges there is work to be done, but says universities need to be careful about moving too close to any particular viewpoint in some debates. \"We shouldn't make the mistake of thinking that what we're doing is looking to mirror political views on a college campus,\" he said. \"It's not our job to just be making the same arguments that are being made out in society. So, there might be a lot of division about, say, vaccines within our society, and a scholarly consensus that is inconsistent with those divisions that says vaccines have been safe and vaccines have been effective. There's not some obligation on the part of universities to reflect the political argument.\"",
      "Making things even more complicated is the specter of political violence. When conservative activist Charlie Kirk was gunned down on a college campus in Utah, Eisgruber said, \"I was so deeply saddened. First of all, I was saddened for Charlie Kirk's family. I was saddened for our country and our Constitution, because whatever else is true and whatever political views one may have, we have got to be a country where people can have discussions without the threat of assassination and political violence. So, I worried. I worried about our future because as these events occur, I fear they deepen our crisis  \"",
      "Asked about the reaction by students to such violence, Eisgruber said, \"First of all, I think college campuses are great places to have conversations and great places to be and, in general, safe places to be, right? We've seen a lot of political violence in our country, you know, at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers, at the Israeli embassy in Washington, at the home of the Pennsylvania governor, at our nation's Capitol. So, I think college campuses in general have done a pretty good job of allowing controversial speech.\"",
      "Universities are not the only institutions in American life dealing with the White House: law firms, arts organizations, even late-night hosts have found themselves the targets of criticism from this administration. But longtime leaders in higher ed are keeping close watch on how universities are responding.",
      "Lawrence Summers, the former president of Harvard, said, \"They're facing tougher problems than any university president has faced since the Vietnam War period 50 years ago.\"",
      "Lee Bollinger, who was president of both Columbia and the University of Michigan, said, \"This is a broad-based attack on norms and values that are really fundamental to the United States as we have known it.\"",
      "Back at Princeton, the school is engaging with the Trump administration to protect its research, and it has been able to get roughly half of the suspended grants restored, after underscoring how those efforts \u2013 in science, energy, and other fields \u2013 matter for the country. But Eisgruber and other university leaders know the storm in higher educations is far from over.",
      "\"The stakes are really high,\" he said. \"There are a number of things \u2013 our Constitution, our commitment to freedom, our commitment to the individual \u2013 that have made a difference to America and have strengthened the world. But our investment, our smart investment by the federal government in research universities and education has been critical to the leadership that we have developed in the world, and it is critical to America's future.\"",

    "story": [
      "Daylight saving time has come to an end for 2025. Early Sunday morning, the clocks fell back and we gained an hour. Here's what to know about the seasonal time change.",
      "When did the time change for the end of daylight saving 2025?",
      "Daylight saving time came to an end on Sunday, Nov. 2, at 2 a.m., when the time went back to 1 a.m.",
      "Daylight saving time\u00a0began last spring\u00a0on March 9. Clocks will \"spring forward\" next year on March 8, 2026, when daylight saving time returns.",
      "Did we lose or gain an hour when daylight saving time ended?",
      "People gained an hour as clocks fell back on Sunday. For most Americans, that means an extra hour of sleep.",
      "Many digital clocks will automatically reset overnight, but remember to change any watches or clocks that need to be manually adjusted.",
      "Darkness will arrive earlier in the evening, and sunrise in the morning will also come earlier.",
      "Why was daylight saving time created in the first place?",
      "Annual clock changes have been around for decades, but the origins of the practice remain something of a mystery. People have pointed toward farmers wanting more daylight or cited various proponents of getting up earlier in the day, but some of those theories are disputed.",
      "Germany began observing daylight saving time in 1916 during World War I, with the thought that it would save energy. Other European countries and the U.S. followed suit in the next few years.",
      "There was some debate around the practice in the decades that followed, but eventually, daylight saving time was enacted in the U.S. as a legal requirement by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.",
      "Which states don't do daylight saving time?",
      "While clocks changed for most of the U.S., there are two states and several territories that do not observe daylight saving time. Clocks will not change in Hawaii or Arizona (except for in the Navajo Nation), American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to the Department of Transportation, which oversees the nation's time zones",
      "States can opt out of observing daylight saving time, but they cannot choose to permanently be on daylight saving time.",
      "Most countries around the world do not observe daylight saving, with the U.S. and most of Europe being the exception rather than the rule, according to the\u00a0Pew Research Center. Parts of Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean also observe daylight saving time.",
      "Among countries that do change their clocks, most of them rolled back an hour in October, according to timeanddate.com.",
      "The debate over daylight saving time today",
      "A 2022 CBS News/YouGov poll found that nearly 80% of Americans supported changing the current system, with more Americans preferring daylight saving time to standard time.",
      "That same year, the Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act that would have made daylight saving time permanent, but it never advanced in the House of Representatives.",
      "President Trump, before his return to office for his second term, said he'd push to eliminate the time change.",
      "\"The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't! Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation,\" he wrote on Truth Social in December of last year.",
      "While his December comment called for the elimination of daylight saving time, Mr. Trump has, in the past, called for permanent daylight saving \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead.",
      "There have been a number of studies finding that changing clocks twice a year can be disruptive for people's health. In addition to impacting mood and mental health,\u00a0researchers at Stanford Medicine this year said that falling back and springing forward may lead to an increase in heart attacks, obesity and strokes.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dealing-with-the-crushing-costs-of-childcare/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:46:36 -0500",
    "summary": "For some, the high cost of child care in the U.S. is a higher expense than rents and mortgages, or even in-state college tuition, and has pushed tens of thousands of women out of the workforce this year alone.",
    "story": [
      "As parents to a one- and three-year-olds, Dr. Yeni Abraham and husband Dele could use a good night's sleep. But one thing in particular keeps them up at night: The cost of child care. According to Yeni, it costs them $100 more than their mortgage. \"It's just insane,\" she said.",
      "The couple lives in Texas. She's a physical therapist, he's an IT engineer. They say the cost of child care is crushing. But that's not the only problem: their friends were signing up for daycare as soon as they found out they were pregnant. \"The demand is there,\" Yeni said. \"And it just never occurred to me that the supply would be so low.\"",
      "Yeni would sometimes have to bring her baby to work with her. \"I'm taking my son to the clinic. He was on my hip while I was treating my patient. Real life, true story,\" she said.",
      "In the United States, child care for two kids costs on average more than rents and mortgages, and even in-state college tuition. It's pushed parents into debt, and pulled thousands of women out of the workforce this year alone.",
      "Reshma Sujani, CEO and founder of the group Moms First, said that of the choices some families are being forced to make, \"none of them are good. And because two-thirds of the caregiving work is often done by women, it's moms who are having to make this choice. So, they're downshifting their jobs. They're dropping out of the workforce entirely.",
      "\"We have lots of conversations about the cost of housing, about the cost of gas, about the cost of eggs,\" Sujani said. \"But when you look at a family's budget and you say, 'What is the most expensive line item?' the answer is child care.\"",
      "And it's not just families who are struggling: \"Part of the reason why we have a shortage is because we don't have enough child care workers,\" said Sujani. \"And we don't have enough child care workers because we've never paid them adequately.\"",
      "Dozens of countries consistently outrank the United States when it comes to child care, most offering free or highly-subsidized programs \u2013 ideas that aren't as foreign to America as you might think. Back in the 1940s, child care was paid for by Uncle Sam. \"We knew the men were going off to war and somebody needed to work,\" said Sujani. \"This was funded by the federal government during World War II. But when the men came back, they dismantled it. And ever since then, we've done really nothing to really fix it or solve it.\"",
      "\"This is how you strengthen your community\"",
      "Fast forward to 2025. While millions of families continue to struggle, calls for solutions have intensified. A growing number of red and blue states are making changes. But none has gone as far as New Mexico. Starting this month, New Mexico becomes the first state to offer free child care to all residents, paid for largely with tax money from the oil and gas industry.",
      "Since 2022, Kari Ellis and her wife, Amanda Cordova, have participated in an early phase of New Mexico's child care reform. They choose the provider; the state foots the bill.",
      "\"If you want people to work, this is how you do it,\" said Ellis. \"You give them the tools and the resources. This is how you strengthen your community.\"",
      "Asked if she could you imagine life if she still had to pay for child care, Ellis replied, \"We wouldn't be in this house right now. She probably wouldn't have her own business. This opened up doors that I don't know would have been possible before. We were able to find a quality place where they are getting the education and support that they need while we're trying to raise good humans.\"",
      "The program has its critics, including those who say child care is the responsibility of the family, not the government.",
      "To the suggestion that previous generations had figured out child care, Ellis said, \"I think that a lot of grandparents probably are still working themselves, and are not even in a position to be able to watch their grandchildren.\"",
      "Cordova said, \"People used to be able to afford a house, and their full family on one income, right? Like, mom could stay home, or whoever could stay home. But we can't do that anymore.\"",
      "An economic issue",
      "It's a message that's made its way to Washington, D.C., and across party lines. Republican Senator Katie Britt of Alabama and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia disagree on plenty, but not this.",
      "\"Our economy loses $122 billion a year because of affordability or accessibility of child care,\" said Britt.",
      "I asked, \"So, this isn't just a social issue, it's an economic issue?\"",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Britt replied. \"Studies show that 59% of stay-at-home and/or part-time working parents say that they want to reenter the workforce, but this reliability, affordability, accessibility issue is keeping them out of it.\"",
      "This year, as part of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" Britt and Kaine updated child care tax credits for the first time in a quarter-century. They also increased tax benefits for businesses providing child care assistance, and larger contributions to dependents care flexible spending accounts.",
      "Kaine said, \"Let's spread the word, because again, getting this done in the statute is one thing. But making sure people know to take advantage of it [is another].\"",
      "Critics argue the larger bill cuts other key social programs and will ultimately hurt families. [In fact, Kaine himself did not vote for the bill.] But both senators say the child care provisions are a win.",
      "I asked, \"So if today, child care is the number one expense that families are facing, when do you think that's gonna change?\"",
      "\"This is a classic thing where there's no one, you know, part of government that's got the whole answer to this,\" said Kaine. \"You do see states doing some cool things. And that's to be encouraged. I have a feeling this work will always be before us. But we've taken a really good step together on this.\"",
      "\"So, what would you say to the parent who's watching now, sitting at their kitchen table, trying to figure out how to pay these bills?\"",
      "Britt said, \"We're fighting for you. And so, we're gonna keep working and keep making sure that we deliver solutions.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:15:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The documentary filmmaker, long a chronicler of the American experience, talks about his latest film for PBS, \"The American Revolution,\" and why the end of the Revolutionary War did not mean the end of our nation's revolution.",
    "story": [
      "To dispel the idea that the American Revolution refers only to a war, we're going to start our look at Ken Burns' latest epic, \"The American Revolution,\" at the end, after the war is won.",
      "In a 1787 address, founding father Benjamin Rush said, \"The American war is over: but this is far from being the case with the American Revolution. On the contrary, nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed. It remains yet to establish and perfect our new forms of government.\"",
      "\"It's all up to us to take whatever has been done and try to make what we can of it,\" said Burns. \"I mean, let's just back up. This is, I think, the most important event since the birth of Christ, the creation of the United States of America, with all of the violence, with all of the sturm and the drang of it, all of the extraordinary people, not just the familiar bold-face names, but the bottom-up people who did the fighting and dying.",
      "\"It's kind of a sun, you know, it has a kind of energy to it,\" he said. \"And that's why I get so animated about the revolution, because you just realize, that was it, the kind of moment of creation.\"",
      "If the 72-year-old Burns sometimes gets a little animated himself, it's because he's devoted his career to animating \u2013 breathing life into our shared past, in such documentaries as \"The Civil War,\" \"Baseball,\" and \"Jazz.\" By now, the cinematic trappings of a Burns film are familiar. But within even the most well-worn story, he always uncovers the unexpected. In his editing room, there is a sign reminding us: \"It's complicated.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is that why history is important to study? It's not to learn happy stories about the past, but to sit with complexity?\"",
      "\"That's the whole story,\" Burns replied. \"Harry Truman said, 'The only thing that's really new is the history you don't know,' which, I just love it. David McCullough told that to me, and I just think it's really important. And he also said that doing good history means that you think that it might not turn out the way you know it did.\"",
      "Consider the film's portrayal of George Washington. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed, who has written of the founders and their flaws and failings, says of Washington that we would not have had a country without him.",
      "\"He's a slave owner in a country that is now proclaiming universal rights and liberties,\" said Burns. \"And he recognizes that in order for this to be a successful venture, people in Georgia and people in Massachusetts are going to have to go, 'Yes, we share some things in common,' which they had never shared before. They were foreign countries. [Washington] seemed to be able to articulate, not just in words, but I would say in deeds and manner and atmosphere, how we were going to coalesce.\"",
      "Holding our past up to the unforgiving light of the present takes years, and an army of filmmakers, based largely in bucolic Walpole, New Hampshire.",
      "Sarah Botstein has worked with Burns for almost 30 years. She, along with David Schmidt and Burns, co-directed \"The American Revolution.\" \"We decided to make it in 2015, so it's almost a decade since we decided to do it,\" she said. \"And for the better part of five or six years, this is really all I thought about.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it like to carry the revolution in your head for that long?\"",
      "\"It's an enormous responsibility, and an enormous privilege,\" Botstein said.",
      "Although the aesthetics of the film are thoroughly 18th century, the concerns of the 21st are never far from mind. The political and cultural tumult of the decade during which the film was made provide the context in which we, the viewers, will watch.",
      "I asked Burns, \"Is America in crisis?\"",
      "\"Oh, I think it's almost perpetuating crisis,\" he replied. \"We've been always disagreeing, and our revolution is the thing. I mean, this is the Civil War. In our film, not intentionally, but once we finish you go, 'Oh, wow, there's this admonition: don't fall out, keep the union together.' Maybe that has some inspirational possibilities in our own difficult times.\"",
      "As with all of Burns' films, we desperately want to know: Can the stories of our past guide us through a future that has rarely felt so uncertain to so many?",
      "Burns said, \"The second sentence of the Declaration is the most important sentence, second most important sentence in the English language after 'I love you.' I mean, there's nothing better than that sentence, and it says: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident.' There is nothing self-evident about these truths! They've never been introduced in this way, quite this way before, that all men are created equal.",
      "\"And so, think about where we are right now and all the divisions that we have, how incredibly helpful coming back to this origin story could be.",
      "\"I mean, this is the kind of stuff that we look for, and that by finding our original narrative, reclaiming our original narrative, you have a chance to begin to heal those things, or at least remind people, 'Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be listening to what the other person said. The other person who disagrees with me is not the enemy.'\"",

    "summary": "A majority of Americans think Trump's policies are bringing migrant crossings at U.S-Mexico border down.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's deportation program has divided Americans in recent months, marked by consistently strong backing from Republicans and MAGA Republicans, in particular, and less so among others. Earlier in President Trump's term, it had larger majority approval, but since mid-summer, the program has hovered around more even division. Its approval is a bit higher today than last month.",
      "Part of the rationale for people supporting or opposing it has been their perception of who is being targeted for deportation.",

      "The game was expectantly tense, with both benches and bullpens clearing after Dodgers left-hander Justin Wrobleski hit Blue Jays shortstop Andr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez on the right hand with a pitch in the fourth inning.",
      "After the players returned to their benches and bullpens, the umpires huddled briefly before crew chief Mark Wegner issued a warning to both dugouts.",
      "Ohtani started the game, but was pulled off the mound after allowing Bo Bichette's three-run homer in the third inning. Pitching on three days of rest, Ohtani was up to 100.9 mph with his fastball but appeared to run out of steam in the third.",

    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani is viewed as the leading candidate to become the next mayor of New York City, even as the contest has divided the normal partisan lines between Republicans and Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 With just days to go before polls close in New York City's fractious race for mayor, frontrunner Zohran Mamdani spoke Saturday with former President Barack Obama, even as some major Democrats have taken a cautious political approach when it comes to the democratic socialist.",
      "A source familiar confirmed their call, first reported by the New York Times. In a statement to CBS News, a spokeswoman for Mamdani's campaign said the candidate \"appreciated President Obama's words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city.\"",
      "Mamdani's win in June over former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a crowded mayoral Democratic primary was arguably the most significant progressive primary victory since now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated a Democratic incumbent congressman in 2018. The win by Mamdani upended Democratic party politics in a year where the national party has struggled to repair its brand issues after a disastrous 2024 election cycle.",
      "While Mamdani's success so far has brought the 34-year-old politician praise, it has also led to more focused criticism for his record, or lack thereof.",
      "Even after Mamdani's summer primary win, some national Democrats have either been slow to publicly embrace him, or have avoided doing so altogether.",
      "In Tuesday's general election contest, Mamdani is facing off against Cuomo, now running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries waited until Oct. 24, the eve of early voting, to endorse Mamdani. Meanwhile, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have not endorsed in the race.",
      "At a rally last week with Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mamdani said his opponents, Cuomo and Sliwa, possess \"the playbook of the past.\"",
      "\"New York, our work has only just begun,\" Mamdani said as the rally ended. \"On [Tuesday] November 4th we set ourselves free.\"",
      "And in these final days of the contest, Democrats aren't the only ones making political decisions that don't follow normal party lines.",
      "In an interview earlier this week with CBS News, Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York, a former state GOP chair, said of Cuomo that \"no one was a fiercer critic of his time as governor than I was.\"",
      "\"We fought him tooth and nail every step of the way,\" said Langworthy, who is supporting Cuomo for mayor. \"But he would be a far superior choice for the people of New York than Zohran Mamdani.\"",
      "Langworthy also expressed concern about the implications of a Mamdani victory, saying Mamdani's policies would become \"contagious around the country if he has a platform to talk to vast sums of people.\"",
      "The national impact of the race isn't lost on either major party given what a Mamdani victory could mean for control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms, where Republicans are attempting to defend a narrow majority. Whichever party holds the House will likely play a major role in how Washington functions in the final two years of President Trump's term.",
      "Moderate Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York backed Cuomo late last month, saying in a social media post, \"I'm a Democratic Capitalist, not a Democratic Socialist. I endorse Andrew Cuomo. I can not back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America.\"",
      "As Democrats continue to face questions about how the party can recover and win back voters, Mamdani's run for mayor may provide a telling guide of sorts for the kind of authentic messaging and grassroots campaigning that the left has struggled to cultivate on a national stage outside of Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential runs.",
      "Speaking at the late October Mamdani rally, Sanders said \"a victory here in New York will give hope and inspiration to people throughout our country and throughout the world.\"",
      "\"That is what this election is about. And that is why Donald Trump is paying attention to this election,\" Sanders said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Two federal judges on Friday said the Trump administration must tap into contingency funds to make payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown, ruling against the government in a pair of suits over the imminent benefits lapse. Roughly 42 million Americans\u00a0rely on SNAP\u00a0to help buy food.",
      "In a case brought by a coalition of states in federal court in Massachusetts, Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the government is required by law to tap into the emergency money to make at least partial payments, and gave the administration until Monday to tell the court whether it planned to do so.",
      "In Rhode Island, Judge John J. McConnell, Jr.   granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of municipalities and nonprofits that sued to block the imminent funding freeze, according to attorneys for Democracy Forward, the group leading the suit. The ruling was made from the bench. An entry on the case docket said the court \"orders the USDA to distribute contingency funds\" and report back to the court by noon on Monday.",
      "McConnell on Saturday ordered the Trump administration to pay SNAP benefits in full by Monday and to report to the court by noon regarding the status of the distribution. In the order, the judge said that if the government chooses to use its discretion and decides not to use other funds to make a full payment, then it must make a partial payment using the total amount of the contingency funds. The order said the contingency funds must be used to make a partial payment by Wednesday.",
      "In her ruling, Talwani stopped short of ordering the administration to send SNAP payments on Saturday, but she rejected the government's argument that the $5 billion contingency fund cannot be used to fund benefits during the lapse in appropriations.",
      "\"At core, Defendants' conclusion that USDA is statutorily prohibited from funding SNAP because Congress has not enacted new appropriations for the current fiscal year is erroneous,\" Talwani wrote. \"To the contrary, Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds.\"",
      "Talwani wrote that \"the court will allow Defendants to consider whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and report back to the court no later than\" Monday.",
      "SNAP benefits provide eligible families with an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card for food purchases. Many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. The Trump administration said money for the program was due to expire on Saturday because of the ongoing government shutdown, now on its 31st day.",
      "In a post Friday night on Truth Social, President Trump\u00a0wrote that he has \"instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\" The president blamed Democrats for causing any delay to the funding and added, \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.\"",
      "The suit in Massachusetts was brought by two dozen states and the District of Columbia earlier this week. They asked the court to require the administration to tap into the emergency funds to keep SNAP money flowing to states, which administer food stamp programs. The states argued that the administration's decision to cut off payments was unlawful and threatened to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, said in a memo last week that \"the well has run dry\" and that November benefits would not be paid without an end to the shutdown. Administration officials and Republicans in Congress have said that the roughly $5 billion in the contingency fund could not legally be used to cover the shortfall.",
      "\"By law, the contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said at the Capitol on Friday.",
      "Talwani, the judge in Massachusetts, rejected that argument in her ruling: \"[U]nder Defendants' statutory construction, the use of the separately appropriated contingent reserve to fund SNAP benefits is somehow predicated on Congress's annual appropriation of funds to the SNAP program. Congress placed no such restrictions in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act.\"",
      "She wrote that the suspension of SNAP payments to the states was \"based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments.\"",
      "\"This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program,\" the judge wrote. \"And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds ... to avoid any reductions.\"",

      "A federal judge in Tampa has ordered the arrest of a former Green Beret accused of plotting to invade Venezuela in 2020 after he failed to show up to court for a hearing on whether he should be taken back into custody for violating the conditions of his pre-trial release.",
      "Jordan Goudreau, 49, was arrested last year on weapons smuggling charges tied to the failed coup attempt undertaken during the first Trump administration.",
      "He was released after a few weeks in jail when filmmaker Jen Gatien pledged her $2 million Manhattan apartment where the combat veteran was living as collateral for a bond. In testimony this week, Gatien detailed how the three-time Bronze Star recipient turned abusive, alleging he threatened to harm her and others and sent text messages saying he wouldn't go back to jail.",
      "\"I believe he intends one day to leave this country,\" Gatien said, noting that Goudreau previously lived on a sailboat in Mexico.",
      "Judge Christopher Tuite issued an arrest warrant Friday after waiting 30 minutes for Goudreau to show up for the third day of the bond hearing. A probation officer said the ankle monitor Goudreau was supposed to wear was still located in the Tampa area, where Goudreau was living while undergoing equine-assisted therapy supervised by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.",
      "\"I'm at a loss,\" Goudreau's attorney Marissel Descalzo told the judge. \"I have not spoken to him as to why he's not here.\"",

      "Gatien's new documentary, \"Men of War,\" is a largely sympathetic look at Goudreau's slapdash plan to train a mercenary force of Venezuelan army deserters in neighboring Colombia to carry out a cross-border raid that aimed to spark a popular rebellion and remove President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "The plot, exposed by The Associated Press two days before the incursion, never stood a chance against Maduro's far superior security forces and ended with several would-be freedom fighters killed and two of Goudreau's U.S. Special Forces buddies locked away in a Venezuelan prison.",
      "Since the movie's release last month, the relationship between the two has soured and in the weeks leading up to the bond hearing the filmmaker in court filings accused Goudreau of deceit, financial coercion and threatening conduct.",
      "Specifically, Gatien accused Goudreau of reneging on a promise - described by prosecutors as an \"undisclosed side agreement\" - to pledge his sizable reserves of cash, gold coins and cryptocurrency to mitigate the filmmaker's financial risk as his sole bond guarantor.",
      "She also shared with the court screenshots of angry text messages, sometimes incoherent and full of profanity, in which he claims \"I'm not going back to prison\" - a statement prosecutors say indicates his intention to flee.",

      "Among those scheduled to testify at the hearing for the government was an Oklahoma couple which was storing some of Goudreau's belongings, including two assault rifles an associate recently tried to retrieve in possible violation of a court order against possessing firearms while on bond.",
      "In a sworn affidavit, Brande and Jason Woolems explained that Goudreau had called them last month pressuring them to make false accusations against Gatien to block her from backing out of the bond.",
      "The couple said in their sworn statement that Goudreau asked them to sign statements that accused Gatien of misconduct.",
      "\"When we declined, he called us 'Judas' and accused us of betrayal, yelling repeatedly in anger,\" they said in the statement.",
      "Bay of Piglets",
      "The 2020 invasion, which came to be known as the Bay of Piglets, stands as a cautionary tale of the often amateurish way the Trump administration has pursued regime change in Venezuela.",
      "Those criticisms have grown stronger in recent weeks as a naval flotilla deployed by Trump has carried out multiple deadly strikes on suspected drug smuggling boats departing Venezuela and the president authorized the CIA to carry out covert actions inside the South American country.",
      "The United Nations human rights chief said Friday that U.S. must stop its military strikes against boats in the region \u00a0to prevent \"extrajudicial killing.\"",
      "Amid growing concern about a potential U.S. invasion, Goudreau has reemerged as a media pundit popular with Trump supporters and \"radical leftist\" critics alike.",
      "In recent interviews, Goudreau has at times lashed out at an array of purported deep-state actors - the CIA and State Department among them - that he blames for \"sabotaging\" his clandestine mission, which he insists was blessed with a wink from the first Trump administration.",
      "Many of those same actors are once again trying to derail Trump's foreign policy agenda, he said. Meanwhile, he called Trump's allegations that Maduro is the leader of the so-called Suns Cartel of drug-running military officials a \"fabrication of the CIA.\"",
      "\"If we do invade Venezuela what's next?\" he recently told Russian state-owned RT. \"The truth of the matter is the Venezuelan opposition is as ruthless and tyrannical as the Venezuelan regime under Nicolas Maduro.\"",
      "Days after Goudreau's failed raid, Venezuela's government detained two other Americans on suspicion of plotting to topple Maduro's government.",
      "Plot aimed to oust president",
      "Goudreau, who was born in Canada, said he became a believer in the cause of Venezuelan democracy after working security at a benefit concert held in Colombia to deliver humanitarian aid across the border.",
      "Despite a lack of Spanish, he drew close to several exiled allies of opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who the U.S. then recognized as Venezuela's legitimate leader. Over several months, a plan was hatched to invade Venezuela with the goal of sparking a popular rebellion. As part of that effort, Goudreau signed a contract with the Guaid\u00f3 team, although the two sides split months before the raid was carried out under new leadership possibly infiltrated by Maduro's intelligence services.",
      "Goudreau was scheduled to go on trial in February on charges of failing to obtain an export license to ship roughly 60 AR-15 rifles to clandestine camps where would-be freedom fighters were being trained.",
      "According to U.S. officials, Goudreau and others \"conspired to export AR-type firearms, night vision devices, laser sights and other equipment from the United States to Colombia without obtaining the required export licenses. These unlicensed exports were undertaken to carry out activities in Venezuela.\"",
      "Two of the rifles seized in Colombia contain traces of Goudreau's DNA, while suppressors, night-vision goggles and other equipment had serial numbers matching those purchased by Goudreau and his Melbourne, Florida-based security firm Silvercorp, according to prosecutors.",
      "Gatien registered a Florida production company with Goudreau in 2021 and was described in court records as his girlfriend. In testimony Gatien denied being anything more than good friends with Goudreau, who lived with her for two years while attending the New York Film Academy.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 20:09:49 -0400",
    "summary": "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything\" if federal food aid is halted, one single mom said.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.",
      "Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.",
      "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything,\" Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. \"It's very stressful \u2014 what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Head Start Association.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding.",
      "Halting funding for these programs \u2014 which help cover food, education, and energy costs \u2014 could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action.",
      "Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.",
      "\"What we are hearing from parents is desperation \u2014 parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication,\" Arreaza told CBS News. \"This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead.\"",
      "Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The USDA is set to\u00a0halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month. Recipients receive an average of about $187 a month on prepaid cards that can be used to buy food at grocery stores, farmers' markets and other retailers.",
      "A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps.",
      "\"It's going to hurt us really bad,\" said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. \"It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed.\"",
      "Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. \"We're not on it because we want to be \u2014 no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed,\" she said.",
      "WIC",
      "Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown.",
      "Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.",
      "\"None of these programs operate in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP.\"",
      "WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.",
      "WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. \"The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic,\" Machell said.",
      "Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC.",
      "Head Start",
      "About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.",
      "Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.",
      "\"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work,\" Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association,\u00a0told CBS News Boston. \"But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds.\"",
      "Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program,\" Chrudimsky\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota this week.",
      "LIHEAP",
      "Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.",
      "\"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds,\" Wolfe told CBS News.",
      "The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as\u00a0energy prices are skyrocketing, he added.",
      "NEADA projects the\u00a0average cost for people to heat a home this winter\u00a0will rise nearly 8%.",
      "\"It's a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households,\" Wolfe said.",

    "summary": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol doesn't expect AI to replace baristas as the coffee chain focuses on improving the \"human-to-human experience\" for customers.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, inheriting a company facing its first revenue decline in four years amid customer complaints about high prices and long wait times. A year later, the coffee giant has halted the slide but faces fresh pressures, from surging coffee bean costs to store closures.",
      "Coffee prices\u00a0jumped 30% from January through September, squeezing Starbucks' profit margins even as Niccol vowed not to raise menu costs this year. The restaurant chain said last month it would spend $1 billion to close underperforming stores and cut 900 jobs.",
      "As Niccol told CBS News' Jo Ling Kent, the retail chain can't rule out price hikes in 2026 due to rising coffee prices, although he described this step as a \"last resort.\" At the same time, Niccol noted that Starbucks has no plans to introduce a value menu like McDonald's and other fast-food chains appealing to budget-conscious patrons.",
      "\"We have a huge point of difference and that is, I think, that customer connection and the experience you get in our stores,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"I just believe, at the end of the day, the experience sets us apart from everybody else.\"",
      "He added, \"Pricing would be one of those things that we do as a last resort, and we do it very surgically. To say never, you know, I don't think you can do that in this environment.\"",
      "\"Human-to-human\"",
      "Starbucks' reboot involves what the company calls its \"Green Apron service model,\" which aims to hire more baristas, improve customer service and cut down on customer wait times.",
      "\"What we're doing right now is making sure that we're staffed correctly,\" Niccol said. \"The teams are trained correctly for the demand that we know we have in the morning, and we know that we're growing in the afternoon.\"",
      "While other companies are turning to artificial intelligence to replace some workers, Niccol said he doesn't envision AI supplanting baristas. He said the technology could be useful for behind-the-scenes tasks, such as managing the company's supply chain.",
      "\"I don't see [AI] replacing our baristas \u2014 that human-to-human experience is just too important,\" Niccol said. \"And I think it really separates our experience from everybody else.\"",
      "While Starbucks is bolstering its barista ranks, it also faces the threat of strikes from Starbucks Workers United, which represents 9,500 workers in some 550 Starbucks cafes across the country. Overall, the company has roughly 201,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Niccol said he's open to talking with union members, but also described his company's pay and benefits as generous, adding that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Although other companies have noted a pullback from low- or middle-income consumers as inflation continues to tick upwards, Niccols said Starbucks patrons are still opening their wallets.",
      "\"Transactions are up, our sales are up,\" Niccol said. \"What we hear from them is they love the experience and they think it's a great value proposition, so I think they're being much more judicious in where they want to spend their money.\"",
      "He added, \"And I think it's really important that you give them a great experience so that it justifies why they chose to spend money with you.\"",

      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration.

    "summary": "Jeffrey Epstein's schedule, flight logs and personal calendars detail his connections with high-profile people including Woody Allen and leaders in finance and public affairs.",
    "story": [
      "Many of the famous and powerful people who have long sought to publicly downplay their connections to Jeffrey Epstein in fact had more involved relationships than they've acknowledged, according to documents recently made public by Congress.",
      "Detailed calendars, daily schedules and flight manifests were among more than 8,000 pages of documents reviewed by CBS News, providing a glimpse into Epstein's habits and relationships.",
      "Some of those relationships spanned years and involved dozens of meetings, events, meals and travel, and now records of those interactions are spilling out into public view. Several prominent people continued to spend time with Epstein up until his arrest in 2019, even as sex trafficking accusations intensified after his 2008 \"sweetheart deal\" with prosecutors in Florida, which allowed Epstein to maintain his jet-set status relatively unscathed.",
      "The exact nature of the relationships are hard, if not impossible, to characterize based on the documents. What is clear is that Epstein's life had many dimensions beyond his criminal activity \u2014 including complex financial transactions and philanthropic activity that would have attracted many suitors. And he appears to have been a prolific networker.",
      "Among those spending considerable time in Epstein's orbit was filmmaker Woody Allen, who has said previously that his ties to Epstein were limited to social events at Epstein's home, always with Allen's wife present. Another recurring contact, Kathryn Ruemmler, a Goldman Sachs executive who was President Barack Obama's White House counsel, has said she only met with Epstein in a professional capacity.",
      "Appointment calendars through 2019 show several meetings with self-help guru Deepak Chopra and longevity expert Dr. Peter Attia. Details from Epstein's appointments during the final two years of his life had not previously been made public. They show he continued to plan meetings with people like political strategist Steve Bannon and Hyatt executive chairman Tom Pritzker.",
      "A love of cinema, with Woody Allen friendship at forefront",
      "Film screenings appear frequently on Epstein's calendar. He'd attend them and would also invite friends to watch movies in his home screening room. Among the most frequent of Epstein's social companions in the years leading up to his death was filmmaker Woody Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn. Epstein often went to Manhattan Film Center on Park Avenue in New York City to screen Allen's movies or watch him edit, documents show.",
      "The records show nearly 100 instances between 2014 and 2019 in which Allen and Epstein \u2014 almost always joined by Allen's wife \u2014 were scheduled to meet or spend time together. The documents show that Allen and Previn were among Epstein's most regular social companions during that period.",
      "A spokesperson for Allen told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 he \"never had a business meeting with Epstein and not once spent time with him without Soon-Yi also being present.\"",
      "When contacted by CBS News about the most recent calendar entries in Epstein's diary through 2019, Allen's spokesperson said no comment would be provided.",
      "Epstein's calendar notes travel with Allen and Previn at least nine times, including to his ranch in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and to his residence in Palm Beach, Florida. No allegations have been made that Allen or Previn knew about or were involved in any wrongdoing. In interviews, Allen has said that Epstein always had a girlfriend around him, but he did not believe those women were underage.",
      "A source familiar with the flight logs told CBS News that some of the flights with Allen and Previn also include the names of known victims who frequently traveled with Epstein, but those passenger names are redacted in the logs that were released.",
      "Allen provided film editing lessons to Epstein and others, according to Epstein's calendar. The calendar has a scheduled visit with Allen to the artist Jeff Koons' studio in New Jersey, though Koons told CBS News the visit never occurred. Epstein visited film sets where Allen was directing in New York and Rhode Island. Allen, Previn and Epstein were even scheduled to have dinner together on Valentine's Day in Paris one year.",
      "Epstein, Allen and Previn's final dinner together was May 9, 2019; the guest list included Kathy Ruemmler and another guest. Two months later, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Politics and business mixed in Epstein's calendar",
      "Epstein was known for being a connector; he frequently met with executives, CEOs and CFOs, and helped bring others together. On his calendar, he had meetings with business titans such as Barry Sternlicht, president of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, although a spokesperson for Sternlicht told CBS News the meeting never happened and he only attended one group dinner. He was scheduled to meet with Hyatt's Tom Pritzker 28 times between 2013 and 2018. Billionaire banker Ariane de Rothschild and the investor Leon Black and were also listed.",
      "Epstein also pulled politicians and operatives into the mix. The late New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson maintained a relationship with Epstein at least through Sept. 19, 2016, when they were scheduled to meet for dinner. He appears on Epstein's calendar and flight logs showing travel to Epstein's New Mexico ranch.",
      "A previously unreported log shows Richardson travelled in 2011 on Epstein's helicopter from the British Virgin Islands to the U.S. Virgin Islands. That flight log also lists Epstein and Brian Condit, Richardson's chief of staff, as a passenger, as well as three of Epstein's alleged victims, as identified by the House Oversight Committee, one with U.K. citizenship and two U.S. citizens.",
      "Condit told CBS News the chopper flight was from Richard Branson's island to the U.S. Virgin Islands. They did not visit the private property Epstein owned there, he said.\u00a0 He doesn't remember who else was on the helicopter. Richardson died at age 75 in 2023.",
      "Epstein was also in frequent contact with Ruemmler, the former Obama White House counsel who is currently chief legal officer and general counsel at the world's largest investment bank, Goldman Sachs. She has previously said, \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.\"",
      "Ruemmler was a partner at the law firm Latham & Watkins during the period she spent time with Epstein. Known for courting powerful people, Epstein often helped arrange business relationships. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs has said previously that was the extent of Ruemmler's cultivation of Epstein, leveraging him for business contacts and referrals.",
      "Epstein's calendar shows dozens of scheduled meetings and events involving Ruemmler. One note, for Feb. 6, 2018, says, \"Kathy Ruemmler to have the Glam Squad to her NY apt for 9am!\" It's unclear why Epstein was making note of the apparent hair and makeup appointment. Ruemmler declined to comment for this story.",
      "A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs told CBS News, \"As we've said before, and has been repeatedly reported, Ms. Ruemmler had a professional relationship with Mr. Epstein when she was the global chair of the white collar defense and investigations practice at Latham & Watkins.\"",
      "\"He referred business to her and they shared a common client that originated as an Epstein referral,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Their more than 50 scheduled meetings included appointments in Paris and St. Lucia and gatherings with some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world, including tech billionaire Peter Thiel, Bill Gates, former Sen. Bob Kerrey and Bannon. A spokesperson for Ruemmler denied she had ever flown with him and said she never met with Epstein outside of the U.S.",
      "Epstein's appointment calendar does not specify a purpose for his meetings with Bannon, a former White House chief strategist in the first Trump administration. Bannon has since said he filmed hours of interviews with Epstein as part of a planned documentary. A source who was close to Epstein in his final weeks told CBS News that Epstein was eager to portray himself in a redemptive light.",
      "Epstein's schedule remained packed with powerful and famous people even as federal agents closed in. In one week in April 2019, three months before his arrest, Epstein's calendar included meetings with Ruemmler, Bannon, investment banker and commentator Robert Kuhn and lunch with Chopra. Ruemmler's last appointments with Epstein were on May 6 and May 7, 2019.",
      "An obsession with longevity and medicine",
      "Epstein had a deep interest in medicine, science and longevity, both on a personal level and for business. Records obtained by CBS News show he had planned as early as 2012 to launch a company focused on gene sequencing.",
      "Chopra, the physician and prominent integrative medicine advocate, appears in Epstein's calendar at least a dozen times in 2016, 2017 and 2019.",
      "They were scheduled to meet one-on-one on some occasions \u2014 including at least one appointment in Paris in November 2016 \u2014 and in groups on other dates. Epstein was invited to a 25th anniversary event for Skeptic Magazine, in which Chopra was featured as a discussion panelist. Two months later, Epstein invited Chopra to a dinner with Allen and his wife.",
      "Chopra told CBS News in a statement, \"Jeffrey Epstein was introduced to me by Barnaby Marsh, former CEO of the Templeton Foundation, as someone who could potentially fund research on the brain and consciousness.\"",
      "Chopra said their appointments were primarily related to treatment for Epstein's struggles with sleep.",
      "\"After meeting, he shared he suffered from insomnia and expressed interest in learning meditation, which I taught him. Our meetings, focused solely on practicing meditation, lasted about 30 minutes each,\" Chopra said. \"At my suggestion, he also visited Dr. V.S. Ramachandran's lab at [the University of California San Diego] to learn about ongoing brain research.",
      "\"While several of these institutions had received some funding from him, no projects were ever initiated as a result of our interactions. He later introduced me to Joichi Ito at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ultimately, no research project was ever pursued.\"",
      "Epstein's difficulty sleeping is documented in jail records from the weeks before his death. He was provided a sleep apnea breathing device, commonly known as a CPAP machine, by the jail.",
      "Epstein also repeatedly met Peter Attia, a doctor specializing in longevity whose books have sold millions of copies.",
      "Attia's later appointments suggest Epstein was a patient. The schedule includes notations for blood draws and follow-ups over several years. Attia was also scheduled to attend what appears to be a business meeting with a medical entrepreneur and an investor associated with the Harvard Corporation, the powerful board that runs the university. CBS News has reached out to Attia for comment.",
      "Editor's note:\u00a0This story has been updated to include a statement from Ruemmler's spokesperson saying she never met with Epstein outside the country.",

    "summary": "The 2025 federal government shutdown, in the first year of Trump's second term, is one of the longest in U.S. history.",
    "story": [
      "The federal government is now in the midst of its second-longest shutdown, after Congress has repeatedly failed to pass a bill to fund the government on a temporary basis. The 2025 shutdown is a few days shy of the record set by the 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted 34 days and took place during President Trump's first administration.",
      "On Sept. 19, the House passed a measure that would have kept the government running through Nov. 21, but the bill failed to make it out of the GOP-led Senate the same day. Since government funding lapsed on Oct. 1, the Senate has held a number of votes, but Republicans have not been able to garner the support they need from Democrats to advance the bill.",
      "Here's the government shutdown by the numbers:",
      "13: Number of times the Senate has held failed votes to end the shutdown",
      "Since just before the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the Senate has voted 13 times on a House-passed resolution to fund the government until Nov. 21. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. When all senators are present, there have been 55 votes in favor of funding the government, five short of the 60 needed to move the bill forward.",
      "The Senate, which has 100 senators, requires only a simple majority to pass most legislation. But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators vote to end debate.",
      "52: Senate Republicans supporting resolution to fund the government and end the shutdown",
      "43: Senate Democrats/independents opposed, plus 1 Republican",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is the lone Republican joining most Democratic senators in voting against advancing the resolution to fund the government. He opposes the measure because it adds to the nation's rising debt.",
      "3: Senate Democrats/independents supporting resolution to fund the government and end the shutdown",
      "Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada have voted with Republicans in support of the measure, as has independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.",
      "5: Number of senators necessary to change their votes to advance the resolution",
      "\"We need five Democrats to show a little courage,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on Oct. 23, a day after the 12th vote failed. \"Reopen the government and let's get to work.\"",
      "42 million: The number of people who will lose food stamp benefits on Nov. 1",
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to data from the USDA. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. On Oct. 28, 25 states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Agriculture Department to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",
      "They argue the administration's decision to cut off food stamp payments is unlawful and threatens to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "$9.2 billion: The cost of funding food stamps for November",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says it would cost about $9.2 billion to keep SNAP benefits flowing next month. The Agriculture Department's contingency fund has around $5 billion, which Rollins has argued the administration doesn't have the legal ability to use.",
      "Some lawmakers from both parties have called for standalone legislation to fund SNAP.",
      "At least 670,000: Government workers who have been furloughed since the shutdown began",
      "According to the Bipartisan Policy Center's analysis of daily Treasury statements and the center's own workforce estimates, at least 670,000 federal employees are furloughed. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last month that compensation for furloughed workers is roughly $400 million per day.",
      "About 730,000: Federal employees who are working without pay",
      "Government workers who are determined to be essential are still working, albeit without pay, and there are about 730,000 of these employees, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "Over 4,000: Federal workers the government disclosed it was trying to lay off during shutdown",
      "On Oct. 28, a judge indefinitely barred the Trump administration from firing government employees due to the shutdown while a lawsuit challenging the effort makes its way through the courts.",
      "In mid-October, the administration already sent \"reduction in force\" layoff notices to over 4,000 federal employees across seven agencies.",
      "Here are the approximate numbers:",
      "$130 million: The private donation Trump says he's used to help pay the military",
      "President Trump says an unnamed \"patriot\" donated $130 million to fund troops' paychecks, which are normally cut off during shutdowns. The New York Times reported that donor is Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and scion to the Mellon family banking fortune.",
      "That nine-figure check likely isn't enough to cover the military's entire payroll. There are around 1.3 million active-duty service members, so the donation comes out to roughly $100 per person.",
      "At least $7 billion: The economic cost of the shutdown",
      "The shutdown could temporarily cut the nation's economic output by billions of dollars as unpaid federal workers curtail their spending and SNAP benefits are paused, leading to a 1-percentage-point GDP drop if the shutdown lasts four weeks and a 2-point dip if it drags on for eight weeks, the Congressional Budget Office said in an Oct. 29 estimate.",
      "Much of that decline will be reversed after the government reopens and the spigot of federal spending turns back on \u2014 but not all of it. The GDP will face a sustained drop of $7 billion after a four-week shutdown, $11 billion after six weeks and $14 billion after eight weeks, the CBO says.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump directed the Pentagon on Wednesday to resume testing of nuclear weapons \"on an equal basis\" with other countries' tests, possibly ending a decades-long U.S. pause that stretches back to the end of the Cold War.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied ancestor of the T. rex that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",

    "summary": "The new site is intended to \"help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
    "story": [
      "A former high-ranking homeland security official in the first Trump administration is launching a new online hub Wednesday to facilitate protests and other resistance efforts against President Trump and his policies.",
      "Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, is leading a group of dozens of former national security officials, whistleblowers and a bipartisan group of former elected officials to create a website called defiance.org.",
      "In its mission statement, the bipartisan group says the tool is \"designed to help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News, \"There are many organizations and a million efforts, but there has not been a clearinghouse for people who regularly seek ways to engage. This is a 'Google' for defiance, where people can go to see their options to push back lawfully, peacefully and defiantly.\"",
      "In September 2018, Taylor wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times that said there was a \"quiet resistance\" to President Trump within his own administration, made up of people \"working diligently\" to block what he called the president's \"worst inclinations.\" He disclosed two years later that he had written the op-ed.",
      "The announcement of the new site is intended to capitalize on momentum from the October \"No Kings\" rallies earlier this month, which attracted participants across the country.",
      "The site launched Wednesday with a video of actor Robert DeNiro, a staunch Trump critic, urging protesters and critics to join forces.",
      "\"You can't just sit on your ass and wait for the insanity and cruelty to pass. No,\" DeNiro says in the video. \"You gotta stand up and fight.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, \"Further proof that Miles Taylor's entire identity is being a TDS clown. If he actually cared about workers being paid and families receiving benefits, he would urge Democrats to reopen the government \u2013 just like the President has been doing. Democrats could end the shutdown today but Myles (sic) is too blinded by his TDS rage to accept the truth.\" (\"TDS\" is often used by Mr. Trump and his supporters as an initialism for \"Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" a phrase describing some of his critics)",
      "In April, Mr. Trump signed an executive memo targeting Taylor, accusing him of manufacturing stories to sell a book, and ordered DHS, the Justice Department and other government agencies to investigate him and revoke his security clearances, as well as for those who worked closely with him. Mr. Trump also ordered an investigation into the alleged dissemination of classified documents while Taylor worked for the government. Taylor denies he leaked any such material.",
      "Defiance.org is described in its mission statement as a \"nationwide 'mutual aid' pact to defend those under attack.\" It aims to support nonprofit partners, and says it will join \"peaceful protests and legal defense efforts.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News supporters of the effort include Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary from the first Trump administration, and former aide Olivia Troye, both of whom have become vocal critics of the president.",
      "Dozens of former elected leaders and Trump critics, including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman and Joe Walsh, are also supporting the new portal.",
      "Taylor said the mutual aid feature of the portal is intended to help those targeted by the administration. He said a future effort could include rallying legal, political and community leaders to support Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is under investigation by the Justice Department, if he is charged. Taylor said the Defiance.org hub would be used to galvanize and organize legal help, courthouse supporters and public statements in support of Schiff or against the Trump administration.",
      "Riggleman told CBS News the group would seek to \"protect Americans against political overreach and targeted retaliation.\"",
      "The White House has harshly criticized Taylor in the past, including in this statement in April.",
      "\"While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the federal government that 'vowed' to undermine and render effective (sic) a sitting President,\" the White House said.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We go now to the Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, who joins us this morning from Far Hills, New Jersey. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY:\u00a0 Hey, thanks, Margaret, good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So our CBS polling shows that there is real concern among Americans regarding the effect of the shutdown on all transportation. Should Americans also have safety concerns at this point?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I think that's a great question. We work overtime to make sure the system is safe. And we will slow traffic down, you'll see delays, we'll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe. But we have to be honest, when we have controllers, where we have shortages and towers and TRACONs doing two jobs, does it add more risk into the system? Sure, it does. But again, we're always managing that. Again, we don't- we don't want crashes, we want people to go safely, and so we will slow and stop traffic if we don't think we can manage it in a way that keeps people safe as they go from point A to point B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, I did see that the FAA said, up in New York, 80% of air traffic controllers were absent from New York area airports, and that same day, there was a near miss at LaGuardia Airport. One United plane clipped another one. Was that pilot error? Or was that linked to some kind of shortage?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, you mentioned the shortages of air traffic controllers in the New York airspace. We had a couple days ago, three hour delays throughout New York. And again, I haven't got the readout yet on whether that was pilot error. And usually, when these planes are- are traveling very close to each other, it's their job to stay away from one another. That's not controllers, it's usually pilot error. But again, I'll have to look and see what directive was given by the air traffic controllers. But it's normally the pilot's responsibility to stay away from aircraft on the tarmac.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So if this shutdown continues, how- when does it become an emergency in terms of passenger safety and the safety of those who are trying to, for example, get home for Thanksgiving in a few weeks.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No, we will stop traffic. So we're not going to let that happen. I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right? We've seen problems at LA, in Dallas, in DC, Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse. We have controllers who, some of them are new controllers. We have trainee controllers who are very helpful in the tower. They don't make a lot of money, and they're now confronted, they haven't had a paycheck for over a month. They're confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions. I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make. Let's open the government up. Let's pay these people, these young controllers. Margaret, it's really important, I think you've covered this, we don't have the best equipment in our towers and centers for air traffic control. But we have the safest airspace, we have the most efficient airspace because we have the best controllers in the world that work our skies and keep our people safe. They deserve a paycheck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, given that they are so essential, is there any way the administration can find a pot of money like seems to be getting found for others, like the military, to pay controllers so they can show up to work? Why isn't the administration able to do that?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I think that's a great question. So we have done all we can. President Trump has done all he can to minimize the pain of the shutdown on the American people. Again, you remember under Barack Obama's shutdown, he was trying to gate off open air monuments in Washington, DC, and were shutting down parks just walking paths. President Trump has tried to make it less painful on the American people. So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law. And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. That's fine, that's fair. But again, these people should be paid. And to say that it's Donald Trump's fault, to say he has to find money, when Democrats have said there's no money for you because we've shut the government down, I mean, that's a contorted analysis. And Democrats are trying to do that, and I don't think it really works. Give the money and we'll pay the controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I saw reports that air traffic controllers only received partial pay mid-October, and this past week they missed a paycheck altogether. So practically speaking, for those who are in these jobs, would you advise them to pick up part time work elsewhere?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, I'm clearly asking them, come to work. It is your job to come to work, and eventually you will be paid. But as I've traveled around the country and talked to air traffic controllers, they've told me that a lot of them can navigate missing one paycheck. None of them can manage missing two paychecks. And they're like every American family, everyone watching your show today as they think about their own finances, how many paychecks can they miss before it becomes real stress, real strife in their life? And so they're- at the- next week, they're going to get a notice of what their next paycheck is going to be. And if the government doesn't open, the notice will be another big fat zero, and you're going to see more of them probably make the decisions of funding their families, putting food on their table, gas in their cars, versus coming into work. That's not what I want, but I'm a realist as well, Margaret, these are the decisions of life and survival that these controllers have to make. By the way, it's the technicians, also. We have old equipment. We have technicians that work in the towers that keep the equipment operational. They're not getting paid. I have train inspectors who are working to keep our trains running and running safely. They're working without pay. I have pipeline inspectors, same thing. Across the system. We have a number of people who are working without pay. We talk about the air traffic controllers, but I have thousands of employees who are showing up, doing the work and trying to keep this system safe for the American people all the while they don't get paid to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Understood. So you said back on Fox Business on October 9 that \"I can't have people not showing up for work and that they may be let go.\" There's a shortage of 4,000 controllers already. You're not firing people, are you? You can't afford to.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, so when- we're 2-3,000 controllers short, but that's a huge number. And you make an interesting point, because I've tried to surge air traffic controllers into the system through our academy. Margaret, we're up 20% of controllers through the academy this year alone. It takes them about a year to two to get certified in a tower, but this shutdown is impacting my pipeline of controllers. And so as- when everyone forgets about air traffic control and the shutdown, I'm going to deal with the consequences of, again, delivering for the American people and getting more controllers in the towers, not less. And you bring up a good point. We're already stressed in that we don't have enough controllers in our system, and this shutdown, when we have staffing triggers where they're not coming in because they're funding their families and food on their tables, that makes it more difficult because we're already short long. Long term consequences--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not going to fire them?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I don't plan on firing control. No, listen, I have, no, I- again when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers. I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 All right. Secretary Duffy, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

      "The U.S. military has carried out another lethal strike on alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Saturday.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post, said a U.S.-designated terrorist organization allegedly operated the vessel but did not name which group was targeted. He said three people were killed in the strike.",

      "The news comes after the Pentagon announced on Oct. 24 that it would be sending the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, to the waters off Latin America. This move dramatically increased the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's\u00a0campaign\u00a0to counter narcotics traffickers.",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.

Four of the injured have been discharged from the hospital, he said. One other person had arrived at the hospital, taking the overall number injured in the attack to 11.",
      "Emergency services, including armed police and air ambulances,\u00a0were quick to arrive\u00a0on the scene shortly after they were alerted after 7:30 p.m. local time Saturday as the train drew into Huntingdon, a market town a few miles northwest of the university city of Cambridge. The two people were arrested at the station, which is around 75 miles north of London.",

      "In\u00a0a social media post, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the attack an \"appalling incident\" that was \"deeply concerning,\" and urged people in the area to \"follow the advice of the police.\"",
      "\"My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response,\" he wrote.",

      "One of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes to make landfall, Melissa has been blamed for at least 19 deaths in Jamaica, 31 in nearby Haiti, and at least one death in the Dominican Republic. Melissa made landfall in southwest Jamaica on Tuesday as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph.",
      "Health Minister Christopher Tufton recognized that the death toll in Jamaica was probably higher as many places are still hard to access, but said that it would be unwise to speculate.",
      "Less than half the island has communications, and nearly 400 water systems were knocked out by the storm.",
      "The U.S. Army\u00a0deployed\u00a0three CH-47 Chinook helicopters to Jamaica Friday for humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, with another five helicopters on the way.",

      "\"That facility will come fully equipped, which will include an operating theater and other critical diagnostic equipment, and some team members to support the local team,\" Tufton said in a briefing Saturday, according to AFP, adding that officials expect the hospital to be up and running in the coming week.",
      "There were desperate scenes in Montego Bay, as residents lined up to get food, water and cash. Many U.S. tourists are still working to make their way home. The Florida-based nonprofit Gray Bull Rescue Foundation found a way to get 341 American citizens back from two very hard-hit Montego Bay resorts.",
      "Essential relief supplies are now rolling into hurricane-stricken St. Elizabeth and Westmoreland, most of which had been cut off by fallen concrete posts and trees strewn across roads.",
      "But in some parts, people were forced to dip buckets into rivers, collecting the muddy water for everyday use, while others have been drinking coconut water and roasting breadfruit.",
      "In Westmoreland, mangled metal sheets, splintered wooden frames of houses and fragments of furniture littered the coastline.",
      "Social Security Minister Pearnel Charles Jr. was among several convoys of emergency responders en route to deliver ready-to-eat meals, water, tarpaulins, blankets, medicine and other essentials.",
      "\"The priority now is to get help to those who need it,\" said Charles Jr. during a brief stop en route to Black River for the first time with long-awaited relief supplies. Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Black River ground zero and said the town will have to be rebuilt.",
      "The Jamaica Defense Force set up a satellite disaster relief site at the Luana community center near Black River where care packages are being dispatched to hurricane-stricken residents.",
      "Many have been without vital supplies since Tuesday and quickly converged around a JDF truck as word spread that relief supplies were being distributed in the sweltering afternoon sun.",
      "\"Everyone is homeless right now,\" Rosemarie Gayle said. \"Thank you, thank you. I can't say thank you enough,\" she said, as she accepted a package of rice, beans, sardines, powdered milk, cooking oil and other essentials.",
      "Melissa has left devastation in its wake, snapping power lines and toppling buildings, disrupting food and water distribution and destroying crop fields.",
      "Satellite photographs showed the southwestern Jamaican fishing village of White House and the nearby town of Black River before and after Melissa slammed into the island. Each pair captures a once vibrant-looking town reduced to dirt and rubble.",
      "Some people have been walking for miles in search of basic goods and to check on loved ones, as more than 60% of the island remained without power. Helicopters have been dropping food in cut-off communities.",
      "\"People are in shock and they're waiting on relief,\" said World Vision's national director of domestic humanitarian and emergency affairs Mike Bassett, who traveled to the town of Santa Cruz in St. Elizabeth on Friday.",
      "\"The biggest needs are clean water, tarps for roof damage, canned proteins, hygiene and cleaning supplies,\" he said.",
      "On Saturday, the United Nations' World Food Program received 2,000 boxes of emergency food assistance shipped from Barbados, to be distributed in shelters and in the most-affected communities in the St. Elizabeth area.",
      "\"They will help meet the needs of 6,000 people for one week,\" said communications officer for WFP Alexis Masciarelli.",
      "Tufton also warned about the risk of increased mosquitoes, waterborne diseases and food poisoning. \"Please discard spoiled food,\" he said.",
      "A U.S. regional disaster assistance response team was on the ground after being activated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this week, the U.S. Embassy in Jamaica said.",
      "\"The United States stands with Jamaica as they respond to the impacts of the hurricane and remains prepared to swiftly deliver emergency relief items,\" it said.",
      "Jamaica's Water and Environment Minister Matthew Samuda took to the social media platform X in a desperate bid to find tarpaulin after Melissa tore off scores of roofs on homes in western Jamaica. X users chimed in to help, indicating where they had seen supplies.",
      "Falmouth, a popular fishing spot on Jamaica's north coast, had suffered significant damage including flooding and flattened buildings, Holness said on Saturday.",

      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",

      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what many saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of a visit by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

    "summary": "The pipeline supplies the Russian army with gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from refineries.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian forces\u00a0hit an important fuel pipeline in the Moscow region that supplies the Russian army, Ukraine's military intelligence said Saturday, as Russia kept up a sustained campaign of massive drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.",
      "The operation was carried out late Friday, according to a statement on the Telegram messaging channel. The agency, which is known by its acronym HUR, described it as a \"serious blow\" to Russia's military logistics.",
      "HUR said its forces struck the Koltsevoy pipeline, which spans 250 miles and supplies the Russian army with gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from refineries in Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Moscow.",
      "The operation, which targeted infrastructure near the Ramensky district, destroyed all three fuel lines, HUR said.",
      "The pipeline was capable of transporting up to 3 million tons of jet fuel, 2.8 million tons of diesel and 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, HUR said.",
      "\"Our strikes have had more impact than sanctions,\" said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of HUR, referring to international sanctions on Russia\u00a0imposed over its all-out war and the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Moscow strains to take key eastern city",
      "Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces defeated a team of Ukrainian special forces that were rushed to the eastern frontline hot spot of Pokrovsk in a bid to stop Russian troops from pushing farther into the city.",
      "It later posted videos showing two men it said were Ukrainians who surrendered in the embattled city. The videos show the men, one dressed in fatigues and the other in a dark green jacket, sat against a peeling wall in a dark room, as they speak of fierce fighting and encirclement by Russian forces. The videos' authenticity could not be independently verified, and there was no immediate public comment from Kyiv on the Russian ministry's claims.",
      "Russia and Ukraine have presented conflicting accounts of what is happening in Pokrovsk, a key Ukrainian stronghold in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed last week that his forces had encircled the city's Ukrainian defenders.",
      "But Ukraine's army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that while the situation in Pokrovsk remains \"hardest\" for Ukrainian forces, who are trying to push Russian troops out of the city, there is no encirclement or blockade as Moscow has maintained.",
      "\"A comprehensive operation to destroy and push out enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing. The main burden lies on the shoulders of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, particularly UAV operators and assault units,\" Syrskyi said in a statement on Telegram.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged on Friday that some Russian units had infiltrated Pokrovsk, but insisted that Ukraine is weeding them out.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russia had deployed around 170,000 troops in Donetsk in a major push to capture the city and claim a major battlefield victory.",
      "Putin is trying to persuade the United States, which wants him to seek a peace deal, that Ukraine can't hold out against Russian military superiority. He has also stressed what he says is Russia's improving nuclear capability as he refuses to budge from what he says are his country's legitimate war aims.",
      "A key goal for Moscow has been to take all of Ukraine's industrial heartland of Donbas, made up of the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. Kyiv still controls about a 10th of the coal-rich region.",
      "Russian nighttime strikes kill 1,\u00a0wound dozens",
      "Elsewhere, a civilian died and 19 more were wounded, including a 9-year-old girl, when Russia struck the southern Mykolaiv region with an Iskander ballistic missile on Saturday morning, local official Vitaliy Kim said.",
      "Another Russian strike early Saturday sparked a fire at a gas plant in the central Poltava region, Ukraine's emergency service reported.",
      "The strikes came as Russia pressed large drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, bringing power outages and restrictions across the country earlier this week in what Kyiv described as a \"systematic energy terror.\"",
      "Moscow launched 223 drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday, 206 of which were shot down, according to the Ukrainian air force. Seventeen struck targets in seven Ukrainian regions, the air force said, without providing details.",
      "Russia also hit an agricultural enterprise in Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region, injuring a 66-year old woman, according to a Telegram update by regional government official Viacheslav Chaus.",
      "Russian forces during the night shot down or intercepted 98 Ukrainian drones over the country, including six on the approach to Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday.",
      "There were no immediate reports of casualties, but local authorities reported a rare large-scale power outage in a Russian city of over 100,000 people. The municipal administration of Zhukovsky, 25 miles southeast of Moscow, in a Telegram update blamed the blackout on an \"automatic equipment shutdown.\"",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he told Ontario's premier not to run an anti-tariff ad that prompted President Trump to\u00a0end trade talks with Canada.",
      "Carney also confirmed that he apologized to the president during a dinner at\u00a0the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit this week because Mr. Trump was \"offended.\"",
      "Ontario's television advertisement that aired in the U.S. criticizes Mr. Trump's tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S.\u00a0President Ronald Reagan.",
      "The ad infuriated Mr. Trump, who ended trade talks with Canada and said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%.",
      "When asked on Saturday what Ontario Premier Doug Ford's response was to being asked not to run the ad, Carney said, \"Well, you saw what came of it.\"",
      "\"It's not something I would have done,\" Carney added at a news conference as he wrapped a nine-day trip to Asia.",
      "Ford is a populist Conservative, while Carney is a Liberal. As premier, Ford is the equivalent of a U.S. governor.",

      "Mr. Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad, spelling out the case against them, saying tariffs work \"only for a short time\" and \"hurt every American worker and consumer.\"",
      "\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan\u00a0said, as quoted by the ad.",
      "Mr. Trump has complained that the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled this month that could decide whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.",
      "Carney met with Mr. Trump at the White House last month and has been trying to secure a trade deal to lower some tariffs on sectors like steel and aluminum. Tariffs are taking a toll on the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 13:18:31 -0400",
    "summary": "The Grand Egyptian Museum has taken 30 years to become a reality, but finally opened its doors, with an equally grand opening ceremony.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0Egypt's government hosted dozens of foreign leaders and dignitaries on Saturday as it held an official opening ceremony for the Grand Egyptian Museum, a $1 billion project decades in the making that was plagued by multiple delays and a ballooning of the budget.",
      "The GEM is one of the largest museums in the world, and the largest dedicated to a single civilization: ancient Egypt. Its subject matter spans some 7,000 years, from prehistory to the end of the Greek and Roman eras around 400 A.D.",
      "\"It is a great day for Egypt and for humanity. This is Egypt's gift to the world. It's a dream come true, after all these years, the GEM is finally and officially open,\" Nevine El-Aref, media adviser to the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, told CBS News.",
      "The initial cost for the more than 5-million-square-foot, triangular-themed structure about a mile from the iconic pyramids of Giza was estimated at $500 million, but the final price tag was more than double that. Costing over $1 billion, the\u00a0project was funded through Egyptian resources and international cooperation.",
      "In front of the main entrance stands the imposing 53-foot-high Hanging Obelisk, the only such structure in the world. The obelisk itself is about 3,500 years old, but it sits suspended overhead on a modern structure with a glass floor, so visitors can peer up and view its ancient inscriptions from an angle never before possible.",
      "Beyond is the Grand Staircase, with 108 steps bringing people up the equivalent of six floors to the main galleries, with colossal statues on view the whole way up.",
      "The GEM has 12 primary exhibition halls, covering about 194,000 square feet.",
      "The number of artifacts on display has nearly doubled initial expectations thanks to Egypt's wealth of antiquities, with officials saying about 100,000 items will be housed in the halls.",
      "To put that in perspective, if a visitor were to spend one minute looking at each artifact on display in the museum, it would take almost 70 sleepless days to view the entire collection.",
      "The museum's triangular architecture radiates outward from its entrance toward the three main pyramids of Giza, aligning perfectly with their positions. Its walls and sloping ceilings follow the same lines, rising toward the pyramids' highest points, but not exceeding the height of the ancient structures, out of respect for their builders.",
      "The museum's interior offers stunning panoramic views of the pyramids. The concept may sound simple, but it required a significant reshaping of the local topography, including the excavation and removal of some 79 million cubic feet of sand, which took workers seven months.",
      "King Ramses II was there first",
      "In the entrance courtyard of the GEM, stands a massive, 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II. The statue was moved in 2006 from a busy square in central Cairo to a site near the Great Pyramids, where it stood awaiting the new landmark museum's construction.",
      "The 83-ton statue's journey took 10 hours, processing slowly through the streets of Egypt under heavy security as people watched on TV.",
      "Later Ramses was moved to a new permanent home, about 400 yards away, and the museum was built around it.",
      "King Tut's complete collection",
      "The GEM's main attraction, it could be argued, is the complete collection of the famous King Tutankhamun, the golden boy.",
      "All 5,398 items from the tomb of the 13th pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt, who ruled from around 1333 to 1323 B.C., will be displayed together in one place for the first time since they were discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.",
      "The new showroom is six times the size of the one that previously housed much of the Tut collection, at the old Egyptian Museum in central Cairo.",
      "King Khufu's Boats",
      "The GEM also boasts the King Khufu's Boats Museum, showing the 4,500-year-old the boats that were designed to be used in the journey to the afterlife.",
      "The two royal boats were discovered in 1954 near the Pyramid of Khufu. It took experts more than 10 years to reassemble the first boat. It is now fully reconstructed and was moved to the museum in 2021. Visitors of the museum can also view the conservation work underway on the second one.",
      "Scholars believe they were either used in Khufu's funeral procession or they were intended for his journey with the sun god Re in the afterlife.",
      "The long road to the Grand Egyptian Museum",
      "The idea for a grand museum on this site in Egypt dates back more than 32 years. The government first allocated 117 acres for the project at the location in 1992.",
      "At the very beginning of 2002, Egypt launched a massive international architectural competition to find a winning design for the museum. A total of 2,227 architects from 103 countries applied to submit designs, and by August of that year, 1,550 from 83 countries had submitted conceptual drawings.",
      "A couple months later officials had whittled the options down to only 20 designs to put forward for a second stage. In July 2003, the prize - and the massive contract - was awarded to the Irish architectural firm Heneghan Peng.",
      "The plan was originally for the museum to open in 2010, but a series of events, including financial crises, political uprisings, the COVID-19 pandemic and regional wars, delayed the curtain raising.",
      "A total of 79 official delegations are expected to participate in the opening ceremony, including 39 delegations headed by kings, princes, and heads of state and government, a spokesman for the presidency said.",
      "Egyptian officials hope the new museum will boost the country's tourism industry, and with it, the still-struggling economy. They have predicted that the GEM will attract some 5 million visitors per year.",

      "The remains of three people handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross this week did not belong to any of the hostages, an Israeli source told CBS News on Saturday. It is the latest setback that could undermine the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between\u00a0Israel and Hamas.",
      "The unidentified remains of the three people were returned late Friday to Israel, where they were examined overnight. At the time, a military official told the Associated Press that Israeli intelligence suggested they did not belong to any of the hostages taken by Hamas terrorists during the Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack in southern Israel that sparked the war. The Israeli official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Saturday confirmed that the remains did not belong to any of the hostages, without giving further details, the Associated Press reported. CBS News has reached out to Netanyahu's office for additional comment.",
      "The Israeli army declined to comment to CBS News on Saturday, saying it did not announce it received the bodies.",
      "\"The reports in question were not issued by us, therefore, we won't confirm their accuracy,\" an IDF spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "Hamas' armed wing said in a subsequent statement on Saturday that it had offered to hand over samples on Friday of unidentified bodies, but that Israel had refused to receive them and asked for the remains for examination.",
      "\"We handed the bodies over to stop the claims of Israel,\" the statement said.",
      "It's unclear who the remains belonged to.",
      "Since the\u00a0U.S.-brokered ceasefire\u00a0between Israel and Hamas took effect on Oct. 10, Palestinian militants have released the remains of 17 hostages that were held in Gaza for the past two years.",
      "But the process of returning the bodies of the last 11 remaining hostages, as called for under the truce deal, is progressing slowly, with militants releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",
      "The total number of Palestinian bodies returned by Israel since the ceasefire began stands at 225. Only 75 of those have been identified by families, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry. It is unclear if those returned were killed in Israel during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, whether they died in Israeli custody as detainees or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas released\u00a0all living Israeli hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and wartime detainees. Israel pulled back its troops to a designated line within Gaza, halted its military offensive and increased aid into the territory.",
      "The fragile truce faced its\u00a0biggest challenge\u00a0earlier this week when Israel carried out strikes across Gaza that killed more than 100 people, following the killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, and the incomplete return of hostages.",

      "The wealthy emirate is known for its extravagant ventures, including an enormous mall with an indoor ski area, the world's tallest building and an artificial island dotted with five-star hotels.",
      "\"The wait is finally over,\" Serkan Sagsoz, co-founder of the Julith cafe with the pricey offering,\u00a0said in a Facebook video. \"The world's most celebrated and highest graded coffee of all time has arrived at Julith.\"",
      "Located in an industrial neighborhood that has become a hotspot for coffee lovers, Julith plans to serve \"around 400 cups\" of the precious beverage starting on Saturday, Sagsoz told AFP.",
      "\"We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,\" Sagsoz said.",
      "For a price tag of 3,600 dirhams (around $980), the brew offers an experience of floral and fruity flavors reminiscent of tea.",
      "\"There are white floral notes like jasmine, citrus flavors like orange and bergamot and a hint of apricot and peach,\" said Sagsoz, who previously ran a cafe in his native Turkey.",
      "\"It's like honey, delicate and sweet,\" he said.",

      "It claimed to have paid the highest price ever for coffee.",
      "Twenty kilograms of the beans went for around 2.2 million dirhams, or $600,000, Julith said in a press release.",
      "Asian buyers, Emirati coffee enthusiasts and coffee bean collectors have since reached out to the cafe in the hopes of securing some of the \"Nido 7 Geisha\" beans, which are grown on a plantation near Panama's Baru volcano.",
      "But the cafe said it does not plan to share its treasure, beyond a small amount reserved for Dubai's ruling family.",
      "Coffee prices surging in U.S.",
      "The pricey cup of coffee is being offered as the cost of roasted coffee has jumped 18.9% in the U.S., according to the most recent Consumer Price Index data for September.",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data\u00a0shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are driving this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, is depressing crop yields, Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023, the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according\u00a0to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, which has led producers there to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",

      "The Trump administration on Thursday announced it would set the lowest refugee admissions cap in U.S. history, allocating just 7,500 spots for this fiscal year, mostly for Afrikaners who it has claimed are facing racial discrimination in South Africa for being White.",
      "The previous lowest refugee ceiling was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.",
      "The announcement Thursday is the latest effort by Mr. Trump and his top aides to dramatically scale back the decades-old U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, a humanitarian policy for vulnerable people fleeing war and violence across the world that once enjoyed robust bipartisan support.",
      "Mr. Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program hours after taking office for a second time earlier this year, citing strains on American communities receiving the refugees and concerns about the vetting process. Weeks later, his administration made an exemption for Afrikaners, calling them victims of racial oppression.",
      "In an order posted on the federal government's journal of regulations, Mr. Trump said the 7,500 refugee spots for fiscal year 2026 would \"primarily be allocated among Afrikaners\" and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" Fiscal year 2026 started on Oct. 1 and culminates at the end of September 2026.",

      "The prioritization of Afrikaners \u2014 while refugees from places like Afghanistan, Myanmar and Sudan plagued by ethnic violence and armed conflict are being blocked from entering the U.S. \u2014 has led to accusations of preferential treatment among refugee advocates.",
      "Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, one of several national groups that traditionally have worked with the U.S. government to resettle refugees, said Mr. Trump's decision \"lowers our moral standing.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa brought hurricane-force gusts to Bermuda overnight, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said Friday. The storm brought heavy rains and winds to the Bahamas Thursday after slamming eastern Cuba and Jamaica earlier in the week.",
      "A hurricane warning for Bermuda has now been discontinued.",
      "Melissa was\u00a0one of the strongest hurricanes\u00a0ever recorded in the Atlantic basin when it reached Jamaica Tuesday afternoon as a Category 5 storm. The 13th named storm of the Atlantic season didn't have any direct impact on the U.S. mainland.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "The storm's wind speeds dropped after its landfalls over Jamaica and Cuba, and its winds had weakened further to 90 mph when the hurricane center issued its 2 a.m. EDT advisory Friday. That made Melissa a Category 1, the lowest on the\u00a0Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Melissa still had 90 mph winds three hours later.",
      "By that time, the NHC said, Melissa's core was about 255 miles north of Bermuda and it was hurrying northeast at 41 mph through the Atlantic's cooler waters.",
      "The storm is expected to pass to the south of Newfoundland, Canada, as a post-tropical cyclone and continue to weaken over the weekend.",
      "High swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions of Hispaniola (the island shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti), Cuba, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Bermuda during the next couple of days, and will also reach the Northeast U.S. coast. The hurricane center warns of the risk of \"life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\"",
      "Climate change has been fueling the storm",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.",
      "\"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now \u2014 around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,\" Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. \"And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.\"",
      "Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise make storm surge more intense.",
      "Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph.",
      "\"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,\" Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told the AP.",

      "Melissa came ashore just west of Black River on Tuesday as\u00a0one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record, leaving up to 90% of all structures in the town without roofs as it snapped power lines and toppled concrete structures.",
      "The storm was being blamed for at least 51 deaths, mostly in Haiti and Jamaica. It also hit Cuba hard. Authorities said 19 people were killed in Jamaica, at least 31 in Haiti and at least one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Melissa was over the open waters of the Atlantic after racing past Bermuda\u00a0early Friday, packing 90 mph maximum sustained winds, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It became a post-tropical cyclone by late Friday morning, the center said.",
      "In Jamaica, helicopters hovered over isolated communities, dropping food as crews rushed to reopen roads.",
      "\"You are not forgotten,\" said Daryl Vaz, energy and transport minister.",
      "Christopher Boxe, a restaurant owner in Kingston, Jamaica, noted the stark differences in how various parts of the island fared.",
      "\"This morning has felt like we live in two Jamaicas, you know, Jamaica, where, like most people are going to work in Kingston and their homes have minimal damage, and then you have the other half, which looks just devastated. And it's heartbreaking,\" he told CBS News.",
      "More than 7,000 people remained in shelters, with 66% of the island without power and around half of the nation's water systems offline, officials said at a news conference Friday. People clutched cash as they formed long lines at the few gas stations and supermarkets open in affected areas.",
      "Officials said the dead in Jamaica included a child, and they expected the death toll to keep rising. In one isolated community, residents pleaded with officials to remove the body of a victim tangled in a tree. On Thursday, dozens of U.S. search-and-rescue experts landed in Jamaica along with their dogs.",
      "No reported deaths but Cuba far from spared",
      "In Cuba, heavy equipment began to clear blocked roads and highways and the military helped rescue people trapped in isolated communities and at risk from landslides.",
      "No deaths were reported after the Civil Defense evacuated more than 735,000 people across eastern Cuba ahead of the storm. Residents were slowly starting to return home Thursday.",
      "The town of El Cobre in the eastern province of Santiago de Cuba was one of the hardest hit. Home to some 7,000 people, it is also the site of the Basilica of Our Lady of Charity, the patron saint of Cuba who is deeply venerated by Catholics and practitioners of Santer\u00eda, an Afro-Cuban religion.",
      "\"We went through this very badly. So much wind, so much wind. Zinc roofs were torn off. Some houses completely collapsed. It was a disaster,\" said Odalys Ojeda, a 61-year-old retiree, as she looked up at the sky from her living room, where the roof and other parts of the house were torn away.",
      "Even the basilica was hit.",
      "\"Here at the sanctuary, the carpentry, stained glass and even the masonry suffered extensive damage,\" Father Rogelio Dean Puerta said.",
      "A televised Civil Defense meeting chaired by President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel didn't provide an official estimate of the damage. However, officials from the affected provinces \u2014 Santiago, Granma, Holgu\u00edn, Guant\u00e1namo and Las Tunas \u2014 reported losses of roofs, power lines and fiber optic telecommunications cables, as well as roads cut off, isolating communities, and heavy losses in banana, cassava and coffee plantations.",
      "Many communities were still without electricity, internet and telephone service because of downed transformers and power lines.",
      "In an unusual statement on Thursday, the U.S. State Department said Washington was \"ready to assist the Cuban people.\" It said the U.S. \"is prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance directly and through local partners who can deliver it more effectively to those in need.\"",
      "The statement didn't specify how the cooperation would be coordinated or whether contact had been made with the Cuban government, with which it maintains a bitter conflict that includes six decades of economic and financial sanctions.",
      "Haiti reeling",
      "Melissa also unleashed catastrophic flooding in Haiti, where authorities reported at least 31 people killed and 21 others missing, mostly in the country's southern region. More than 15,000 people also remained in shelters.",
      "\"It is a sad moment for the country,\" said Laurent Saint-Cyr, president of Haiti's transitional presidential council.",
      "He said officials expect the death toll to rise and noted that the government was mobilizing resources to search for people and provide emergency relief.",

    "summary": "NATO and U.S. allies try to assuage fears over bolstering Russia as the Pentagon announces a U.S. troop reduction in Eastern Europe.",
    "story": [
      "NATO and some of America's allies in the transatlantic alliance have sought to ease concerns over the Trump administration's move to reduce the U.S. military's presence in Europe amid Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine and as it's accused of ramping up hybrid warfare against NATO nations.",
      "The Pentagon announced Thursday that it was reducing the number of U.S. troops deployed in Eastern Europe. U.S. officials told CBS News that around 700 U.S. airborne troops who have been deployed in Germany, Romania and Poland\u00a0would come home and not be replaced.",
      "In a statement, the U.S. Army Europe and Africa said it was part of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's \"deliberate process to ensure a balanced U.S. military force posture,\" and \"not an American withdrawal from Europe or a signal of lessened commitment to NATO and Article 5. Rather this is a positive sign of increased European capability and responsibility.\"",
      "\"Our NATO allies are meeting President Trump's call to take primary responsibility for the conventional defense of Europe,\" the Army said. \"This force posture adjustment will not change the security environment in Europe.\"",
      "NATO and allies stress \"U.S.'s continued commitment\" to Europe",
      "On Thursday, appearing keen to ease such concerns, Estonian Minister of Defense Hanno Pevkur said in a statement that the U.S. had \"made a significant decision to maintain its military presence in Estonia, reaffirming the U.S.'s continued commitment to the defense of the region and\u00a0NATO's entire eastern flank.\"",
      "\"We are working to further strengthen the U.S. military presence in our region,\" he added.",
      "In September, Estonia said Russian military jets had violated the country's airspace for\u00a012 minutes, just days after Poland said more than 20 Russian drones\u00a0entered its airspace. This week, Lithuania closed its border with Russia's close ally Belarus, after accusing both countries of a \"deliberate escalation of hybrid warfare.\"",
      "NATO says deterrence measures along its eastern flank have been \"massively reinforced\" over the last decade \"as a direct result of Russia's behavior.\" That boundary runs from the Arctic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.",
      "The reinforcements include U.S. troops, but the Trump administration has pushed its European NATO allies hard to take more responsibility \u2014 and bear more of the financial burden \u2014 for their own security, announcing earlier this year that it would make the Indo-Pacific a primary foreign policy focus, rather than Europe, despite the ongoing war in Ukraine.",
      "\"The decision was expected,\" Romania's Ministry of Defense said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Wednesday, referring to the announcement of the U.S. troop reduction.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to NATO\u00a0Matthew Whitaker said\u00a0in a social media post that America's partnership with Romania \"remains stronger than ever,\" and reiterated the Pentagon's message that it was in response to European forces' increased capacities.",
      "The reassurances have not quelled debate about whether the move could be just the beginning of a wider U.S. withdrawal from Europe. The Ukrainian newspaper\u00a0Kyiv Post\u00a0reported Friday that further American troop reductions are expected, with troops to be pulled from Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary by the end of the year.",
      "There was no immediate public response to the report from the Pentagon or the Trump administration.",
      "NATO has also sought to ease concerns, with a senior military official from the alliance telling CBS News on Thursday that, \"even with this adjustment, the U.S. force posture in Europe remains larger than it has been for many years.\"",
      "\"U.S. commitment to NATO is clear,\" the official said. \"President Trump and his administration have reiterated this time and again. NATO has robust defense plans in place and we are working to ensure we maintain the right forces and capabilities in place to deter and defend each other.\"",
      "Concern in Washington, from both sides of the aisle",
      "The announcement drew bipartisan criticism in Washington, with some senior lawmakers warning it could embolden Russia and undermine the NATO alliance.",
      "In a\u00a0joint statement\u00a0issued Thursday by the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, the chairmen of that committee and the corresponding Senate body \u2014 both Republicans \u2014 said they strongly opposed the change in the U.S. deployment in Romania, which they said \"appears uncoordinated and directly at odds with the President's strategy.\"",
      "Senator Roger Wicker and Representative Mike Rogers, in the statement, also indicated that they believed the Pentagon could make further reductions to the U.S. deployment in Europe.",
      "\"We strongly oppose the decision not to maintain the rotational U.S. brigade in Romania and the Pentagon's process for its ongoing force posture review that may result in further drawdowns of U.S. forces from Eastern Europe,\" said the Republican lawmakers.",
      "\"On March 19, we\u00a0stated\u00a0that we will not accept significant changes to our warfighting structure that are made without a rigorous interagency process, coordination with combatant commanders and the Joint Staff, and collaboration with Congress,\" said Wicker and Rogers. \"Unfortunately, this appears to be exactly what is being attempted.\"",
      "On Thursday, Rep. Mike Turner, also a Republican and the head of the U.S. delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, said he was \"concerned by reports of reductions of US forces in Romania.\"",
      "\"Congress has been clear that US force posture across Europe must remain robust and resolute. Russia's aggressive actions against Eastern Flank countries through intentional airspace incursions underscores Russia's ambition beyond Ukraine,\" said Turner. \"It is in our national security interests to support our NATO Allies as they rightly ramp up their investments in their defense capabilities.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\u00a0called the decision\u00a0to reduce the U.S. presence in the region \"deeply misguided\" in a statement released Thursday.",

      "None of the French crown jewels stolen in the brazen daytime robbery of the landmark Louvre Museum had been located 10 days after the heist, the Paris prosecutor said Wednesday, and\u00a0two suspects detained so far\u00a0were formally charged with theft and conspiracy to commit a crime.",
      "\"I want to remain hopeful that [the jewels] will be found and they can be brought back to the Louvre, and more broadly to the nation,\" Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau told reporters.",
      "She said the two suspects, who were arrested Saturday, partially admitted to a role in the heist.",
      "The jewels date back hundreds of years and are considered national treasures with an estimated value of some $102 million. Experts have told CBS News the elaborate pieces of jewelry may have already been broken down into their component parts, greatly diminishing their value, and they may never be found.",
      "At least four people in total were seen on security camera video taking part in the robbery on Oct. 19, and Beccuau said at a news conference in the French capital on Wednesday afternoon that her office could not rule out the culprits being part of a larger criminal gang.",
      "Dozens of detectives have been on the trail of the four thieves, who used a cherry picker lift and cutting gear to break into a first-floor gallery at the world-renowned museum and then fled with the jewels.",
      "But few details have emerged so far about how investigators have managed to track down the culprits, some of whom wore balaclavas and high-visibility vests.",
      "The two men charged in connection with the heist will remain in custody and await a trial.",
      "A source close to the case this weekend said the men in their 30s were known to the police for committing thefts, and Beccuau said they were believed to be the ones who actually broke into the museum gallery, based, in part, on DNA evidence.",
      "The two men hailed from Seine-Saint-Denis, a region just outside Paris, and one was arrested as he was about to board a plane for Algeria, the source said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",

      "\"They lack the \u2018specificity, imminence, and likelihood of producing lawless action\u2019 required to fall outside constitutional protection,\" the attorneys said.",
      "The jury acquittal, which was handed down quickly after a two-day trial in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, came at a time when political violence has taken the spotlight, particularly in the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination and a string of recent violence toward immigration enforcement officers, and as Republican and Democratic political figures continuously face threats.",
      "A person convicted of attempting to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh had taken concrete steps by searching the internet for mass shootings, discussing killing a Supreme Court justice in internet chats and showing up armed at Kavanaugh\u2019s house in 2022.",
      "A man who participated in the Jan. 6 riot was convicted by a judge in a separate case of firearms charges and making a hoax threat aimed at former President Barack Obama. He was sentenced this week to time served after he livestreamed himself driving around the former president's neighborhood and saying he was \"working on a detonator.\" He was found with a machete and illegal weapons.",
      "In a looming constitutional test, another man is facing charges of threatening federal judges by sending hundreds of ominous messages through the Supreme Court website referencing several justices\u2019 graphic murders. He tried to have his case tossed out over First Amendment concerns, but a judge denied the request, saying a jury would need to weigh that argument.",

      "Presidents, senators, House lawmakers and members of the judiciary routinely speak about facing a range of threats, whether in public forums or through direct messages.",
      "One legal test in these cases came in 1969, when the Supreme Court decided in favor of a protester who allegedly had told a group of people while discussing getting drafted for the Vietnam War that if he was handed a rifle, the first man he wanted to kill was President Lyndon Johnson. His remark was political hyperbole rather than a \"true threat,\" the high court found.",
      "\"What is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech,\" the majority wrote. \"The language of the political arena . . . is often vituperative, abusive, and inexact.\"",
      "Stinson was initially charged with two counts of a threat against the president, but the DOJ shifted course and brought the one solicitation charge against him.",
      "DOJ lawyers argued that Stinson's incessant violent comments on X and Bluesky, coupled with self-identifying as an Antifa member, met the charging criteria, but prosecutors failed to convince a jury that the speech was more than bluster.",
      "In the case of Kirk's murder, finger-pointing ensued. Republicans blamed inflammatory rhetoric from Kirk's political opponents for inciting his death.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi stirred the conversation by saying in an interview after Kirk's death that the DOJ would \"absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.\" Bondi later walked back her comment, saying speech that \"crosses the line into threats of violence\" is punishable by law.",

      "\"Incitement is more about the imminence. . . . How much time would have to pass between that person\u2019s speech and the actual unlawful act of the violence?\" VanderVeen said, noting that inciting violence typically involves addressing a mob.",
      "\"If someone\u2019s saying, \u2018Violence is good,\u2019 but there\u2019s no imminent lawless action there, someone else has to say, \u2018That guy\u2019s right, that violence is good. I\u2019m going to start doing violence,'\" VanderVeen said. \"At that point, that\u2019s on the person doing the violence.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "A security researcher found a serious weakness in the software that powers thousands of e-commerce sites. The platform, called Magento, and its paid version Adobe Commerce, has a bug that lets attackers break into active shopping sessions. Some attackers can even take control of the entire store.",
      "The flaw is known as SessionReaper. It allows hackers to pretend they are real customers without needing a password. Once they are inside, they can steal data, make fake orders, or install tools that collect credit card details.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "Why is this attack so serious?",
      "The problem starts in the part of the system that handles how a store communicates with other online services. Because the software does not properly check the information it receives, it sometimes trusts data that it should not. Hackers take advantage of this by sending fake session files that the store accepts as real.",
      "Researchers at SecPod warn that successful attacks can lead to stolen customer data, fake purchases and even full control of the store's server.",
      "Once the attack method was shared publicly, cybercriminals began using it right away. Security experts at Sansec reported that more than 250 online stores were compromised within a single day. This shows how quickly attacks can spread once a vulnerability becomes public.",
      "Hackers are exploiting a new flaw called SessionReaper to hijack active shopping sessions on thousands of e-commerce sites running Adobe Commerce and Magento. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Why are many stores still unprotected?",
      "Adobe released a security update on Sept. 9 to fix the issue. Weeks later, about 62% of affected stores still have not installed it. Some store owners are afraid an update might break features on their site. Others simply do not know how serious the risk is.",
      "Every unpatched store remains an open door for attackers who want to steal information or install malicious code.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "How can you stay safe when shopping online?",
      "While store owners are responsible for fixing the problem, you can still take smart steps to protect yourself when shopping online. These actions can help you spot danger early and keep your personal information safe.",
      "Always pay attention to how a website behaves. If a page looks odd, loads slowly or shows error messages, it could mean something is wrong behind the scenes. Check for the small padlock symbol in the address bar that shows the site uses HTTPS encryption. If it is missing or the site redirects you to an unfamiliar page, stop and close the browser tab immediately. Trust your instincts if something feels off.",
      "Cybercriminals often use fake promotional emails or ads that look like real store offers. Instead of clicking links in messages or banners, type the store's web address directly into your browser to avoid phishing pages designed to steal your login details or card information. Since attacks like SessionReaper can expose your personal data to criminal marketplaces, consider using a reputable data removal service that continuously scans and deletes your private information, such as your address, phone number and email, from data broker sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft if your information has been leaked through a compromised online store.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Strong antivirus protection is your silent guard online. Choose reputable software that offers real-time protection, safe browsing alerts and automatic updates. A strong antivirus program can detect malicious code that tries to run on your device, block unsafe sites and alert you to potential threats. This adds another crucial layer of defense when visiting online stores that may not be fully secure.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Whenever possible, choose payment services that add an extra layer of protection between your bank account and the online store. Platforms like PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay do not share your card number with the retailer. This reduces the chance of your information being stolen if the store is compromised. These payment gateways also offer dispute protection if a purchase turns out to be fraudulent.",
      "Stick to stores with a solid reputation. Well-known brands usually have better security and faster response times when issues arise. Before buying from a new website, check its reviews on trusted consumer sites. Look for signs of credibility such as clear contact information, a professional design and verified payment options. A few minutes of research can save you from weeks of frustration.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Updates may seem annoying, but they are one of the most effective ways to protect your data. Make sure your computer, smartphone and web browser all have the latest security patches installed. Updates often fix the exact kinds of flaws hackers use to spread attacks like SessionReaper. Enable automatic updates if you can, so your devices stay protected without extra effort.",
      "If you create accounts on shopping sites, make sure each one has its own strong password. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager to generate and store long, random passwords. That way, if one account is compromised, your other logins stay safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "If a site or payment service offers\u00a0two-factor authentication, enable it. This adds a second security step, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. Even if hackers steal your password, they will not be able to access your account without that second verification.",
      "Even weeks after Adobe issued a critical patch for the SessionReaper vulnerability, nearly two-thirds of affected online stores remain unprotected, leaving customer data and payment information at high risk of theft. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks\u00a0in places like caf\u00e9s, airports and hotels are often unsecured. Avoid entering payment information or logging in to accounts while connected to public networks. If you must make a purchase while away from home, use a mobile data connection or a reliable VPN to encrypt your activity.",
      "Check your financial statements regularly for any unusual activity. Small, unauthorized charges can be early signs of fraud. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank or credit card company right away so they can freeze your account or issue a new card.",
      "If you notice anything strange during or after an online purchase, act quickly. Contact the store's customer service to report what you saw. You should also inform your payment provider or credit card company so they can block unauthorized transactions. Reporting early can help stop further damage and alert other shoppers to potential risks.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The SessionReaper attack shows how fast online threats can appear and how long they can linger when updates are ignored. Even well-known stores can become unsafe overnight. For retailers, installing patches quickly is critical. For shoppers, staying alert and choosing secure payment methods are the best ways to stay protected.",

    "summary": "Cybersecurity expert shares six essential steps to protect against dark web threats, including data removal services, password managers and antivirus software.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn about a disturbing new scam where criminals use AI to clone the voices of loved ones and trick victims into sending money.",
      "The dark web often feels like a mystery, hidden beneath the surface of the internet that most people use every day. But to understand how scams and cybercrimes actually work, you need to know what happens in those hidden corners where criminals trade data, services and stolen access.",
      "Cybercriminals rely on a structured underground economy, complete with marketplaces, rules and even dispute systems to operate safely away from law enforcement. By learning how these systems function, you can better understand the threats that could reach you and avoid becoming the next target.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Learn how to protect your personal information from dark web threats with simple cybersecurity habits and tools. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the hidden layers of the internet",
      "The internet is often divided into three layers: the clear web, the deep web and the dark web. The clear web is the open part of the internet that search engines like Google or Bing can index, including news sites, blogs, stores and public pages. Beneath it lies the deep web, which includes pages not meant for public indexing, such as corporate intranets, private databases and webmail portals. Most of the content in the deep web is legal but simply restricted to specific users.",
      "The dark web, however, is where anonymity and illegality intersect. It requires special software such as Tor to access, and much of its activity happens behind encryption and invitation-only walls. Tor, short for The Onion Router, was originally developed by the U.S. Navy for secure communication but has since become a haven for both privacy advocates and criminals.",
      "It anonymizes users by routing traffic through multiple encrypted layers, making it almost impossible to trace where a request truly came from. This anonymity allows criminals to communicate, sell data and conduct illegal trade with reduced risk of exposure.",
      "Over time, the dark web has become a hub for criminal commerce. Marketplaces once operated like eBay for illegal goods, offering everything from drugs and stolen credit card data to hacking tools and fake identities. Many of these platforms have been shut down, but the trade continues on smaller, more private channels, including encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. Vendors use aliases, ratings and escrow systems to build credibility.",
      "Ironically, even among criminals, trust is a critical part of business. Forums often have administrators, verified sellers and mediators to settle disputes. Members who cheat others or fail to deliver are quickly blacklisted, and reputation becomes the main currency that determines who can be trusted.",
      "The criminal economy and how scams are born",
      "Every major cyberattack or data leak often traces back to the dark web's underground economy. A single attack typically involves several layers of specialists. It begins with information stealers, malware designed to capture credentials, cookies and device fingerprints from infected machines. The stolen data is then bundled and sold in dark web markets by data suppliers. Each bundle, known as a log, might contain login credentials, browser sessions and even authentication tokens, often selling for less than $20.",
      "Another group of criminals, known as initial access brokers, purchases these logs to gain entry into corporate systems. With that access, they can impersonate legitimate users and bypass security measures such as multi-factor authentication by mimicking the victim's usual device or browser. Once inside, these brokers sometimes auction their access to larger criminal gangs or ransomware operators who are capable of exploiting it further.",
      "Some of these auctions are run as competitions, while others are flash sales where well-funded groups can buy access immediately without bidding. Eventually, this chain of transactions ends with a ransomware attack or an extortion demand, as attackers encrypt sensitive data or threaten to leak it publicly.",
      "Interestingly, even within these illegal spaces, scams are common. New vendors often post fake listings for stolen data or hacking tools, collect payments and disappear. Others impersonate trusted members or set up counterfeit escrow services to lure buyers.",
      "Despite all the encryption and reputation systems, no one is truly safe from fraud, not even the criminals themselves. This constant cycle of deception forces dark web communities to build internal rules, verification processes and penalties to keep their operations somewhat functional.",
      "What you can do to stay ahead of dark web-driven threats",
      "For ordinary people and businesses, understanding how these networks operate is key to preventing their effects. Many scams that appear in your inbox or on social media originate from credentials or data first stolen and sold on the dark web. That is why basic digital hygiene goes a long way. Below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "From password managers to antivirus software, experts share practical ways to keep hackers out of your data. (Annette Riedl/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "A growing number of companies specialize in removing your personal data from online databases and people search sites. These platforms often collect and publish names, addresses, phone numbers and even family details without consent, creating easy targets for scammers and identity thieves.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the easiest ways to stay safe online is to use unique, complex passwords for every account you own. Many breaches happen because people reuse the same password across multiple services. When one site is hacked, cybercriminals take those leaked credentials and try them elsewhere, a technique known as credential stuffing. A password manager eliminates this problem by generating strong, random passwords and securely storing them for you.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Antivirus software remains one of the most effective ways to detect and block malicious programs before they can steal your information. Modern antivirus solutions do far more than just scan for viruses. They monitor system behavior, detect phishing attempts and prevent infostealer malware from sending your credentials or personal data to attackers.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Outdated software is one of the biggest entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers and plugins to deliver malware or gain access to systems. Installing updates as soon as they are available is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of defense. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browsers and critical applications.",
      "Even if your password gets leaked or stolen,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional barrier for attackers. With 2FA, logging in requires both your password and a secondary verification method. This includes code from an authentication app or a hardware security key.",
      "Identity theft protection can provide early warnings if your personal information appears in data breaches or on dark web marketplaces. These services monitor your sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, bank details or email addresses. If anything suspicious is detected, they alert you. Many providers also offer recovery assistance, helping you restore stolen identities or close fraudulent accounts. While no service can prevent identity theft entirely, these tools can shorten your response time and limit potential damage if your data is compromised.",

      "Protecting your identity starts with strong passwords, two-factor authentication and regular software updates. (Jens Kalaene/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The dark web thrives on the idea that anonymity equals safety. But while criminals may feel protected, law enforcement and security researchers continue to monitor and infiltrate these spaces. Over the years, many large marketplaces have been dismantled, and hundreds of operators have been caught despite their layers of encryption. The takeaway for everyone else is that the more you understand how these underground systems function, the better prepared you are to recognize warning signs and protect yourself.",

      "LIVING IN GIANT MOON GLASS SPHERES COULD BE OUR FUTURE",
      "Starcloud aims to build the first orbital data centers, cutting emissions and speeding up global computing. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Why space data centers matter for the future",
      "Every time you send a message, store a file in the cloud or use AI, large computers on Earth handle the work. These data centers use massive amounts of electricity and water to stay cool. They also release heat, noise and greenhouse gases that affect local communities.",
      "Space offers a different environment. Solar energy is abundant, and cooling happens naturally in the cold vacuum.\u00a0\"The only environmental cost is the launch,\" said Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston.\u00a0\"After that, we could save ten times the carbon emissions compared with running data centers on Earth.\"",
      "For a world searching for greener technology, that goal matters.",
      "How the NVIDIA GPU will work in orbit",
      "The Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small refrigerator, will carry NVIDIA's H100 GPU. It is nearly one hundred times more powerful than any chip ever sent into orbit.",
      "Once in space, the GPU will process huge amounts of satellite data. It will study images of Earth to identify wildfires, track crops and monitor weather. Normally, satellites send this data back to Earth for processing, which can cause long delays. Doing the analysis in orbit allows faster results and better decisions on the ground.",
      "The mission will also test Google's Gemma language model in orbit. It will be the first time a large AI model operates in space.",

      "By processing satellite data in orbit, Starcloud hopes to make Earth monitoring faster and more efficient. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Starcloud plans to build space data centers",
      "Starcloud hopes this is only the beginning. The company plans to build larger data centers in space powered by sunlight and cooled by the natural chill of orbit. Future systems will include the next generation of NVIDIA GPUs called Blackwell, which promise even higher performance.",
      "Starcloud's long-term goal is to create a five-gigawatt orbital data center about 2.5 miles wide (around 13,000 feet across). It could handle massive AI workloads while cutting costs and carbon emissions. As launch prices continue to fall, building data centers beyond Earth could soon become practical.",
      "Johnston believes that by the 2030s, many new data centers will operate in orbit instead of on land.",
      "What this space mission means for you",
      "If this works, the technology that powers your apps, games and AI tools might soon be running in space. This change could make cloud services faster, more efficient and less harmful to the planet.",
      "Space-based data centers could also speed up disaster response, improve weather forecasts and save millions of gallons of water every year. The idea shows that innovation and sustainability can grow together.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Sending an NVIDIA GPU into orbit shows how quickly technology is changing. The mission combines curiosity, innovation and a genuine push to make computing cleaner and faster. As space becomes more reachable, the idea of data centers floating above Earth feels less like fiction and more like something that could actually happen. Each of these missions could teach us a little more about how to build a sustainable digital future.",

      "HACKERS FOUND A WAY TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER REMOTELY",
      "Start by checking whether your PC can handle Windows 11. Most modern AMD and Intel processors already meet the system requirements. Upgrading keeps your computer protected with ongoing updates that patch vulnerabilities and improve overall performance.

The evaluation came from Nauto, Inc., creator of the Visually Enhanced Risk Assessment, or VERA Score. This system uses AI to measure fleet safety on a scale of 1 to 100.",
      "The Kodiak Driver earned a remarkable score of 98. That result placed it beside the safest human fleets in Nauto's global network. The findings sparked discussion across the trucking industry and raised new questions about the role of automation in freight transport.",

      "The Kodiak Driver, an autonomous trucking system powered by AI, earned a top VERA Score of 98 in a new safety evaluation. (Kodiak)",
      "Kodiak Driver's autonomous truck safety evaluation results",
      "Kodiak's VERA Score of 98 matched the highest rating among all fleets evaluated. Fleets with Nauto's safety technology average a score of 78, while those without the technology average only 63.",
      "The Kodiak Driver achieved perfect scores of 100 in inattentive driving, high-risk driving and traffic violations. Its lowest score, 95, came in aggressive driving. The VERA Score combines over 20 vision-based AI variables into one clear safety rating.",
      "Nauto found that every 10-point increase in VERA Score cuts collision risk by about 21%. A near-perfect score like Kodiak's represents a strong improvement over typical human performance on the road.",
      "The strong results didn't come as a surprise to Kodiak's leadership. Don Burnette, founder and CEO of Kodiak, told CyberGuy: \"Achieving the top safety score among more than 1,000 commercial fleets in Nauto's Visually Enhanced Risk Assessment (VERA Score\u00ae) proprietary safety benchmark is a testament to the Kodiak's focus on safety. Safety is at the foundation of everything Kodiak builds. Our core value is \u2018safety first and always.\u2019 We believe independent safety evaluations like Nauto's help to validate what we already know: the Kodiak Driver is already among the safest drivers on American highways. They also help to establish and build public awareness around how safe our technology truly is.\"",
      "FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: TRUMP, MUSK AIM FOR DOMINANCE",
      "The growing impact of AI on truck driving safety",
      "Nauto equipped the trucks with advanced monitoring and hazard detection systems. These tools track both the driving environment and vehicle behavior in real time. Removing human factors such as distraction, fatigue and delayed reaction directly improves safety.",
      "Burnette said in a company statement that the system \"is never drowsy, never drunk, and always paying attention.\" That constant awareness allows the Kodiak Driver to operate defensively and predictably, two traits linked to safe driving.",
      "The VERA Score also gives fleets a consistent way to measure safety. Companies can now shift from reacting to crashes to preventing them.",
      "Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration data support the trend. U.S. commercial truck crashes dropped from more than 124,000 in 2024 to roughly 104,000 this year. Fewer crashes mean fewer fatalities and safer highways overall.",

      "Concerns about autonomous truck safety",
      "Not everyone is ready to hand over the wheel to artificial intelligence. Some industry experts point out that while systems like the Kodiak Driver perform well in controlled evaluations, real-world roads can still pose unpredictable challenges. Weather, human drivers and mechanical issues remain complex variables for autonomous systems to manage.",
      "Others worry about the impact on jobs. As AI takes on more driving responsibilities, professional drivers wonder what the shift will mean for employment and pay across the trucking industry.",

      "Businesses could see big gains. AI-powered safety tools help cut liability, lower costs and keep fleets running smoothly. The technology doesn't need rest breaks or reminders to stay focused, which makes every mile more efficient.",
      "Regulators are also paying attention. Verified data like this builds trust and clears the way for safer, wider use of autonomous trucks. It's proof that technology can deliver real-world safety, not just promise it.",
      "Drivers on everyday roads benefit too. Fewer crashes mean safer highways and more reliable deliveries. When trucks drive smarter, everyone shares the reward. Human drivers aren't going anywhere soon, but AI is quickly becoming their most reliable partner. It helps prevent fatigue, distraction and those risky split-second decisions that lead to trouble.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A new study in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the PRIMA brain computer interface (BCI) retinal implant helped people with advanced age-related macular degeneration regain some central vision. The device uses a tiny 2 millimeter by 2 millimeter photovoltaic implant that is only 30 micrometers thick, and thinner than a strand of hair. It sits beneath the retina and works with a special pair of smart glasses. The glasses capture images and send them as near-infrared light to the implant. The implant converts that light into small electrical signals that stimulate the optic nerve. This process mimics how healthy retinal cells normally send visual information to the brain.",
      "The study followed 38 participants, 32 of whom completed one year of follow-up. Twenty-six patients experienced measurable improvement in vision, which equals about 80% of the group. Many participants could read letters, numbers and even full pages of text again. Although the restored vision is black and white and slightly blurry, the results are remarkable for people who once believed they would never see clearly again.",

      "Why this matters for AMD treatment",
      "Age-related macular degeneration, often called AMD, is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in older adults. Until now, available treatments could only slow down vision loss. None of them could restore what had already been lost.",
      "The PRIMA implant works with smart glasses to bring central vision back to life. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "The PRIMA implant takes a different approach. It directly replaces the missing function of the retina by turning light into electrical signals. Patients can still use their natural peripheral vision while the implant restores some central vision. This combination creates a more complete visual experience.",
      "The trial showed that the surgery is generally safe. Most side effects occurred within the first two months and resolved soon after. Importantly, the implant did not reduce the patients' remaining natural peripheral vision. Researchers call this a major step toward restoring sight rather than only slowing its decline.",
      "The PRIMA implant was developed by Science Corporation, a brain-computer interface company founded by Max Hodak, who previously cofounded Neuralink. Science Corporation acquired the PRIMA technology from the French firm Pixium Vision, continuing its development toward clinical use.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "The tiny chip sits under the retina and turns light into visual signals. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or someone you love lives with late-stage AMD, this breakthrough may offer real hope. For the first time, there is a device that can restore some sight instead of only preserving what remains. You may want to talk with your ophthalmologist about upcoming trials or future approval of the PRIMA system in your area. The company behind the technology has already applied for European approval, and a process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is underway.",
      "Regaining even partial central vision can make a big difference. Reading text, recognizing faces or simply moving independently becomes possible again. This progress also shows how fast medical innovation is moving. Patients who were once told that nothing could help may soon have a chance to see again.",
      "It is also a reminder to stay informed. Treatments that were once experimental are becoming available sooner than expected. Discussing new technologies with your doctor helps you understand timing, eligibility and what kind of results you can realistically expect.",
      "This breakthrough offers new hope for people living with advanced macular degeneration. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The PRIMA retinal implant represents a shift in how scientists and doctors think about blindness caused by AMD. For decades, the focus was on slowing down the disease. Now, researchers are proving that restoration is possible. While this generation of the implant provides limited black and white vision, it gives real, functional sight to people who had none. That alone changes lives. More work remains to improve image clarity, color perception and comfort. Still, this is only the beginning. Future versions of the device and smart glasses may make vision restoration even more effective and accessible.",

Traditional passwords have long been the cornerstone of security, but they come with real challenges. Many of us reuse passwords across sites, and even strong passwords can be compromised in data breaches.",
      "Passkeys offer a safer and more convenient way to authenticate. However, they're still relatively new, and many of us are still trying to figure out how they work. For example, Peter recently reached out asking, \"How do I get a passkey from a PC desktop that doesn't have a camera or fingerprint device?\"",

The good news is that passkeys are designed to work on virtually any device, whether or not it has biometric hardware like a fingerprint reader or camera.

      "Passkeys make signing in faster and safer by replacing traditional passwords with encrypted keys. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys use cryptography to prove who you are. When you create a passkey, your device makes two keys, one public and one private. The public key goes to the website, and your private key stays on your device. During login, your device confirms your identity with the private key. The website never sees or stores it.",
      "This process blocks phishing and password theft. It also makes sign-in faster. You don't need to remember or type long passwords anymore.",
      "While passkeys simplify authentication, they don't eliminate the need for a secure password manager. Password managers can safely store and sync your passkeys, just as they do with passwords, allowing you to access your credentials across devices and browsers \u2014 even if those devices don't natively sync passkeys, such as between Windows and Apple systems. Using a password manager alongside passkeys creates a bridge between platforms and provides an additional layer of security and convenience.",
      "Can you use passkeys without biometrics?",
      "Yes, you can. A PC or Mac without a camera or fingerprint reader can still use passkeys. On Windows, you unlock them with your Windows Hello PIN. On Apple devices, you can use Touch ID, Face ID or your passcode. The key is having an updated operating system and browser that support passkeys.",
      "If you manage multiple accounts or devices, a password manager that supports passkeys can act as your central vault. This lets you use passkeys even on systems that don't directly support syncing through iCloud or Google Password Manager. It's an easy way to ensure you always have access to your credentials, no matter what kind of device you use.",
      "Why you still need passwords",
      "Not every website supports passkeys yet. Some services still rely on passwords. Keep strong, unique passwords for those accounts. Passwords also serve as backup if you lose a device or can't use your passkey. Over time, more sites will support password-free logins.",
      "This is where password managers continue to play an important role. They bridge the gap between old and new authentication methods, allowing you to store both traditional passwords and passkeys in one secure place. Until the web is fully passkey-ready, combining the two provides both convenience and resilience, giving you a seamless experience across multiple devices and services.",
      "Passkeys also prevent phishing because your private key never leaves your device during sign-in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Mad Max Mode returns in Tesla's latest FSD update",
      "Tesla recently launched its FSD v14.1.2 update. The update follows last year's major FSD v14 release, which introduced \"Sloth Mode\" for slower, more cautious driving. The latest update moves to the opposite end of the spectrum with Mad Max mode.",
      "According to Tesla's release notes, this profile allows higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than Hurry mode. The update has sparked mixed reactions. Some Tesla fans praise it for making driving feel more natural. Critics argue that it invites risky behavior at a time when regulators like the NHTSA and California DMV are already investigating Tesla's advanced driver-assist systems.",
      "TESLA'S SELF-DRIVING CARS UNDER FIRE AGAIN",
      "A new Mad Max speed profile is now included in Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving interface. (Tesla)",
      "History of Tesla's Mad Max mode since 2018",
      "The Mad Max setting isn't new. Tesla first introduced it in 2018 for the original Autopilot system. At the time, Elon Musk described it as ideal for handling aggressive city traffic. The name, borrowed from the post-apocalyptic movie series, immediately drew attention for its bold tone.",
      "Now, the feature is back in Tesla's latest FSD version. Within hours of release, drivers reported seeing cars equipped with Mad Max mode rolling stop signs and driving over the speed limit. These early reports highlight how the mode may behave more assertively than before.",
      "Why Tesla brought back its Mad Max mode",
      "Bringing back Mad Max mode may serve several purposes for Tesla. It helps demonstrate the company's continuous development of FSD software while appealing to drivers who prefer faster, more decisive movement in traffic. It also acts as a signal that Tesla is still chasing the goal of Level 4 autonomy, even though its system remains classified as Level 2, requiring constant driver supervision.",
      "Tesla owners can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles.\u00a0 (Chesnot/Getty Images)",
      "For Tesla, this feature shows confidence in its progress. For observers, it raises concerns about timing. With multiple investigations and lawsuits in progress, many expected Tesla to focus on safety rather than on more aggressive driving profiles.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you own a Tesla with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), you can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles. This mode provides a more assertive driving experience that includes quicker acceleration, more lane changes, and less hesitation.",
      "However, remember that Tesla's Full Self-Driving system still requires active driver attention. You must keep your hands on the wheel and remain ready to take control at any moment. While the name suggests thrill and speed, safety and awareness should remain your top priority.",
      "Tesla\u2019s speed-profile menu includes the toggle options of Chill, Standard, Hurry, and Mad Max profiles to customize how aggressively their car responds in traffic.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Mike Blake)",
      "If you share the road with Teslas, it's smart to stay alert. Vehicles using Mad Max mode may accelerate or change lanes more quickly than expected. Giving Teslas a little extra space can help reduce surprises and keep everyone safer on the road.",

      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",

      "Tesla's decision to reintroduce Mad Max mode is both strategic and provocative. It revives a feature from its early Autopilot days while reigniting debate over the balance between innovation and responsibility. The mode's return reminds everyone that Tesla continues to test the limits of driver-assist technology and public tolerance for it.",

Even if a scammer gets your password through a fake American Express email, they cannot access your account without your verification code. Most banks and credit card companies offer this free feature in their security settings. Enable it today and make your login stronger.",
      "Data removal services help clean up your personal information from data broker websites that collect and sell your details to advertisers, marketers and even scammers. Reducing your digital footprint limits the amount of information that phishing attackers can use to make fake emails look convincing. In the case of fake American Express messages, less personal data online means fewer details criminals can use to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Phishing emails thrive on urgency. Before clicking, take a deep breath and ask yourself: Does this message feel pressured or suspicious? Instead of clicking \"verify now,\" open a new browser tab and visit the official credit card website to check your account. This one simple pause can stop a scam in its tracks.",

      "Identity monitoring services keep watch over the dark web and alert you if your personal information, such as your email address, password, or credit card number, appears in stolen data. If scammers gain access to this information, they often use it to create realistic phishing attempts, like the fake American Express \"account restricted\" email. Early detection through identity monitoring allows you to take action, such as changing passwords, freezing credit, or alerting your bank before real damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Legitimate companies like American Express will never ask for full account numbers, passwords, or security codes by email. Familiarize yourself with how real messages from your bank look and sound. If something feels off, forward the message to the company's official fraud department and delete it immediately.",
      "If a phishing attack installs malware on your computer, it can lock or delete files. Keep secure backups on an external drive or a trusted cloud service. That way, even if scammers target your system, you will not lose access to your information.",
      "If an email feels wrong, it probably is. Your intuition is one of your strongest defenses against scams. Combine it with these habits to stay ahead of cybercriminals and keep your personal and financial information safe.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Wednesday the victims of sexual abuse by grooming gangs needed action, not another inquiry, as Opposition Leader Kemi Badenoch pressed for a national inquiry. (Video: Parliamentary Recording Unit via AP.)",
      "A Swedish appeals court\u2019s decision not to deport a convicted rapist because his assault on a 16-year-old girl was not deemed \"exceptionally grave\" has ignited outrage, fueling a backlash against Sweden\u2019s justice system.",
      "The Court of Appeal for northern Norrland confirmed to Fox News Digital that the defendant, an Eritrean national and illegal immigrant, Yezied Mohamed, was sentenced to three years in prison for raping the 16-year-old girl from the northern town of Skellefte\u00e5, on Sept. 1, 2024. The court acknowledged that while the crime was serious, it did not meet the threshold for deportation because of its nature and short duration.",
      "The ruling prompted swift condemnation from Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, who released a video promising stricter deportation laws. \"No one should have to worry about meeting their attacker or rapist on the street,\" Kristersson said. \"Those who commit serious crimes in Sweden and are not Swedish citizens must leave the country.\"",
      "In a written response to Fox News Digital, Judge Lars Viktorsson said the court considered both the nature and duration of the act, noting there was no use of weapon, and there wasn\u2019t intercourse, and that \"the duration of the incident had been short.\" \"It is true that the duration of the rape was of significance in the assessment of the matter of deportation,\" Viktorsson stated, \"However, the nature of the offense was at least as significant.\"",

We are going further than any government has ever done before.\"",
      "Migration Minister Johan Forssell echoed the prime minister's sentiment in a video he posted on X, calling the case unacceptable. \"The victim\u2019s right to safety must always outweigh the perpetrator\u2019s right to stay in Sweden,\" he said. \"Next year I will present new legislation that will make Sweden the toughest country in the Nordic region when it comes to crime-related deportations.\"",

After an appeal, the Court of Appeal overturned that ruling, concluding that Mohamed matched the description given by the victim and a witness, and that forensic evidence placed him near the scene.",
      "The court sentenced him to three years in prison, the minimum for rape in Sweden, and ordered him to pay 240,000 Swedish krona, about $25,600, in damages.

      "\u201cWe will learn a lot in just a few days\u2019 time in New Jersey and Virginia, among other elections, and what impact these results may have on the government shutdown,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the poll along with the Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.",
      "\u201cWhat we know is that this is an electorate that remains deeply unhappy with the status quo,\u201d Horwitt said.",
      "Democrats\u2019 lead on the congressional ballot is among the larger advantages they have enjoyed in any public polling in 2025. This poll was conducted Oct. 24-28, with a majority of respondents (52%) blaming Trump and congressional Republicans for the monthslong government shutdown \u2014 but historically high numbers blaming congressional Democrats, too (42%).",
      "One key question that has arisen during past government shutdowns is whether the politics of the moment persist throughout an election cycle, once a funding impasse has been resolved.",
      "Shutdowns can produce \u201cunstable\u201d moments in politics, McInturff said. \u201cAnd in our experience, they tend to fade away,\u201d he continued.",
      "A majority of voters still have negative views of the Democratic Party, and just 28% say they have positive views, essentially unchanged from a record-low rating in March. And Republicans retain strong advantages with voters on key issues including border security and crime, though Democrats have caught up on the economy.",
      "Voters, particularly Democrats, are also fired up about the next election. Asked to rate their interest in the 2026 elections on a 10-point scale, 66% of voters responded \u201c9\u201d or \u201c10\u201d \u2014 higher interest one year out than voters registered in the weeks preceding four of the five recent midterm elections.",
      "For Democrats, 74% rate their interest at \u201c9\u201d or \u201c10,\u201d while 67% of Republicans and 50% of independents say the same. That 7-point enthusiasm edge in the survey is on par with the 9-point enthusiasm edge Democrats enjoyed in the 2018 midterms.",
      "All together, it\u2019s clear Trump is shaping up to be a major factor in next year\u2019s midterm elections, with 70% saying they want their vote to send a message about support for or opposition to the president \u2014 the highest number in NBC News polling dating back nearly 30 years. A plurality of voters (40%) say they want their vote to send a signal of opposition to Trump, while 30% say they want to send a signal of support for Trump.",
      "The high election interest and focus on Trump also come as millions of Americans have participated in \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests against the Trump administration. In this survey, 43% say they consider themselves supporters of the No Kings protest movement \u2014 with the group largely composed of Democrats but also including around 4 in 10 independents.",
      "Economic warning signs",
      "Speaking on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last December, before he took office, Trump distilled his 2024 victory down to two key factors: \u201cI won on the border, and I won on groceries.\u201d",
      "The new poll numbers show some warning signs for the president on both issues, especially the economy \u2014 as well as on a top voter issue of protecting democracy and constitutional rights, too.",
      "On economic issues, sizable majorities of registered voters say Trump and his administration have fallen short of their expectations on the cost of living (66%), looking out for the middle class (65%) and the economy (63%), with approximately one-third saying he has lived up to their expectations.",
      "Majorities of independents, as well as voters across ethnicities, age groups and economic circumstances, all say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy. A chunk of Republicans also agree, concentrated among those who don\u2019t view themselves as \u201cMAGA Republicans.\u201d",
      "The October 2025 results mirror NBC News\u2019 polling in August 2010, months before midterm elections that were seen as a repudiation of President Barack Obama. At that time, two-thirds of Americans said Obama and his administration had fallen short of their expectations on the economy, as the country struggled through the aftermath of the Great Recession.",
      "Today, 61% say that their family\u2019s income is falling behind the cost of living, while 31% say it\u2019s staying even and only 6% say it\u2019s going up faster than the cost of living \u2014 about in line with NBC News polling from the last four years.",
      "How the parties handle different issues",
      "The poll also found voters essentially split on the question of whether Democrats or Republicans would do a better job handling the economy, with 38% backing Republicans and 37% backing Democrats.",
      "That\u2019s the smallest lead Republicans have had on this question in NBC News polling since December 2017, which was the last time Democrats registered an advantage. In September 2023, around the same period in the last election cycle, Republicans had a 21-point edge.",
      "Republicans posted sizable leads on three core issues: border security (a 31-point edge over Democrats), crime (+22 points) and immigration (+18 points), maintaining key advantages they\u2019ve enjoyed in recent elections.",
      "Democrats have an 8-point edge on protecting constitutional rights and an 11-point edge on protecting democracy. That\u2019s a turnaround from 2023, when Republicans had an 8-point lead on the issue of protecting constitutional rights and a 1-point edge on democracy.",
      "And Democrats\u2019 23-point lead over Republicans on handling health care is tied for their highest mark on the issue since July 2008.",
      "Divides on immigration",
      "While Trump\u2019s Republican Party enjoys significant advantages over Democrats on immigration-related issues, the president\u2019s deportation program \u2014 and his administration\u2019s tactics and use of executive power for that program and other goals \u2014 have sparked some public dissent.",
      "A narrow majority, 51%, say that Trump has lived up to expectations on border security and immigration.",
      "Yet 54% say that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cdeployment of federal agents and National Guard troops to various cities around the country to fight crime and immigration\u201d are largely not justified, while 44% said that the deployments were justified.",
      "The poll also tests voter sentiment about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, whose agents are on the front lines of the administration\u2019s deportation program. Thirty-nine percent of registered voters view ICE positively and 50% view it negatively. White voters are split in their view of ICE, while two-thirds of Black and Hispanic voters view the agency negatively.",
      "The share that feels positively about ICE is roughly in line with previous NBC News polls from 2020 and 2018. But the share with negative views has spiked, with those who view the agency \u201cvery\u201d negatively nearly doubling since 2020, from 22% then to 40% now.",
      "Constitutional rights and democracy",
      "The issues of protecting constitutional rights and democracy also show up in the poll as top concerns among voters.",
      "The survey asked respondents to rank their most important issues, offering other choices including overall cost of living, electricity and health care costs, political violence, immigration and border security and abortion.",
      "About a quarter of voters said that protecting democracy or constitutional rights was the single most important issue in deciding their congressional vote next year. But costs also loomed large, with 16% choosing cost of living, 10% choosing the cost of health care premiums and 4% choosing the cost of electricity.",
      "Another 10% said immigration and border security are their top issue, while 9% said dealing with political violence and 7% said abortion.",
      "\u201cThe fundamentals of our country and democracy, the Constitution, normally these are theoretical things that people don\u2019t think about and take for granted. And it\u2019s pretty clear that Americans are not taking them for granted these days, and that\u2019s true for whether they\u2019re Republicans, Democrats or independents,\u201d said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.",
      "Fifty-two percent of voters said Trump has done more than previous presidents to undermine the U.S. Constitution than to protect it, while 31% say he\u2019s done more to protect the Constitution.",
      "Dim views of both parties",
      "There are clear opportunities for Democrats in Trump\u2019s polling struggles. But even as they hold leads over Republicans on the congressional ballot and on some key issues, the party\u2019s overall standing hasn\u2019t improved from record lows.",
      "Just 28% of registered voters say they have a positive view of the party, compared to 27% in March, while 53% view the party negatively. The Republican Party has higher marks: 37% view it positively and 46% view it negatively.",
      "As in March, one big difference between the two parties \u2014 and one reason why the Democrats have lower marks overall \u2014 comes from how voters view their own parties.",
      "Seventy-eight percent of Republicans say they view their party positively and just 8% say they view it negatively. But for Democrats, 59% view their party positively and 22% view it negatively.",
      "Independents, meanwhile, have dim views of both parties, with less than a quarter of those voters holding positive views of either the Democratic or Republican parties.",
      "Gaza peace efforts",
      "The poll also tested views on one of Trump\u2019s major foreign policy efforts: his attempts to broker peace in Gaza, where Israel and Hamas have spent two years at war.",
      "Voters are split on Trump\u2019s handling of the war in general: 47% approve, 48% disapprove. That\u2019s a dramatic improvement from how voters judged then-President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the war, which was at 34% approval in November 2023 and 27% in April 2024.",
      "But U.S. voters are deeply skeptical that Palestinians and Israelis will be able to form a lasting peace agreement. A previous ceasefire negotiated at the end of the Biden administration fell apart earlier this year, and Israel conducted strikes in Gaza soon after the poll concluded, with Israel and Hamas trading accusations of breaking the current ceasefire.",
      "Just 21% say they think Palestinians and Israelis will form a lasting peace, while 69% say they won\u2019t \u2014 as high as that number has been in five instances of this poll question stretching back to 1993. Another 10% are unsure.",
      "When asked about whether U.S. troops should participate in any peacekeeping force in Gaza, 41% say they favor the use of those American boots on the ground while 54% disapprove.",
      "The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters Oct. 24-28 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

      "The share of registered voters with positive views of capitalism has dropped under 50% for the first time in seven years of NBC News polling on the issue \u2014 a shift that comes as some democratic socialists, like New York mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani, gain prominence in the Democratic Party.",
      "Overall, 44% of registered voters say they have a positive view of capitalism, while 28% view it negatively. That\u2019s a dip from how the economic system had been viewed in previous polls, which showed slim majorities viewing capitalism positively.",
      "There\u2019s a stark partisan difference in views on capitalism, a trend that also plays out in various demographics more likely to identify with either party. Two-thirds of Republicans view capitalism positively, compared to 44% of independents and 25% of Democrats. Just 12% of Republicans view capitalism negatively, compared to 28% of independents and 45% of Democrats.",
      "Notably, 39% of Democrats viewed capitalism positively in September 2024, while 34% viewed it negatively then \u2014 a 5-point net-positive rating, compared to a 20-point net-negative rating among Democrats now.",
      "Voters under the age of 35 also swung heavily toward more negative views of capitalism over the last year, while Hispanic voters also swung in the same direction and are now effectively split on the economic system.",
      "Meanwhile, views of socialism have stayed more stable. Now, 49% of registered voters view it negatively \u2014 a slight decline from past measurements, which bounced between 50% and 55%. And 18% view socialism positively, right in line with how voters have felt each time the question has been asked since 2018.",
      "Under the hood, the trends look similar to the movement on capitalism, just in reverse.",
      "Last September, 34% of Democrats viewed socialism positively and 29% viewed it negatively. Now, a similar 35% of Democrats view socialism positively, but 20% view it negatively.",
      "While Hispanic voters soured a bit on capitalism in the poll, their views on socialism didn\u2019t move in the same way. Hispanic voters viewed socialism negatively by a 29-point margin in 2024. Now, it\u2019s a 24-point margin.",
      "Views on capitalism and socialism, particularly among Democrats, are evolving as Mamdani and other self-described democratic socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have become increasingly powerful in their party, barnstorming the country and commanding a vocal constituency.",
      "Mamdani, having come up in politics as a democratic socialist and still leaning into that identity, could be on the precipice of winning arguably the largest office in the movement\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cI call myself a democratic socialist, in many ways inspired by the words of Dr. King from decades ago. \u2018Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism, there has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God\u2019s children in this country,\u2019\u201d Mamdani told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this summer.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s top opponent, Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York, has used that affiliation as a cudgel. Before and after Mamdani defeated him in the June Democratic primary, Cuomo has called Mamdani a socialist, not a Democrat, and warned that his policies will bankrupt the city.",
      "\u201cI am the Democrat. He is a socialist. New York cannot survive as a socialist economy,\u201d Cuomo told Fox News last week.",
      "Though Mamdani is running for a municipal post, the campaign\u2019s national prominence in the nation\u2019s largest city means that about two-thirds of registered voters nationally already feel they know enough about him to register an opinion on him.",
      "Overall, 22% of registered voters view Mamdani positively, while 32% view him negatively and 14% have a neutral view. Another 32% either aren\u2019t sure or don\u2019t know enough to rate him.",
      "Virtually every Republican who knows enough about Mamdani to rate him views him negatively, while Mamdani fares much better among Democrats: 44% view him positively and 10% view him negatively. Among independents, 16% view him positively and 25% view him negatively.",

      "Now, two weeks later, a Florida reptile hunter who calls himself the Python Cowboy says he\u2019s convinced the FBI is barking up the wrong tree.",
      "Mike Kimmel, owner of Martin County Trapping and Wildlife Rescue, told NBC News that the elevated stand has been there for years and the only mystery is whether it was set up by a hunter, birder or wildlife photographer.",
      "\u201cWhen we had first seen it, Joe Biden was president,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cAnd it looked old and dilapidated at the time. It never gave, like, a suspicious vibe.\u201d",
      "A professional trapper for over a decade, Kimmel operates across southern Florida, removing invasive species like Burmese pythons, green iguanas and feral hogs. He also guides hunting trips, with the help of his specially trained dogs \u2014 Trouble, Rooster and Rowdy, among others.",
      "The waterways surrounding the Palm Beach airport are well known to Kimmel. They are prime spots for hunting iguanas.",

      "\u201cIt never crossed our minds that it would be used by someone taking a shot at the president or anything like that,\u201d Kimmel said.",
      "In July 2024, a would-be assassin managed to fire several rounds at Trump during a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania, striking him in the ear. Two months later, the Secret Service arrested a man who was spotted hiding in the bushes with a rifle at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. A Florida jury in late September found him guilty of trying to assassinate Trump.",
      "Kimmel said the Secret Service reached out to him after the first assassination attempt and told him to refrain from going on hunts in the area for the next week or so.",
      "\u201cWe respected that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re out there with air guns and everything. It can look suspicious.\u201d",
      "If you spend as much time in that area as he does, Kimmel said, there's plenty of other things that you could see.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s homeless camps out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of trash. I found a dead body out there. The tree stand is a very small blip.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the FBI is wasting their time,\u201d he added.",
      "One of Kimmel\u2019s hunting guides, Joseph \u201cJR\u201d Entry, also recalled first seeing the stand a couple years ago and thinking little of it. He said he and the other guides find the FBI\u2019s sudden attention amusing and a bit perplexing.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a big stink about nothing, to be honest with you,\u201d Entry told NBC News.",
      "An FBI spokesperson said the agency continues to analyze the hunting stand materials for forensic clues at its laboratory in Quantico, Virginia. So far, the investigation has not identified any individuals connected to the mystery tree perch, the spokesperson added.",

      "The video clips he posts on YouTube and Instagram \u2014 showing him belly-flopping onto pythons in alligator-infested swamps and bagging serpents like a pregnant 16-footer with 60 eggs in its belly the size of grapefruits \u2014 often draw thousands of views and media attention.",
      "In 2024, he took a blind dog on a hunt with him, and the pooch, nicknamed \u201cHelen Killer,\u201d helped him snag a 9-foot python that also couldn\u2019t see. The feat was chronicled in the Miami Herald, which described him as \u201cone of Florida\u2019s best-known wildlife trackers.\u201d",

    "summary": "RFK Jr. has come out in support of saturated fats, saying he plans to encourage higher intake in future U.S. dietary guidelines. Here's what the science says about it.",
    "story": [
      "Changes may be coming to the U.S. dietary guidelines: If public comments from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are any indication, Americans could see a big difference when it comes to saturated fat.",
      "In July, Kennedy said at a meeting of the National Governors Association that new guidelines would be \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cstress the need to eat saturated fats, dairy, good meat, and fresh meat and vegetables.\u201d He has called guidelines that promote low-fat dairy over full-fat versions \u201cantiquated.\u201d He has also praised fast-food chains that have switched their fryers from vegetable oil to beef tallow. Beef tallow is 50% saturated fat.",
      "Saturated fats are known to raise the risk of heart attack, stroke and other types of cardiovascular disease. For 45 years, federal dietary guidelines have recommended Americans eat less of them.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services and the Agriculture Department update the dietary guidelines every five years; 2025\u2019s update has not been released yet. They historically rely on the recommendations of an expert advisory committee that spends two years sifting through the latest research and issues a detailed report.",
      "The current expert committee published its report nearly a year ago and endorsed the existing recommendation for saturated fat: Americans should limit saturated fat intake to less than 10% of their daily calories starting at age 2, replacing it with unsaturated fat, particularly polyunsaturated fat. It added that Americans should try to get their unsaturated fat from plant-based sources.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments suggest that the Agriculture and Health and Human Services departments may ignore the committee\u2019s advice for the 2025 dietary guidelines, said Eric Rimm, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cWe all are waiting to read it,\u201d he said.",
      "HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said in an email: \u201cSecretary Kennedy is committed to new dietary recommendations that are rooted in rigorous science. The 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans will be a big part of the Trump Administration\u2019s commitment to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "What is saturated fat?",
      "Saturated fats include butter, lard and shortening. They\u2019re typically solid at room temperature and are naturally found in beef, pork, poultry, full-fat dairy products and eggs, as well as in coconut and palm oils. They\u2019re often added to processed foods like savory snacks, desserts and prepared meals.",
      "Polyunsaturated fats, on the other hand, are typically liquid at room temperature \u2014 they tend to come in the form of oils. Canola, corn, soybean and sunflower oils are high in polyunsaturated fat. So are oily fish \u2014 like anchovies, herring, salmon, sardines and striped bass \u2014 some nuts and seeds, and soybeans and tofu.",
      "Processed foods and fats and oils account for nearly 42% of the saturated fat in the American diet. Dairy is the next largest source, at about 28%, followed by meat, at 22%.",
      "What\u2019s the evidence say about saturated fat and health?",
      "In its report last year, the dietary guidelines advisory committee reviewed randomized controlled trials, as well as observational studies that followed thousands of people for decades.",
      "\u201cThe research is pretty clear,\u201d said epidemiologist Cheryl Anderson, a committee member and the dean of the University of California San Diego Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science. Decades of data shows that eating saturated fat raises LDL cholesterol levels and contributes to cardiovascular disease, she said.",
      "Too much LDL cholesterol \u2014 the so-called bad cholesterol \u2014 can combine with fats and other substances to create a thick, hard substance called plaque that builds up in the inner walls of blood vessels, reducing blood flow.",
      "\u201cIf you obstruct blood flow to a heart, you have a heart attack. If you obstruct blood flow to the brain, you have a stroke,\u201d said Dr. Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.",
      "Some of the committee\u2019s findings with the strongest scientific evidence are:",
      "Replacing butter with plant-based oils and spreads that contain mostly unsaturated fats decreases LDL cholesterol levels.Substituting whole grains, vegetables or plant sources of protein for red meat is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.Replacing oils high in saturated fats with vegetable oils higher in unsaturated fats decreases LDL cholesterol.Substituting white meat for red meat is not associated with a difference in cardiovascular disease risk.",
      "Replacing butter with plant-based oils and spreads that contain mostly unsaturated fats decreases LDL cholesterol levels.",
      "Substituting whole grains, vegetables or plant sources of protein for red meat is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.",
      "Replacing oils high in saturated fats with vegetable oils higher in unsaturated fats decreases LDL cholesterol.",
      "Substituting white meat for red meat is not associated with a difference in cardiovascular disease risk.",
      "Research about dairy \u2014 milk, cheese and yogurt \u2014 and cardiovascular health is limited, according to the committee. Until more definitive studies are conducted, it advised the government to continue to recommend that people eat fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt and cheese.",
      "How to eat less saturated fat",
      "Reducing the consumption of foods high in saturated fat is important for both adults and children \u2014 other than infants, who need a high-fat diet for rapid growth \u2014 according to nutrition experts.",
      "\u201cYou start putting fatty deposits in the lining of your blood vessels in childhood,\u201d said Dr. Mark Corkins, chair of the committee on nutrition at the American Academy of Pediatrics and the chief of pediatric gastroenterology at Le Bonheur Children\u2019s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. \u201cWe may not see coronary artery disease until you\u2019re middle-aged or older, but that\u2019s when it starts.\u201d",
      "To reduce saturated fat intake, nutrition experts advise parents and adults to focus on foods rather than individual nutrients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s best to think about changing all of your diet, eating more fruits and vegetables, eating less processed meat, and if you\u2019re going to eat red meat, have smaller portion sizes,\u201d Rimm said.",
      "The committee recommends getting less protein from meat and more from beans, peas, lentils, nuts, seeds and soy. It also recommends using less butter and coconut and palm oils and more vegetable oils high in unsaturated fats.",
      "Olive oil contains mostly monounsaturated fats and is considered a healthy alternative to saturated fats. Vegetable oils high in polyunsaturated fats, like corn, canola and soybean, are seed oils, which have come under a recent wave of criticism, particularly on social media, including from Kennedy, who has posted on X that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by seed oils.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really baffling to scientists,\u201d said Kristina Petersen, an associate professor of nutritional science at Penn State who studies diet and risk of cardiovascular disease. The collective body of research shows that consuming seed oils is linked to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes, she said. \u201cThere is no evidence to support that they are harmful.\u201d",
      "Yancy, of Northwestern, said there are several \u201cirrefutably beneficial\u201d diets that people can follow: the Mediterranean Diet, the DASH diet and a combination of the two called the MIND diet.",
      "When the government finally publishes the latest dietary guidelines for Americans, no matter what it says, Yancy strongly encourages everyone \u201cto become much more self-aware of what a healthy lifestyle means, seek conversations with trusted health care professionals and find guidance in truth.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Derek and DeAnna Huffman were desperate to leave Humble, a suburb of Houston. Their three daughters, they believed, were being brainwashed by public school and mainstream media to support LGBTQ rights. American culture in general no longer offered white people the same opportunities as other races, they said.",
      "The couple yearned to live in a place that shared their \"Christian values\" and where they \"weren't going to be discriminated against\" as white, politically-conservative Christians.",
      "So in March, the Huffmans became the first family to move to a community planned for fellow English-speakers some 30 miles west of Moscow, a project they had been following online run by long-term American expat and former Kremlin-sponsored RT host Tim Kirby. The family is among a small but growing number of Americans who have moved to Russia because the United States, in their opinion, has become too \u201cwoke.\"",
      "The Russian government has welcomed these culture war refugees. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order offering temporary residence to people wanting to move to the country because they rejected \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of their home countries.",
      "Around 1,500 of these \u201cideological immigrants,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed by the Russian media, including 127 Americans, have applied for temporary residence in Russia, according to the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs.",
      "\"President Putin is an amazing leader and he\u2019s done great things for Russia,\u201d Derek Huffman, 45, said in a video on his family\u2019s YouTube channel on March 9. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like you see on the news.\u201d The social media platform X \u201cis the only place where you get real information\" about America's own problems, Derek says.",
      "The family initially found a community of Russians and westerners on social media who encouraged their move, with donations from some of their 15,000 YouTube subscribers providing financial support after their arrival in Russia. But when Derek Huffman voluntarily joined the Russian army in May, the family became a lightning rod for broader online scrutiny.",
      "Derek Huffman said he joined the Russian army to expedite the family\u2019s applications for Russian citizenship, as well as to show support for their new homeland.",
      "\u201cAbove and beyond the citizenship, the money, a big part of it for me is about the respect and earning our place here in Russia,\u201d he said on the Huffmans\u2019 YouTube channel on May 26.",
      "But in a follow-up video posted in June, which was subsequently deleted, DeAnna Huffman, 42, told viewers that her husband had been \u201cthrown to the wolves.\u201d NBC News viewed a re-upload of the video.",
      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",
      "Pro-Ukrainian commentators, keen to publicize hardship for pro-Russian figures, said on social media that Derek Huffman had been killed. A post on X claiming to have access to drone footage of his death has more than 2 million views. NBC News did not find video to substantiate the claim, and DeAnna Huffman denied the reports.",
      "Derek reappeared in several videos on the family\u2019s YouTube channel uploaded on October 25, celebrating his daughter\u2019s birthday and signing forms to receive his Russian passport.",
      "In one filmed in the family\u2019s neighborhood, he said he was back \u201con vacation\u201d after being deployed for six months, and praised his wife for keeping the family going while he was gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m still alive and doing what I can to survive, and be of service to Russia. I\u2019m so thankful to all the Russian people who have reached out and helped my family while I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Another family, the Hares, also moved from Abilene, Texas, to Russia to shield their three sons from what they say are harmful elements of American culture.",
      "\u201cIt was the promise of a country that would not promote the LGBT agenda. We liked the fact that LGBT is basically outlawed here in official ways,\u201d Leo Hare, 62, told NBC News via a video call from the family\u2019s new home in Ivanovo, Russia.",
      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",
      "The Hares have endured their share of hardship trying to build a new life in Russia.",
      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",
      "Leo Hare thought their troubles were over when their landlord\u2019s son offered a generous interest rate for investing their $50,000 nest egg in what he described as a car import business. But they only saw one payment before he stopped sending them money and refused to return their money, Leo Hare said.",
      "The couple went to the police and the local court to file complaints about their lost money and with their concerns that they had been swindled, but say they have received no help from law enforcement officials. NBC News contacted Domodedovo police for comment but did not receive a reply.",
      "The Hares\u2019 sons, 17, 15, and 12, have had difficulty adapting to life in Russia, and the two older boys want to return to America, according to their father. They feel isolated and are disappointed that school is not an option since Russia requires students to pass a language test to study in public schools.",
      "Leo and Chantelle, who ran a carpet cleaning business and a mobile snack business back in the U.S., are now working as English tutors. They have found an apartment in Ivanovo, northeast of Moscow, and \u201care living really comfortably now.\u201d They are currently homeschooling their children. Leo Hare said it probably \u201cwould have been a dealbreaker\u201d if they knew about the school restrictions.",
      "The Hares have not met the Huffmans.",
      "Leo Hare says he never considered joining the army because of his age and safety concerns, and says that Derek Huffman \u201cassumed a little too much\u201d about life in the Russian military.",
      "\"We assumed a lot, too,\" he admitted. \"But we do have a faith in Christ and He is leading us, even though we\u2019ve made mistakes.\""

    "summary": "On \"Sunday Sitdown,\" Judd Apatow recalled his early days as a comedian and explained how \"Anchorman\" got made when it was being turned down by a popular studio.",
    "story": [
      "Judd Apatow says that if it wasn't for one iconic director, then \"Anchorman\" probably wouldn't be what it is today.",
      "The legendary comedian explained how it happened on the Nov. 2 episode of \u201cSunday Sitdown.\" He said the first draft of \"Anchorman,\" written by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, told an entirely different story.",
      "He said the plot was about a group of anchorpeople who survive a plane crash on their way to an anchor convention.",
      "\"So they crash into a mountain, and it becomes about them trying to survive, and slowly they wonder if they need to eat each other,\" he laughed. \"And they brought me in at some point and they wrote a new script, which was what became 'Anchorman.'\"",
      "Once they started pitching the new script, Apatow said some people had their doubts about whether Ferrell could play the lead.",
      "It wasn't until Steven Spielberg stepped in that Ferrell was able to secure his role as legendary anchor Ron Burgundy.",
      "At the time, Ferrell was getting a lot of attention for his role as Frank in \"Old School.\" Apatow recalled the comedic frat movie and said it was \"hysterical.\"",
      "\"But DreamWorks had just put us in turnaround, which means they weren\u2019t going to make it,\" he said of \"Anchorman.\"",
      "\"And then one day in a meeting, Steven Spielberg said, 'Old School\u2019s a big hit. What else do we have with Will Ferrell? We should do something else with him.' And they were like, 'Well, we just put it in turnaround.' And he\u2019s like, 'Well, get it back,'\" Apatow said.",
      "Thanks to that decision, \"Anchorman\" was put in production, and in 2004, it hit theaters.",
      "\u201c(Spielberg) was the reason Adam and Will were allowed to make 'Anchorman,\u2019\u201d Apatow said.",
      "Along with Ferrell, the movie featured then-rising comedians like Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Christina Applegate and Steve Carell.",
      "Apatow said Carell specifically always had the movie's staff in tears.",
      "\"If you were on the set of 'Anchorman,' and you were just watching the shoot, there was no one there who wasn\u2019t like, 'Steve Carell is the funniest guy ever,'\" he said.",
      "\"So just one day I\u2019m like, 'Do you have any ideas for yourself as a lead?' And then one day he told me about a sketch he worked on once about a guy who is at a poker game, and they were all talking dirty about sex, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s lying and hasn\u2019t had sex. And I thought, 'Sadly, I understand that,'\" Apatow laughed. \"I know how to develop that.\"",
      "That movie turned into Carell's breakout film \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\"",
      "When asked what advice he would give to people who are trying to get into comedy, Apatow turns to his new book, \"Comedy Nerd: A Lifelong Obsession in Stories and Pictures.\"",
      "\"Part of how I built the book is that I put all the failures in there also. So all the pilots that weren\u2019t picked up, everything that was a bomb. And I talk about how that happened. How did things fall apart? What\u2019s it like when they work? What\u2019s it like when they don\u2019t work?\" he said.",
      "\"So you have to really be strong, and find your voice, and not give up,\" he added. \"I always say, if you give up, it\u2019s not going to work. So, the key is not quitting.\""

      "There was the \"baecation\" with his fellow runner-up Olandria Carthen, then more recently, a Miami trip alongside Season 6's Rob Rausch and Kendall Washington. In between, he's been training for his next big move: running the New York City Marathon on Nov. 2.",
      "\"Ironically, this week has been the busiest week since leaving the villa,\" Nic tells TODAY.com. \"I have a marathon to train for, so of course the week of is going to be the busiest.\"",
      "Nic, who will be running the marathon with Team Strava, says he decided to run the race just a few months ago, \"which I know is a bit later in the training process,\" he admits with a laugh. The registered nurse already has two marathons under his belt \u2014 one of which was part of an Ironman race.",
      "\"Hopefully it won't be too hard,\" he says of the NYC race.",
      "Even if it is, Nic says he'll have plenty of support. Fans can track his race via the New York Road Runners app, and \"hopefully meet me every mile of the way,\" he says.",

After sharing a kiss in the first episode, they each moved on into different couplings, until fate \u2014 or more accurately Casa Amor \u2014\u00a0intervened.",
      "Both Nic and Olandria were dumped from the show during Casa, but a getaway car twist whisked them away to a date, where they were given the option to return to the villa if they coupled up. They chose to give a romance a try with the Soul Ties kiss heard 'round the world, much to the joy of their devoted legion of \"Nicolandria\" fans who say they saw their chemistry on Day 1.",

      "Just over a week before the marathon, Nic was in Miami for a launch party hosted by Celsius. There, he met up with Rob and Kendall from the show's breakout Season 6. Because they have shared \"lore,\" as Nic puts it, they didn't end up talking much about what happened during their time in \"Love Island\" villa.",
      "\"I asked Rob specifically how he's been navigating the life afterwards,\" Nic says. \"I think asking people from the last cast is so beneficial, because they've literally gone through the same thing.\"",
      "His biggest insight?",
      "\"The thing that I noticed was that Rob and Kendall just seem to be the same people they were online. And so I think the biggest takeaway is just being who you are, and if people can't accept that, then they're not your cup of tea,\" he says.",
      "When it came to balancing marathon prep with all his opportunities, Nic says finding the time to run helped quiet all the \"noise.\"",
      "\"They don't go hand in hand,\" he says of his busy schedule and training. \"But after doing the events at night it's nice to wake up early in the morning and get the run done. It's definitely a way to clear the mind.\"",

      "\"I think at this point we're looking for just a breath of a fresh air from all the hectic-ness,\" he says.",
      "\"I've said this before, like I want to go on our hot air balloon date, I want to do all these things \u2014\u00a0but at this point, I'm like, I just want to sit on a couch and do nothing with her,\" he adds. \"That sounds elite.\""

Not as a costume, but as a statement,\" she said. \"When her husband was assassinated, she refused to change out of her blood-stained clothes, saying, \u2018I want them to see what they\u2019ve done.\u2019 The image of the delicate pink suit splattered with blood is one of the most haunting juxtapositions in modern history.\"",
      "\"Beauty and horror. Poise and devastation. Her decision not to change clothes, even after being encouraged to, was an act of extraordinary bravery,\" Fox continued. \"It was performance, protest, and mourning all at once. A woman weaponizing image and grace to expose brutality. It\u2019s about trauma, power, and how femininity itself is a form of resistance. Long live Jackie O \u2665\ufe0f.\"",

      "According to The New York Times, Jackie Kennedy, who died in 1994, refused to change out of her blood-stained suit after her husband's assassination on Nov. 22, 1963. She kept the outfit on when Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's vice president, was sworn in as head of state later that day.",
      "The National Archives has kept the pink suit preserved in a climate-controlled vault outside of Washington, per The New York Times.",
      "The suit won't be available for public viewing until the year 2103 as to not \"dishonor the memory of Mrs. Kennedy or President Kennedy, or cause any grief or suffering to members of their family,\" according to a deed of the suit from when it was gifted to the National Archives."

Thank you for the present.\u2019\u201d",
      "Collaborations with Eladio Carri\u00f3n, Beto Montenegro, Young Miko and Justin Quiles, as well as dreamy angelic music videos for each track, only enhanced her vision.",
      "Below, Elena Rose breaks down \u201cBendito Verano,\u201d the inspiration for her opening song \u201cMantra,\u201d her upcoming tour and more.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "I think after (my 2024 song) \u201cMe Lo Merezco\u201d (\u201cI Deserve It\u201d) was born, I was like, \u201cThis is where I\u2019m feeling the best,\u201d because it transcended the music and it became more about the message and what it was doing in people\u2019s lives.",
      "It was that feeling of, \u201cLook at everything we\u2019ve gone through and we made it. We\u2019re here at the beach, let\u2019s just have fun and dance.\u201d Mixing that feeling of what summer means to me and then asking the question of, \u201cIf there were to be a summer in heaven, what playlist would they play?\u201d",
      "Which is why we have sax, we have trumpets because I would picture angels performing in heaven. (I wanted this album) to help us remember the things that really matter ... and it would be about love.",
      "We have elements like Afro that make me feel freedom, that make me feel at peace, joy and be in the present. There\u2019s a lot of roots feelings when I listen to a bass line, or when I listen to the drums that remind me that I come from amazing people that have done amazing things in order for me to be here.",
      "But then I have my message, which is where I really come in and put like my little grain of salt. I speak about mental health and awareness and emotional responsibility and real and unconditional love.",
      "We went to Italy to record all the visuals. Every song has a visual. The first time I went to Italy, it was right after I picked up my relationship with my father. We hadn\u2019t spoken in like five years and my father is half Chilean, half Italian, but grew up in Venezuela.",
      "My last name is Italian, and I had always wanted to go to Italy, and I\u2019m grateful it happened right after we hugged it out. Visually, the woman that I saw in Italy was a woman hugging everything about where she comes from and who she is. (Someone) who never lost her essence, but really worked on the woman that she wants to be and who she wants to be for the world and her industry and her craft. I\u2019m grateful to see that visually. I needed to see it. And in a place like Italy, in Lake Como, the first thing that I thought was, \"If God wakes up in the morning and opens the window of his bedroom, this is the view.\"",
      "And then we recorded everything in Italy, aesthetically with this woman that you see vulnerability and innocence, but then you also see her strength and her resilience.",
      "The album opens up with a mantra that I wrote with my life coach that repeats, \"I am, I am.\" It\u2019s just one minute. I want people to start the days like that. It's how I start my days.",
      "The interlude was my best friend. I asked him, \u201cIf you could describe the warrior of light, how would you describe her?\u201d",
      "And then it closes with a song that I wrote to my inner child. It begins with my mom and my grandmother singing. So it\u2019s very, very intentional, just a big ball of love.",
      "I think every song has something like \u201cLuna de Miel\u201d (with Rawayana), to me, is the wedding song of the album. \u201cLa de Dios\u201d is the moment to connect with the purest part of your heart, your inner child, and also to connect with God. It\u2019s a reminder in a world that right now is in a lot of chaos.",
      "\u201cAleluya!\u201d tells you, love without fear. \u201cAlma\u201d tells you, look at everything that you\u2019ve gone through. You\u2019ve always had everything and if you lose whatever you have, you\u2019re losing nothing.",
      "\u201cAm\u00e9n Beb\u00e9,\u201d you have a partner and you build something together, a best friend, a boyfriend, a dog, celebrate life. There\u2019s a little bit of everything. I\u2019m just grateful that I have an album that I think you can listen from beginning to end, and it\u2019s gonna be an experience.",
      "I\u2019m excited, happy. This is my first US tour. We\u2019re going to be presenting the album. We\u2019re preparing a very intimate show, which is how I like it. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s gonna be way too long and people are gonna tell me, \u201cYou guys have to leave.\u201d And we\u2019re all gonna be like, \u201cNo!\u201d",
      "I\u2019m excited to see my warriors of light. They\u2019re everything to me. We feed each other and we exchange energy. We elevate each other, and I\u2019m bringing now a work that I put all my heart and soul (into), and I can\u2019t wait for you guys to listen to it."

Many of the guests of the party are writers and intellectuals who George hopes to impress in order to get the  position. George's main competitor for the job is Eileen Lovborg (Nina Hoss), a female scholar who studies and writes about sexual pleasure, and is also Hedda's former lover.",

When she is able to get Eileen alone, Hedda confesses that she is still in love with Eileen. Eileen says that she wants to move on with Tabitha, and explains the importance of her new manuscript, which encompasses her life's work.",

      "\"Eilert becoming Eileen was really about wanting to have another woman in the story, another foil to Hedda,\" DaCosta tells TODAY.com. \u201cI really wanted to explore another way that a woman could attempt to find agency and to attain power.\"",

      "How does \u2018Hedda\u2019 end?",

      "Hedda attempts to hide the weapon when she encounters Judge Brack, her friend and former love interest. Brack blocks her and forces himself onto her, before Hedda escapes and begins to run outside. Brack catches up to Hedda and pushes her onto the ground, restraining her in a chokehold. Suddenly, they hear voices coming from towards the house.",
      "Brack releases Hedda and runs off into the trees. Hedda gets up and walks towards the lake, where she fills her pockets with several large rocks and other heavy objects. Hedda begins to walk into the lake, her full pockets weighing her down.",

    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Derek and DeAnna Huffman were desperate to leave Humble, a suburb of Houston. Their three daughters, they believed, were being brainwashed by public school and mainstream media to support LGBTQ rights. American culture in general no longer offered white people the same opportunities as other races, they said.",
      "The couple yearned to live in a place that shared their \"Christian values\" and where they \"weren't going to be discriminated against\" as white, politically-conservative Christians.",
      "So in March, the Huffmans became the first family to move to a community planned for fellow English-speakers some 30 miles west of Moscow, a project they had been following online run by long-term American expat and former Kremlin-sponsored RT host Tim Kirby. The family is among a small but growing number of Americans who have moved to Russia because the United States, in their opinion, has become too \u201cwoke.\"",
      "The Russian government has welcomed these culture war refugees. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order offering temporary residence to people wanting to move to the country because they rejected \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of their home countries.",
      "Around 1,500 of these \u201cideological immigrants,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed by the Russian media, including 127 Americans, have applied for temporary residence in Russia, according to the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs.",
      "\"President Putin is an amazing leader and he\u2019s done great things for Russia,\u201d Derek Huffman, 45, said in a video on his family\u2019s YouTube channel on March 9. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like you see on the news.\u201d The social media platform X \u201cis the only place where you get real information\" about America's own problems, Derek says.",
      "The family initially found a community of Russians and westerners on social media who encouraged their move, with donations from some of their 15,000 YouTube subscribers providing financial support after their arrival in Russia. But when Derek Huffman voluntarily joined the Russian army in May, the family became a lightning rod for broader online scrutiny.",
      "Derek Huffman said he joined the Russian army to expedite the family\u2019s applications for Russian citizenship, as well as to show support for their new homeland.",
      "\u201cAbove and beyond the citizenship, the money, a big part of it for me is about the respect and earning our place here in Russia,\u201d he said on the Huffmans\u2019 YouTube channel on May 26.",
      "But in a follow-up video posted in June, which was subsequently deleted, DeAnna Huffman, 42, told viewers that her husband had been \u201cthrown to the wolves.\u201d NBC News viewed a re-upload of the video.",
      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",
      "Pro-Ukrainian commentators, keen to publicize hardship for pro-Russian figures, said on social media that Derek Huffman had been killed. A post on X claiming to have access to drone footage of his death has more than 2 million views. NBC News did not find video to substantiate the claim, and DeAnna Huffman denied the reports.",
      "Derek reappeared in several videos on the family\u2019s YouTube channel uploaded on October 25, celebrating his daughter\u2019s birthday and signing forms to receive his Russian passport.",
      "In one filmed in the family\u2019s neighborhood, he said he was back \u201con vacation\u201d after being deployed for six months, and praised his wife for keeping the family going while he was gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m still alive and doing what I can to survive, and be of service to Russia. I\u2019m so thankful to all the Russian people who have reached out and helped my family while I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Another family, the Hares, also moved from Abilene, Texas, to Russia to shield their three sons from what they say are harmful elements of American culture.",
      "\u201cIt was the promise of a country that would not promote the LGBT agenda. We liked the fact that LGBT is basically outlawed here in official ways,\u201d Leo Hare, 62, told NBC News via a video call from the family\u2019s new home in Ivanovo, Russia.",
      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",
      "The Hares have endured their share of hardship trying to build a new life in Russia.",
      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",
      "Leo Hare thought their troubles were over when their landlord\u2019s son offered a generous interest rate for investing their $50,000 nest egg in what he described as a car import business. But they only saw one payment before he stopped sending them money and refused to return their money, Leo Hare said.",
      "The couple went to the police and the local court to file complaints about their lost money and with their concerns that they had been swindled, but say they have received no help from law enforcement officials. NBC News contacted Domodedovo police for comment but did not receive a reply.",
      "The Hares\u2019 sons, 17, 15, and 12, have had difficulty adapting to life in Russia, and the two older boys want to return to America, according to their father. They feel isolated and are disappointed that school is not an option since Russia requires students to pass a language test to study in public schools.",
      "Leo and Chantelle, who ran a carpet cleaning business and a mobile snack business back in the U.S., are now working as English tutors. They have found an apartment in Ivanovo, northeast of Moscow, and \u201care living really comfortably now.\u201d They are currently homeschooling their children. Leo Hare said it probably \u201cwould have been a dealbreaker\u201d if they knew about the school restrictions.",
      "The Hares have not met the Huffmans.",
      "Leo Hare says he never considered joining the army because of his age and safety concerns, and says that Derek Huffman \u201cassumed a little too much\u201d about life in the Russian military.",
      "\"We assumed a lot, too,\" he admitted. \"But we do have a faith in Christ and He is leading us, even though we\u2019ve made mistakes.\""

    "story": [
      "GIZA, Egypt \u2014 They\u2019re the crown jewels of the Grand Egyptian Museum \u2014 two galleries devoted to the ancient pharaoh Tutankhamun.",
      "Showcasing more than 5,300 objects from the young king\u2019s tomb, including his iconic death mask and glittering royal regalia, the new section of the vast museum here on the outskirts of Cairo is expected to draw millions of visitors every year.",
      "The galleries, displaying mostly pieces never seen by the public, were officially opened in an elaborate and long-awaited grand opening ceremony on Saturday in front of delegates from more than 70 countries.",
      "On a behind-the-scenes visit to the museum\u2019s Conservation Center earlier this month, general director Hussein Kamal told NBC News that it will be the first time since Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered over a century ago that all the items are stored in one place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said, adding that he was particularly excited by the exhibition featuring King Tut\u2019s armor. The piece made from textiles and leather was \u201cunique throughout ancient Egyptian civilization,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamal said the items, previously held in a storeroom, were painstakingly restored since 2017 by some of the center\u2019s 150 conservators.",
      "\u201cWe tried to reshape it from the original,\u201d he said, adding that it was a challenge because they did not have anything to compare it to and had to depend on \u201cinvestigation and analysis to know the original structure of the armor.\u201d",
      "Believed to have become pharaoh when he was 8 or 9 years old, in around 1334 B.C., Tutankhamun ruled until his death 10 years later. He is believed to have suffered from numerous illnesses and disabilities, including circulatory problems, malaria, bone disease and a club foot.",
      "Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings by the British archaeologist Howard Carter, undisturbed by grave robbers and almost completely intact, nearly 400 miles south of Egypt\u2019s most famous archeological treasures in Giza.",
      "Now the artifacts recovered from that tomb will sit in the largest museum in the world dedicated to a single civilization \u2014 the Grand Egyptian Museum's grounds cover 117 acres, or the equivalent of 80 football fields, just over a mile north of the Great Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo.",
      "The collection also includes the 4,000-year-old funerary boat, also known as the Cheops ship, of Pharaoh Khufu.",
      "At Saturday's grand opening, attended by a number of European and Arab leaders, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sought to give the event an international scale, calling on attendees to \"make this museum a platform for dialogue, a destination for knowledge, a forum for humanity, and a beacon for all who love life and believe in the value of humankind.\"",
      "With the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx as their backdrop, actors dressed in ancient Egyptian garb paid tribute to thousands of years of history, as an orchestra played fanfares. Hundreds of drones created a light show in the sky, depicting figures including Tutankhamun and ancient Egyptian gods Isis and Osiris.",
      "While the museum will officially open Tuesday, limited tours have been available since 2023, and the public is allowed access to most of its main galleries since October.",
      "Hassan Allam, CEO of the museum's management company, said daily visitor numbers would surge from 6,000 to 15,000 this week as the doors are opened on the \"out of this world\" Tutankhamun Gallery.",
      "He said running the museum had been a \"challenging and yet wonderful experience,\" describing it as a \"great privilege\" to \"play a small role in Egypt's history, maintaining it, managing it, and hosting Egyptology lovers from across the world.\"",
      "Alongside the Tutankhamun exhibition, the museum holds artifacts from the prehistoric era, dating from 700,000 B.C., to the Roman era of the fourth century A.D., arranged around themes of kingship, society and beliefs.",
      "Statues, sarcophagi and stelae also offer a glimpse into the life of Egypt\u2019s ancient elite and how they prepared themselves for the afterlife.",
      "At the museum\u2019s center sits the six-story Grand Staircase with a view of the pyramids and an atrium containing monuments, pharaonic statues and sarcophagi.",
      "The opening ceremony marks the culmination of a project first announced in 1992. Construction officially began in 2005 and has been hit by repeated delays due to the Arab Spring in the early 2010s and the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Ahmed Ezz, the chairman of Ezz Steel, which provided all of the steel rebar needed for the project, said in an interview this week that the museum not only reflects his country\u2019s past but is \u201calso part of an architectural renaissance of Egypt.\u201d",
      "After a \u201cdifficult decade,\u201d Ezz said he hoped the museum would show that his country was \u201cgoing on a more positive trajectory.\u201d"

      "Inside each ampule is the substance at the heart of the geopolitical strife between the United States and China: fentanyl, the deadly opioid at the center of a deal outlined by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping on Thursday.",
      "NBC News got exclusive access to the headquarters of Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical, the largest producer of the drug in China, and indeed Asia, at its sprawling complex in the central city of Yichang.",
      "Humanwell says that it only supplies fentanyl for use in hospitals and that it does not export any medication to the United States, Mexico or Canada. In 51 years of operating, \u201cwe have never had a single incident of a drug going missing \u2014 not a single dose has ever been lost,\u201d its president, Du Wentao, said in an interview inside his factory, which is surrounded by high fences wrapped in concertina wire and electric sensors.",
      "Humanwell is one of only five companies in China licensed to produce fentanyl for use in hospitals, and it makes around 100 million doses of fentanyl variants each year.",
      "After a strict registration process to get past the main gate, all visitors and staff alike \u2014 including the CEO \u2014 are required to wear blue hospital caps, shoe covers and lab coats to ensure they do not contaminate the workspace.",
      "Most of the production line is automated to limit human contact, with the vials being washed and sterilized and then filled with fentanyl using long rubber tubes.",
      "Two staffers in protective gear supervised the process, with an alarm pinging every 10 minutes to remind them to spray their gloved hands with disinfectant. The vials are then inspected using flashes of light, stamped, boxed up and shipped out via a warehouse.",
      "Trump pressed Xi for a crackdown on fentanyl at a meeting in South Korea on Thursday, the last stop of his three-country Asian tour. The president said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "American officials say the Chinese government hasn\u2019t done enough to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl, which are then processed into the highly addictive opioid in Mexican labs and smuggled across the border to the United States. Though deaths appear to be declining in the U.S., fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "China has previously defended its anti-fentanyl efforts and says unrelenting American demand for the drug is to blame for the crisis.",
      "But a State Department report to Congress last month accused the ruling Chinese Communist Party of continuing to \u201csubsidize and otherwise incentivize China-based companies to export synthetic drug precursors, including through tax rebates, monetary grants and awards, and official site visits.\u201d It accused companies controlled by the Communist Party of being \u201ccomplicit in this illicit trade.\u201d",
      "Under pressure from Trump, China made fentanyl a controlled substance in 2019, banning its use outside of medical prescriptions. That slowed the influx of Chinese fentanyl into the U.S., but the \u201cprolific export of chemical precursors and other illicit narcotics remains,\u201d the State Department report said.",
      "Chinese officials rejected that narrative. \u201cChina expresses sympathy for the American people suffering from the fentanyl crisis,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "But he added that \u201cChina is the country most resolute in drug control, with the most comprehensive policies and the best track record. It is also one of the countries with the largest number of controlled substances and the strictest regulations in the world.\u201d",
      "Du, the president of Humanwell Healthcare, which produces 100 million doses annually of fentanyl-based products, says that the meticulously clean, automated and controlled operation observed by NBC News was no facade.",
      "\u201cThe management of fentanyl drugs in China is among the strictest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is absolutely no possibility that any dose from our company has flowed to the United States. I can state this with full confidence and certainty \u2014 there is no issue whatsoever.\u201d",
      "He derided the \"many statements in the U.S. claiming that the fentanyl crisis originates from China,\" saying that is impossible \"given how strict our controls are.\"",
      "As well as the visit to Humanwell, NBC News gained exclusive access to the National Narcotics Intelligence Center in Beijing, which had been sanctioned by Washington in 2020 but saw those measures lifted three years later during the Biden administration as the two countries agreed to resume cooperation on fentanyl.",
      "There, Chinese security officials said the two sides are again exchanging information on how smugglers alter their tactics.",
      "Fentanyl precursors are \"indeed one of our main concerns because drug synthesis techniques and methods are constantly evolving,\" lab director Hua Zhendong told NBC News.",
      "\"We have not found such processing plants domestically,\" he said, so \"most of the relevant information comes from technical exchanges with U.S. counterparts.\"",
      "Hua said the latest precursor chemicals identified by the U.S. \u201care added to our monitoring list so we can strengthen our attention to these substances.\"",
      "He said that banning all fentanyl products outside medical use in 2019 had \"effectively curbed illegal production and trafficking.\"",
      "U.S. officials say that's not the case. As Washington and Beijing seek common ground on the issue, experts say halting the illicit flow of fentanyl components is easier said than done.",
      "\u201cI think there is an assumption here that if the Chinese really wanted to shut off these precursors, they could do it,\u201d said Michael Swaine, a senior research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based think tank, speaking ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "The problem, he said, is that there is no \u201cset number\u201d of precursors to fentanyl.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a clear list of specific items that you would be able to easily interdict,\u201d Swaine said. \u201cAnd a lot of them, of course, are very dual-use items.\u201d",
      "So while there might be a \u201csymbolic effort\u201d to deal with the fentanyl issue after the Trump-Xi meeting, he said, \u201cI don't think that this is going to go completely away.\u201d"

    "summary": "Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall in Jamaica and Cuba this week, followed what has become a familiar pattern for major storms as the climate changes.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall in both Jamaica and Cuba in the last two days, followed what has unfortunately become a familiar pattern for major storms in a warming world.",
      "The most catastrophic storms \u2014 those with the most intense winds and soaking rains \u2014 were once rare, but they are becoming more likely because of climate change. And similarities are emerging among these powerful hurricanes\u2019 behavior and timing, too.",
      "Before Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 monster, it churned over especially warm waters \u2014 as did other hurricanes over the past decade. This allowed it to strengthen at blistering pace, becoming the most powerful of this year\u2019s Atlantic season and tying the record for strongest landfall ever in the Atlantic.",
      "Then the storm slowed to a crawl, giving it more time to dump rain on Jamaica, another hallmark of hurricanes on a warming planet. Melissa\u2019s timing, too, was notable: It formed late in the season \u2014 hurricane activity has typically been thought to peak in early September \u2014 as ocean heat lingered into the fall.",
      "Taken together, this behavior makes Melissa a kind of poster child for the new normal of hurricanes, experts said.",
      "\u201cThese storms aren\u2019t the same storms as a couple decades ago,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at the nonprofit research group Climate Central.",
      "It\u2019s a shift with life-or-death consequences \u2014 one that forecasters and officials in storm-prone areas are now watching closely.",
      "Intensifying in a hurry",
      "One of Melissa\u2019s most eye-opening characteristics is how remarkably fast it intensified. In just 18 hours, it exploded from a tropical storm into a Category 4 Sunday, before reaching Category 5 strength early Monday.",
      "Climate change is increasing the risk of this \u201crapid intensification\u201d pattern, which the National Hurricane Center defines as an increase in sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph over 24 hours.",
      "In Melissa\u2019s case, Winkley said, unusually warm sea-surface temperatures in the Caribbean and high levels of moisture in the atmosphere caused an \u201cextreme rapid intensification.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at forecasting and understanding when hurricanes are going to make a big boost in intensity, but with Melissa, it even exceeded the best forecast that we can make for it in terms of wind speed,\u201d he said.",
      "Winkley added that the storm passed over Caribbean waters that were 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual \u2014 conditions that climate change made up to 700 times more likely.",
      "Two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit may not sound like a lot when it comes to a giant hurricane, but small temperature differences can really make a big impact,\u201d Winkley said.",
      "Many other recent storms have undergone rapid intensification. Last year, Hurricane Milton\u2019s wind speed increased by 90 mph in roughly 25 hours, and in 2022 Hurricane Ian went through two rounds of rapid intensification before making landfall in Florida. The list goes on: Hurricanes Idalia in 2023, Ida in 2021 and Harvey in 2017 all underwent rapid intensification, too.",
      "Fewer hurricanes, higher impact",
      "In the past 35 years, the number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones that form annually has been decreasing.",
      "\u201cWe find that the number of hurricanes globally, including typhoons, has gone down significantly since 1990,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist who studies hurricanes at Colorado State University.",
      "But that overall decrease is largely due to a drop in cyclone activity in the Pacific, Klotzbach said; Atlantic hurricane activity has risen, primarily as a result of a decades-long trend toward La Ni\u00f1a, a seasonal circulation pattern that tends to weaken the high-altitude winds that discourage hurricane formation.",
      "\u201cLa Ni\u00f1a is good for the Atlantic if you like hurricanes,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "When hurricanes do develop, they\u2019re more likely to turn into major storms as the seas warm.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase of those reaching Category 4 and 5,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "Melissa was the third Category 5 hurricane this year \u2014 the first time in two decades that more than two storms of such power have formed in the same season.",
      "Zachary Handlos, an atmospheric scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that although warmer seas in the future will be more conducive to hurricanes, a warmer atmosphere will force changes to the high-altitude winds that can prevent or destroy hurricanes. These winds could strengthen in some locations and weaken in others, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very straightforward answer.\u201d",
      "How these trends will play out remains an active area of research and scientific dispute.",
      "A longer hurricane season",
      "It\u2019s not lost on experts that the strongest hurricane of the season hit just days before Halloween.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty late into the season at this point. Things should be starting to wind down,\u201d said Derrick Herndon, a researcher in the Tropical Cyclone Research Group at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "The Caribbean has always been a hotspot for powerful, late-season hurricanes, but they\u2019re becoming even more likely, Klotzbach said \u2014 he recently submitted research showing the trend for peer review. At the same time, hurricane data in the era of satellite observations (from 1971 to 2022) suggests that hurricane season is beginning earlier in the year, too.",
      "The fall hurricane pattern has been fueled by the long-term trend toward the La Ni\u00f1a pattern, Klotzbach added, which itself is likely the result of a combination of climate change and natural variability.",
      "La Ni\u00f1a weakens high-altitude winds at a time when Caribbean waters are still hot, setting the stage for storms in late October and early November, he said: \u201cIt loads the dice toward these robust hurricanes.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Melissa was exacerbated by warmer-than-usual waters off Jamaica\u2019s southern coast.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a really intense hurricane in the Atlantic, it\u2019s going to probably be in this part of the world,\u201d Herndon said.",
      "In the past, such a storm would typically have churned up cold water from below the surface and stifled its own growth, according to Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist with the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. But this year, ocean heat is elevated both at the surface and as deep as 200 feet below, he said, so Melissa simply churned up more heat and energy.",
      "Storms are stalling",
      "Just before or after landfall, hurricanes are now more likely to stall and dump immense amounts of rain, according to a study published last year. Other research suggests their forward speed has gotten slower overall, though this remains a topic of debate.",
      "Hurricane Melissa followed the pattern, stalling off the coast of Jamaica as it continued to build intensity. On Tuesday morning, the day of its first landfall, the storm was moving at just around 2 mph. Forecasters expected up to 30 inches of rainfall in parts of Jamaica, which is more than a third of its annual average.",
      "Scientists have not reached a consensus about why some storms are moving more slowly, but some have theorized that it\u2019s because climate change has weakened atmospheric circulation patterns.",
      "Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was a dramatic example of the consequences of such stalling: When it parked over Houston, the storm dropped about 5 feet of rain in some locations. The pattern is particularly problematic because a warmer atmosphere can absorb and deliver more rainfall.",
      "\u201cFor every 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming, the atmosphere can hold onto 4% more moisture,\u201d Winkley said. \u201cWarmer oceans not only boost the intensity of hurricanes, but it allows for more evaporation, so it\u2019s putting more of that rain-making moisture into the atmosphere for these hurricanes to absorb and then unleash.\""

      "Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests.",
      "In a study conducted among healthy adults, people who accumulated most of their daily steps in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had significantly lower risks of heart disease and death nearly a decade later than those who got in several shorter walks throughout the day. The study was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",
      "What\u2019s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.",
      "An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the UK Biobank. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.",
      "Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group \u2014 42.9% of participants \u2014 fell into the under-five-minute category.",
      "After about 9\u00bd years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.",
      "People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.",
      "Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations \u201cdoses.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear dose response,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cThe longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.\u201d",
      "The decision to study people\u2019s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to total number of steps or intensity of physical activity, was intentional, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cEveryone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.\u201d",
      "Forget \u2018exercise snacks\u2019 and 10,000 steps a day",
      "The notion that adults should strive for 10,000 steps a day is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, a professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&M University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode \u2014 changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn\u2019t see as strong health gains, he said.",
      "\u201cYou need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that\u2019s where the health benefits come from,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThe one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.\u201d",
      "Despite mixed research on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be \u201csuboptimally active.\u201d All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.",
      "The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.",
      "\u201cYou have big returns from zero to something,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThen you keep getting benefits, but they\u2019re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you\u2019re not accumulating too many more benefits.\u201d",
      "The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of \u201cexercise snacks,\u201d or spurts of physical activity lasting less than five minutes. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz\u2019s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.",
      "\u201cEvery step counts,\u201d according to the American Heart Association, a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.",
      "\u201cGetting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there\u2019s definitely a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, you\u2019re just not optimizing the benefits.\u201d",
      "\u2018Never too late\u2019 to start walking",
      "The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.",
      "Another research constraint is that participants\u2019 walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people\u2019s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study\u2019s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "One of the study\u2019s biggest strengths, she said, is participants\u2019 average age: 62. It\u2019s a time of life when people may assume they\u2019re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.",
      "\u201cYou can start [walking] at any age; it\u2019s not too late,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThe physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.\u201d",
      "Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it\u2019s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven\u2019t done it for so long,\u201d said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. \u201cThere has to be motivation.\u201d",
      "With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.",
      "\u201cWalking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good form of exercise.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Oct. 28, 2025, 11:12 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Steven Riechman's title. He is professor, not an associate professor."

      "President Donald Trump is touting an international force to help bring peace to the shattered Gaza Strip and see that all deceased hostages held by Hamas are returned to Israel.",
      "Trump\u2019s 20-point plan specifies that the United States would work with Arab and other \u201cinternational partners\u201d to secure areas Israeli forces have withdrawn from. \u201cThis force will be the long-term internal security solution,\u201d the plan adds.",
      "But what\u2019s known as the International Stabilization Force (ISF) is far from a reality, and so far it lacks a detailed mission, confirmed participants and sources of funding. So as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire frays \u2014 Israel carried out airstrikes in Gaza on Tuesday after, it said, Hamas fighters attacked its forces \u2014 several experts questioned its viability in interviews with NBC News.",
      "A key question is who would provide the soldiers required for the force.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re able to take care of it \u2014 very substantial nations,\u201d President Donald Trump said about the force and its future participants aboard Air Force One on Saturday. \u201cAnd we have Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, the three, and then you have many behind them. ... If you look, Turkey\u2019s involved. Indonesia is involved. Jordan, Egypt.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s, everybody\u2019s on board,\u201d he added.",
      "But only two countries have publicly said they would be willing to participate \u2014 Turkey and Indonesia. All the other countries Trump mentioned have remained silent, explicitly refused or made their participation conditional.",
      "Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah has said his country\u2019s troops wouldn\u2019t operate inside Gaza.",
      "Although Turkey has stated its willingness to commit forces, it has also said there needs to be a defined mission before it proceeds. And Israel has ruled out Ankara\u2019s involvement. (Turkey is an outspoken supporter of the Palestinians and a vocal critic of the war in Gaza.)",
      "The stakes could hardly be higher: Without stability, the Israeli military could resume its assault on the enclave \u2014 where nearly 70,000 Palestinians and hundreds of Israeli soldiers have already been killed \u2014 and Hamas could continue rearming and asserting its control over the shattered territory.",
      "Daniel B. Shapiro, who was the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2011 to 2017, said that as an idea, the ISF was essential.",
      "It was \u201ccritical to have a transition security force,\u201d he told NBC News last week. \u201cOtherwise, there would be a complete vacuum.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio also stressed its importance last week during a trip to Israel.",
      "\u201cThere is no plan B,\u201d he said.",
      "While the Trump administration has repeatedly ruled out sending American soldiers into Gaza, Rubio said \u201ca lot of countries have expressed interest\u201d in joining the force, including Indonesia and Azerbaijan.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019d want to know what\u2019s the mandate, what\u2019s the mission, what are the rules of engagement, what is this force supposed to do,\u201d he said, adding that Israelis would be \u201cin this force.\u201d",
      "NBC News has reached out to embassies of the countries Trump and Rubio most recently mentioned as possible participants \u2014 Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Azerbaijan \u2014 and none replied to questions about the ISF.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto did say in a speech at the United Nations in September that his country was ready to deploy troops to Gaza.",
      "According to Rubio, one complication is that many of the countries that have said they are willing to send troops, money or both would require a United Nations resolution or an international agreement to authorize their involvement. Israel has long been deeply critical of the role the U.N. plays in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, accusing it of bias and of perpetuating the conflict by maintaining Palestinians in a permanent refugee status.",
      "Hamas, which hasn\u2019t commented on the ISF plans, is also a wild card.",
      "Even in the \u201cbest case scenario,\u201d it would most likely take months to establish any kind of international stabilization force in the enclave, especially if Hamas doesn\u2019t agree to lay down its weapons, said Shapiro, who is a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank, pointing to a key stipulation of Trump\u2019s plan and a long-standing demand from Israel.",
      "Natan Sachs, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cIf a security force was charged with disarming [Hamas] and dislodging them as the Trump plan detailed, there is no question to my mind that they would resist that and resist that with force.\u201d",
      "As well as the makeup and number of troops, it isn\u2019t clear how the force would be funded, although Matthew Duss, the executive vice president of the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank, said he thought \u201cthe presumption is that the Arab states, the Saudis, others would be paying for this.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs much as it\u2019s being talked about, there\u2019s very little in the way of details that have been worked out yet,\u201d said Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.",
      "Although he was \u201cvery skeptical\u201d about the plan, Duss said an international, U.N.-backed force \u201cbrought stability\u201d in the Balkans after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.",
      "But at a regional level, he said, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) hadn\u2019t \u201cworked as well.\u201d Tasked with keeping the peace between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group, which, like Hamas, is funded by Iran, UNIFIL peacekeepers have on many occasions been caught in the crossfire or come under attack themselves.",
      "\u201cYou need a force there that is just going to create some measure of law and order,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that the Gaza Strip has been utterly devastated, this is an enormous task \u2014 even the most committed and efficient military would have trouble in this scenario. We saw how the United States struggled in occupying Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d"

      "\u201cHe was very nice \u2014 he apologized for what they did with the commercial because it was a very false commercial,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The ad, which Ford ran on TV during the World Series, used genuine but rearranged lines from a speech Reagan gave in 1987 while president.",
      "The ad starts with Reagan saying, \u201cWhen someone says, \u2018Let\u2019s impose tariffs on foreign imports,\u2019 it looks like they\u2019re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs, and sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer,\u201d he continues in the ad. \u201cThen the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.\u201d",
      "Reagan was a staunch free trade advocate. The purpose of the speech was to explain why \u2014 despite his strong dislike of tariffs \u2014 he had imposed retaliatory import duties on certain Japanese products."

      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor: No longer a prince, but is he no longer a threat to the British monarchy?",
      "King Charles III's move to banish his brother was largely welcomed Friday by the British media, politicians and royal observers as a necessary, if overdue, intervention.",
      "It\u2019s the fourth attempt by Buckingham Palace to shield itself from the scandal over Andrew's ties to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and the king will be hoping it is the last.",
      "Andrew, who just two weeks ago announced he would relinquish the use of his Duke of York title, has now been formally stripped of it and all his other royal titles, and effectively evicted from the 30-room mansion where he has lived for more than 20 years. It marks a dramatic culmination of a saga that has proved so damaging for the institution as it navigates waning popularity, family feuds and health crises.",
      "\"The king realized that it wasn't enough for him to just say that he would no longer use his title Duke of York, but more action had to be taken,\" NBC News royal contributor Emily Nash said. \"He understood that this was really getting to a point where it was doing very serious damage to the royal family.\"",
      "Nash pointed to just how rare a step Charles has taken \u2014 the last prince to be stripped of his title was punished for fighting for  Germany in World War 1.",
      "Andrew first stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after his disastrous BBC interview in which he cited an inability to sweat that he said contradicted allegations against him, and in 2022, Queen Elizabeth II stripped him of his royal and military patronages.",
      "The move two weeks ago appeared designed to head off fallout from a renewed wave of revelations. But instead they appeared to open the floodgates.",
      "The token rent of \"one peppercorn\u201d that Andrew has reportedly paid on his sprawling Royal Lodge home since funding its renovation two decades ago drew outrage not just from the press, but also in Parliament, as the scandal threatened to break long-standing norms that helped shield the monarchy from public scrutiny.",
      "On Monday, Charles was heckled by a protester who shouted about whether he had \u201casked the police to cover up\u201d for his brother, and how long he had known about Andrew and Epstein.",
      "Then came the statement from Buckingham Palace. \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" it read.",
      "The measures taken by the king received approving coverage Friday in much of the tabloid media, and were welcomed \"warmly\" by a government minister, as well as the leaders of the opposition Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties.",
      "\u201cThe monarchy can see that the PR war has been lost until now, and to win it, they need to show distaste for what Andrew has done and show solidarity with the victims,\u201d said royal historian Andrew Lownie, author of a recent biography of Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.",
      "Lownie said he believed there may even be grounds for a criminal investigation.",
      "The publication of late Epstein survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, which added new detail to her allegations that Andrew had sex with her on at least three occasions, had intensified the pressure on the royals.",
      "Giuffre, with whom Andrew settled a suit in 2022 for an undisclosed amount after she accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 years old, committed suicide in April. Andrew has repeatedly denied having met her and previously denied that a photograph of the two of them is real.",
      "In his statement two weeks ago, Andrew cited \u201cthe continued accusations about me\u201d as a distraction. \u201cAs I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\u201d he said.",
      "Charles' expression of solidarity with Epstein's victims, \"stood in total contrast,\" to this, said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London, and specializes in the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\"That difference speaks volumes,\" he said. \"This is the most drastic move the king could have made.\"",
      "Charles\u2019 order comes with immediate effect and Andrew will be forced to leave Royal Lodge as soon as is practicable. He will move to a property on the royal family\u2019s private estate 140 miles away in Sandringham, though it is understood that Ferguson will not be joining him.",
      "Buckingham Palace said the king\u2019s decision was made with the support of the wider family, including his son and heir, Prince William \u2014 who is widely viewed as supporting a firmer stance on Andrew as he looks ahead to his own reign.",
      "But not everyone is satisfied by Andrew being cast out from the royal family.",
      "\"Being told that you have to live in your own house and being called by your name is not a punishment,\" said Graham Smith, the chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group, Republic.",
      "Smith called for a proper investigation into Andrew's ties with Epstein and the role the rest of the family may have played in the scandal.",
      "He added that Republic was pursuing a private prosecution, which could culminate in the public prosecutor taking over the case if there's deemed to be enough merit.",
      "Lownie said Charles may have decided to kick Andrew out now because, \u201cthey\u2019re worried new revelations might come out about his relationship with Epstein.\u201d",
      "But, he added, \u201cThe king has done what he can.\u201d"

      "\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor,\" the palace said, an escalation from measures announced two weeks ago, when it said that Andrew would stop using some of his titles, including the Duke of York.",

      "The palace also said that a formal notice had been served for Andrew to leave his home at the Royal Lodge, close to Windsor Castle.",
      "It comes after revelations that Andrew was paying a rent of \"one peppercorn (if demanded) per annum\" on the 30-room mansion owned by the Crown Estate, despite having stepped back from public duties six years ago. The arrangement was revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request by The Times newspaper last week.",
      "The palace said: \"His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.\"",
      "Andrew will move to a property on the royal family's private Sandringham estate, and his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, will retain their titles, according to the palace.",

      "Legal documents published by The Times, not verified by NBC News, indicated that Andrew paid 1 million pounds for the lease when he moved into the property in 2004, also paying 7.5 million pounds for refurbishment works. The palace and Andrew did not previously comment on the reports.",

      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, wrote that she had sex with the prince on three occasions, including an \u201corgy\u201d involving \u201ceight other young girls\u201d who \u201cappeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d",

He has repeatedly denied having met her and previously denied that a photograph of the two of them is real.",
      "\"Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage,\" Giuffre's family said in a statement Thursday after the statement from Buckingham Palace was released. \"Virginia Roberts Giuffre, our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her.

      "On his three-country tour of Asia, President Donald Trump received a warm welcome from foreign leaders and showcased a diplomatic style rooted in personal rapport and dealmaking, culminating in the trade truce he reached Thursday with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "Trump appeared to relish his reception from leaders of Asian allies and partners who sought every possible opportunity to flatter and delight him even as their countries are reeling from the impact of his tariffs and other policies.",
      "Putting his arms literally and figuratively around Japan\u2019s newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Trump in Tokyo promised a \u201cnew golden age\u201d of U.S.-Japan relations and accepted a gift of cherry blossom trees and a putter that belonged to his friend, the late former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.",
      "Takaichi was the second Asian leader on this trip to say she would nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize he so highly covets, after Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, whose ceasefire agreement with Thailand was brokered in part by Trump.",
      "In Gyeongju, Trump received a large golden crown, a replica of the crown of the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla, from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. Trump and Lee were pictured in a gift shop at the Gyeongju National Museum, where items on display included a red \u201cUSA\u201d hat, Trump-branded sneakers and a shirt bearing the president\u2019s mug shot.",
      "A fighter jet escort and traditional dancers greeted Trump as he arrived Sunday in Malaysia, the first stop on his trip. After joining Trump in his motorcade, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim cracked a joke about a shared commonality, a reminder of some of the challenges faced by the American president before his election last November.",
      "\u201cI was in prison, but you almost got there,\u201d Ibrahim quipped.",
      "Even Xi, before sitting down with Trump in South Korea for their first meeting since Trump returned to office, told the president that China\u2019s development \u201cgoes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again.\u201d",
      "Trump said the meeting with Xi, which lasted about an hour and 40 minutes, was \u201camazing,\u201d rating it a \u201c12\u201d on a scale of zero to 10.",
      "The warm embrace of Trump during the trip marked a contrast to the months of tense negotiations that preceded it. The administration had pushed ahead with a series of punishing tariffs as part of a broader effort to reset trade relationships.",
      "Rates for key U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, now at 15%, are below those imposed on other countries but still high by historical standards, and have greatly strained ties.",
      "\u201cThe agreement that was signed between the Japanese government and the American government on tariffs is so unbelievably one-sided,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus. \u201cAnd the American side has sort of been trumpeting that fact.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, a South Korean mayor flew to Washington to protest Trump\u2019s tariffs outside the White House, saying 50% levies on steel in particular were pushing his steelmaking hub of Pohang to the brink of collapse.",
      "Pohang is only about 30 minutes from Gyeongju, where Trump met with South Korean officials Wednesday to finalize a trade deal with the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. Trump said that a trade deal had been \u201cpretty much finalized,\u201d the details of which were later confirmed by a senior South Korean official.",
      "The U.S.-South Korea trade deal comes less than two months after more than 300 South Korean workers were escorted in chains from a Hyundai plant in Georgia during a raid by U.S. immigration officials, a shocking sight that humiliated Koreans.",
      "The image aired continuously on news programs in South Korea, which only weeks earlier had pledged $350 billion in U.S. investment. The workers later returned home without charges to cheers and protests, and a conciliatory message from Trump, who said he wanted foreign companies \u201cto bring their people of expertise\u201d into the country and didn\u2019t want to \u201cfrighten off\u201d investment.",
      "Leaders this week signaled that they were ready to move past the friction. Takaichi signed framework agreements with the U.S. to secure a supply of rare earths and on nuclear power reactors, and even told Trump that she is considering a purchase of Ford F-150s for government work even though they are widely considered too big for Japanese streets. Trump responded by offering her \u201canything you want.\u201d",
      "Addressing business executives in Gyeongju, Trump reflected on the differences between corporate dealmaking and heads-of-state diplomacy. He said he never believed in the idea of a win-win deal, but has since learned to search for balance.",
      "\u201cIt really is a little bit different than you\u2019re doing a business deal, and you want to just rip their hearts out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut when you have nations, it\u2019s a little bit different. You\u2019ve got to all balance out a little bit.\u201d",
      "The president, who has long touted his negotiating acumen from the business world, spent the week emphasizing stronger partnerships and better balance in U.S. trade relationships.",
      "He said after meeting with Xi that he was lowering fentanyl-related tariffs to 10% from 20% in exchange for greater efforts by China to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.

      "Trump \u201cseems to have an affinity for President Xi, and I think that he seems to think of Xi not as an avatar of imperial ambition, but rather as the head of an impressive rival business company,\u201d said Ali Wyne, an adviser on U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group.",
      "Trump mused over how fast it had all come together.",
      "\u201cCan you believe it? One year ago, I was campaigning to win. Can you imagine that?\u201d Trump said in South Korea this week. \u201cHere I am president. We\u2019ve done so many different things, economically, militarily, peace-wise. You know \u2014 peace through strength.\u201d"

      "Trump said he was lowering fentanyl tariffs on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately. He said that would bring the total effective tariff rate on Chinese imports to 47% from 57%.",
      "Trump said he trusts Xi will \u201cwork very hard\u201d to stop the illicit flow of fentanyl precursors, the chemicals used to make the deadly opioid, from China to other countries. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a big difference,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. officials say China has not done enough to stop the illegal export of the precursor ingredients, which are processed into fentanyl in Mexican labs and then smuggled into the United States.",
      "China has rejected the accusations, calling its anti-fentanyl efforts the \u201cmost relentless\u201d in the world.",
      "Rare earth materials",
      "A key issue in U.S.-China trade negotiations has been rare earth materials, which are crucial for making magnets that go in everything from turbines to electric vehicles.",
      "China, which has a near-monopoly on the global supply, rattled automakers around the world when it imposed strict export controls on the materials, saying it was trying to snuff out their military use, and it has since used them as a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks.",
      "Trump said Xi had agreed to a one-year reprieve on the curbs that is likely to be \u201croutinely extended.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of the rare earth has been settled, and that\u2019s for the world,\u201d he said. A White House official standing alongside him said Trump and Xi had come to \u201can understanding\u201d and that China is \u201cnot going to impose the rare earth controls that they proposed.\u201d",
      "Analysts say even though the United States is pushing to reduce its reliance on China for the materials \u2014 with Trump signing critical minerals agreements with Thailand, Malaysia and Japan on this trip \u2014 it will be a while before that happens.",
      "\u201cBuilding new mines and, especially, expanding processing capacity \u2014 which is the real bottleneck \u2014 requires years of sustained effort and substantial investment,\u201d Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish National China Centre at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, told NBC News.",
      "Soybeans",
      "Trump said China, which resumed purchases of U.S. soybeans ahead of the meeting after having boycotted them for months, would purchase \u201clarge, tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said China would buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from the United States between now and January as part of an agreement to purchase 25 million metric tons annually for three years.",
      "The halt in purchases from China, the biggest market for U.S. soybeans, has been a major pain point for American farmers, who have been pressing the Trump administration to resolve the issue.",
      "China had not purchased any U.S. soybeans since May, sourcing instead from South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil.",
      "\"Our great soybean farmers, who the Chinese used as political pawns, that\u2019s off the table, and they should prosper in the years to come,\u201d Bessent said in an interview on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria.\u201d",
      "Ukraine",
      "Trump has long vowed to broker an end to the war in Ukraine, but after having faced resistance from Russia, he has turned to the Kremlin\u2019s close partners for help: India and China.",
      "The United States and China will \u201cwork together\u201d on ending the war between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said, adding, \u201cUkraine came up very strongly; we talked about it for a long time.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both going to work together to see if we can get something done,\u201d he said.",
      "Taiwan and Nvidia",
      "Asked about Taiwan, Trump told reporters that he and Xi didn\u2019t talk about the Beijing-claimed island democracy during their meeting. \u201cTaiwan never came up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not discussed, actually.\u201d",
      "When it came to the American artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, which on Wednesday became the first company to be worth $5 trillion, Trump said there was no discussion as to whether the United States would further relax its export curbs to allow the export of Nvidia\u2019s latest chips, called Blackwell.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about Blackwell chips,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The United States allows limited exports of the older H20 GPU chips, which are a modified version specially designed for the Chinese market.",
      "TikTok",
      "Trump did not address the proposed TikTok deal between the United States and China after the meeting, but it appears China approved it during Trump\u2019s Asia trip.",
      "Under a U.S. law that was passed last year based on national security concerns, the popular Chinese-owned app must sell its U.S. operations to a U.S. owner.",
      "Earlier in the week, Bessent said a TikTok deal might be finalized during the meeting between Trump and Xi. After the meeting, Bessent told Fox Business Network that China had approved a deal during talks in Kuala Lumpur and that other finalizations for the deal would occur over the next weeks and months.",
      "After the meeting, the spokesperson for China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the country agreed \u201cto work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\u201d according to a translation."

      "GYEONGJU, South Korea \u2014 President Donald Trump said Thursday after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he was lowering tariffs in exchange for a crackdown on fentanyl and that he would visit China in April.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way back to Washington, Trump said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "He said his meeting with Xi was \u201camazing,\u201d rating it a \u201c12\u201d on a scale of one to 10, and said that with few major obstacles remaining, a sweeping trade deal would soon be ready.",
      "Trump said he would visit China in April, and that Xi would visit the United States \u201csome time after that,\u201d either at Mar-a-Lago or in Washington.",
      "Xi told Trump that the U.S. and China should maintain \u201ccommunication at all levels\u201d to avoid a \u201cvicious cycle of retaliation.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrade should remain the ballast and propeller of China-U.S. relations, not a stumbling block or source of conflict,\u201d Xi said according to a readout released by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "The meeting in South Korea between the two leaders, their first since Trump returned to the White House, lasted about an hour and 40 minutes and was the climax of Trump\u2019s three-country Asia tour.",
      "Some issues were not addressed at all, Trump said, including the status of Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, some White House aides had worried that Trump might shift long-standing U.S. policy on the island in exchange for concessions from China, NBC News reported earlier this week.",
      "Before the meeting, Trump called Xi a longtime friend and \u201ctough negotiator.\u201d His Chinese counterpart acknowledged \u201cfrictions\u201d between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, saying that \u201cgiven our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye.\u201d",
      "Other tariffs remain, a White House official said.",
      "Earlier in the week, Bessent said a TikTok deal may be finalized during the meeting between Trump and Xi. Trump didn't mention a deal on the popular Chinese-owned app, whose U.S. operations are required to be sold to a U.S. owner under a law that was passed last year based on national security concerns. But Bessent told Fox Business Network after the meeting that China had approved a deal during talks in Kuala Lumpur, and that other finalizations for the deal would occur over the next weeks and months.",
      "After the meeting, the spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the country agreed \u201cto work with the US to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\u201d according to a translation.",
      "Both Trump and Xi wanted the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, a person familiar with the planning said beforehand.",
      "Still, Trump is continuing a long-standing practice of meeting with allies before Beijing, which former Assistant Secretary of State Dave Stilwell said indicates that the U.S. is not going to trade its alliance commitments for a deal with China.",
      "During Trump\u2019s five-day trip to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, he signed agreements with all three countries, as well as Thailand and Cambodia; made new foreign investment announcements; and proclaimed that tariff leverage can drive warring parties to stand down.",
      "Reflecting on his approach, Trump said going against the grain can sometimes deliver results.",
      "\u201cOftentimes you\u2019ll go the opposite way of almost everybody, and you\u2019ll be the one that\u2019s right, and the others will be the one that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said in Gyeongju, South Korea, offering a peek into his thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s where you have your greatest successes.\u201d",
      "Miles Yu, a former State Department adviser on China, said the U.S. and Beijing are \u201csizing each other out\u201d with trade now a key battleground issue. Washington is pushing for concrete steps on fentanyl, market access and more, he said, while China \u201cstonewalls and foot-drags\u201d and offers only broad \u201cframeworks.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the root cause of the five rounds of futile negotiations so far with China without a breakthrough,\u201d Yu said, adding that the administration is trying to shift China\u2019s approach by rallying its neighbors, a strategy that he said \u201cmay or may not work.\u201d",
      "After talks with Chinese counterparts in Malaysia last weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said negotiators had shaped a framework for Trump and Xi to consider that spanned tariffs, trade, fentanyl, rare earths and \u201csubstantial\u201d purchases of U.S. agricultural products.",
      "He credited Trump\u2019s threat of an additional 100% tariff with creating leverage and said he believed that the framework would avoid that outcome and open space for tackling other issues.",
      "Xi said Thursday that the framework agreed to in Malaysia had \u201cprovided the necessary conditions for our meeting today.\u201d",
      "Dan Caldwell, a former senior adviser to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said Trump deserved credit for pursuing a pragmatic China policy that maintained what he said was strategic ambiguity while taking steps to restore important military capabilities to deter Chinese aggression.",
      "\u201cA lot of folks wanted to assume that he was going to be reflexively hawkish on China,\u201d Caldwell said of Trump. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201d",
      "But Caldwell cautioned against expecting a breakthrough in Busan. \u201cI don\u2019t think the overall push hinges on one meeting,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cIdeally, these go well, but the whole thing does not hinge on just one set of talks.\u201d",
      "In other words, the goal was to make enough progress to get to the next date between the two leaders.",
      "Analysts in the region, too, saw limited room for a sweeping agreement this week.",
      "\u201cSome sort of consensus and agreements are very possible,\u201d said Zeng Jinghan, a professor of international relations at the City University of Hong Kong, given that both sides want \u201ca little bit of de-escalation.\u201d",
      "But Trump and Xi were unlikely to reach a comprehensive deal that settles the long-term structural differences between their countries, he said.",
      "The hope instead is for \u201cless aggressive\u201d rhetoric, Zeng said, with both Beijing and Washington likely to come back and declare the meeting a success."

      "Five new suspects have been arrested in connection with the Louvre heist in Paris, officials said Thursday, though the jewels themselves remain missing.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau gave the update to the French radio station RTL. She said that the arrests were made Wednesday in a series of police operations in Paris and surrounding areas.",
      "Beccuau did not provide details on their identities but said that one had been tracked using DNA from the scene, leading authorities to suspect that they were part of the four-person team of thieves that carried out the stunning heist.",
      "\u201cThe searches that were conducted during the night didn\u2019t allow us to find the loot,\u201d Beccuau added.",
      "Two others suspected of breaking into the Galerie D\u2019Apollon, both former delivery drivers, have \u201cpartially confessed\u201d to their roles in the crime, Beccuau said a day earlier.",
      "They include an Algerian national, 34, who was unemployed at the time of his arrest but had previously worked as a delivery driver. The second suspect, 39, is a taxi driver and a former delivery driver.",
      "One was arrested trying to board an aircraft to Algeria on Saturday night with a one-way ticket. Both were known to the police for past offenses, Beccuau said.",
      "Paris was rocked by the daylight theft 11 days ago, in which the thieves used a furniture elevator to break into the Louvre, the world\u2019s most famous museum, and steal jewels worth an estimated $102 million that were once worn by French royalty.",
      "French authorities have acknowledged major gaps in the Louvre\u2019s security, with unions blaming staff cuts and funding shortfalls."

      "POHANG, South Korea \u2014 As President Donald Trump makes his whirlwind trip through Asia, the warning from the mayor of South Korea\u2019s steelmaking hub is dire.",
      "\u201cIf tariffs keep continuing like this,\u201d Lee Kang-deok told NBC News in an interview Tuesday, \u201cthe industry in our city will collapse. And it\u2019s going to have a domino effect.\u201d",
      "South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-biggest economy, has been trying to finalize a U.S. trade agreement to lower the tariff on its goods to 15%, down from 25%.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that a trade deal had been \u201cpretty much finalized\u201d with South Korea, while South Korean presidential aide Kim Yong-beom said the two governments had \u201creached an agreement on the detailed terms of the tariff negotiations,\u201d which include a South Korean pledge to invest $350 billion in the U.S.",
      "But Trump\u2019s separate 50% levy on all steel products has devastated Pohang, a port city of about half a million people on the southeastern coast of South Korea.",
      "Much like Pittsburgh, it\u2019s synonymous with the steel industry in the country. Steel plants dot the shoreline. Its beaches are in their shadows.",
      "The Pohang Iron and Steel Co. \u2014 which eventually became POSCO \u2014 is one of the largest steel companies in the world, producing more than 37 million tons of crude steel in 2024.",
      "\u201cSouth Korea and the United States have been good friends for a long time,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut this makes us feel that this friendship is transactional.\u201d",
      "Lee \u2014 who\u2019s been mayor for 11 years \u2014 said he would like Trump to come visit Pohang, which is just a 30-minute drive from Gyeongju, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit will be held and where Trump addressed a CEOs luncheon Wednesday.",
      "Earlier this year, Lee flew halfway across the world to Washington to protest Trump\u2019s tariffs outside the White House with other Pohang representatives. They held English-language signs that said, among other things, \u201cPlease stop imposing steel tariffs on your ally Republic of Korea,\u201d referring to South Korea\u2019s formal name.",
      "Lee said in a Facebook post after his protest that Pohang was \u201cstruggling to the point of dying\u201d and that if the steel industry collapsed, so would construction, automobiles, shipbuilding and energy.",
      "He said he felt he was advocating not just for his city, but for the global steel industry and the many indirect jobs it supports.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t do as much as we\u2019d hoped in Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we sent a strong message to the entire world.\u201d",
      "As the tariffs loom large, the South Korean government is bracing for the long-term impacts and has declared Pohang an \u201cIndustrial Crisis Response Area,\u201d which qualifies the city for more subsidies.",
      "\u201cThe whole economic system will be ruined,\u201d Lee said in the interview, adding that while he thinks the U.S. is doing this mainly because of competition with China, the tariffs are hurting longtime allies such as South Korea and Japan.",

      "Israel said Wednesday that the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip was back on after it carried out intense strikes across the Palestinian enclave that killed 100 people, including children, according to local health officials.",
      "The Israeli military said it had \"begun the renewed enforcement\" of the fragile ceasefire after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered \u201cpowerful\u201d strikes on the territory as Israel and Hamas traded accusations of ceasefire violations.",
      "Dozens of targets were struck in the attack, it said, the most serious threat yet to the truce partly brokered by President Donald Trump.",

      "An official from the Israel Defense Forces told NBC News that the command to carry out the strikes was a result of Hamas allegedly attacking soldiers in the southern Gaza area of Rafah in an Israeli-controlled area. NBC News could not independently verify the claim.",
      "The IDF announced that an Israeli reservist soldier identified as Master Sgt. (Reserve) Yona Efraim Feldbaum had been killed in Rafah. Hanan Greenwood, a spokesperson for the Binyamin regional council, told NBC News on Wednesday that Feldbaum, 37, held an American passport.",

Since then, Israeli forces have killed nearly 70,000 people in Gaza, according to local health officials, and devastated the enclave, leaving a vast majority of the population with inadequate access to food, shelter and medical care. Famine was declared in parts of Gaza in August.",
