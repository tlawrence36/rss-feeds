      "Jeff Ross, the comedian known for hosting brutal roasts of celebrities, is coming to Broadway this summer with a one-man autobiographical show that will offer fans a softer side",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeff Ross, a comedian known for hosting brutal roasts of celebrities, is coming to Broadway this summer with a one-man autobiographical show that will offer fans a softer, more intimate side.",
      "\u201cThe hard part for me is letting go of a bit of my armor \u2014 of my roastmaster persona \u2014 and letting the audience get to me so that I can then get them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press ahead of a formal announcement Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy to change it up and surprise people.\u201d",
      "\u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d will play the Nederlander Theatre starting Aug. 5 for an eight-week engagement through Sept. 29.",
      "The show will explore Ross' close relatives, especially his grandfather on his mother's side \u2014 Ross calls him \u201cthe hero of my childhood\u201d \u2014 who stepped up after the comedian's parents died when he was a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very autobiographical, but it\u2019s also not really about just me. It\u2019s about all of us. When I talk about my uncle or my mom, I want you to see your uncle and your mom in the stories. That\u2019s really important to me,\u201d Ross says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very joyful. It kind of takes the stigma out of loss and sickness and lets people know that they\u2019re going to be OK no matter what happens.\u201d",
      "The title comes from the days when Ross was living with his grandfather in New Jersey. The younger man would take his grandfather to doctor visits or visit him in the hospital during the day and at night go into New York for open-mic nights.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather would always give me money for the bus and a banana, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Take a banana for the ride.\u2019 I reluctantly took it, and more often than not, I\u2019d be stuck in traffic, or I\u2019d get low blood sugar, and that banana would be a lifesaver,\u201d says Ross.",
      "\u201cBut it was really his way of saying, \u2018Be ready for anything\u2019 and also, \u2018I can\u2019t go with you but I\u2019m there with you in spirit.\u2019 So it was an emotional thing, it was a practical thing. It\u2019s something that I still do.\u201d",
      "Ross is known as \u201cThe Roastmaster General\u201d for his incendiary takedowns of Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe, Alec Baldwin and Tom Brady, among many others.",
      "The seeds for \u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d were planted in the mid-1990s when Ross gathered jokes and stories about his grandfather for an hourlong set. But digging up the past proved too much.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t sustain it emotionally. It was just too much for me as a 30-year-old guy,\u201d Ross says. \u201cBut now, 30 years later, I can dig in and look back and add a layer of experience over it all.\u201d",
      "He was spurred on in large part to losing three comedic friends \u2014 Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried and Norm Macdonald \u2014 within eight months. \u201cThat motivated me to look back at the old show from decades earlier and rewrite it completely for my current brain and my current skill set.\u201d",
      "Ross will be the latest comedian to come to Broadway, following John Mulaney, Mike Birbiglia, Alex Edelman, Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key, Rachel Dratch, Billy Crystal and Colin Quinn. Bill Burr made his Broadway debut this year in a revival of \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d",
      "Ross reaches back even further. His aunt took him to see Jackie Mason\u2019s \u201cThe World According to Me!\u201d in the 1980s, and the young comedian was floored by the comedian's captivating set.",
      "\u201cIt was elegant, but it was also punk rock because he was being bawdy and naughty and hilarious and saying taboo things and it really, really stayed with me for a long, long time.\u201d",

      "The titles that have packed the most summer moviegoers into theaters since 1975 represent some of the best known films of the last half century, including five \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies, Pixar favorites like \u201cToy Story 3\u201d and \u201cFinding Nemo,\u201d superheroes galore and both \u201cTop Gun\u201d films.

      "Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark",
      "NEW YORK -- Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark.",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film, his second feature, left such a imprint on culture and Hollywood that barely any trip to the movies, let alone to the beach, has been the same since.",
      "Few films have been more perfectly suited to their time and place than \u201cJaws,\u201d which half a century ago unspooled across the country in a then-novel wide release accompanied by Universal Pictures' opening-weekend publicity blitz. \u201cJaws\u201d wasn\u2019t quite the first movie to try to gobble up moviegoers whole, in one mouthful (a few years earlier, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d more or less tried it), but \u201cJaws\u201d established \u2014 and still in many ways defines \u2014 the summer movie.",
      "That puts \u201cJaws\u201d at the birth of a trend that has since consumed Hollywood: the blockbuster era. When it launched in 409 theaters on June 20, 1975, and grossed a then-record $7.9 million in its first days, \u201cJaws\u201d set the template that\u2019s been followed ever-after by every action movie, superhero flick or dinosaur film that\u2019s tried to go big in the summer \u2014 a sleepy time in theaters before \u201cJaws\u201d came around.",
      "And yet the \u201cJaws\u201d legacy is so much more than being Hollywood\u2019s ur-text blockbuster. It\u2019s not possible to, 50 years later, watch Spielberg\u2019s film and see nothing but the beginning of a box-office bonanza, or the paler fish it\u2019s inspired. It\u2019s just too good a movie \u2014 and too much unlike so many wannabes since \u2013\u2014 to be merely groundbreaking. It\u2019s a masterpiece in its own right.",
      "\u201cIt supercharged the language of cinema,\u201d the filmmaker Robert Zemeckis says in the upcoming documentary \u201cJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story,\u201d premiering July 10 on National Geographic.",
      "That documentary, with Spielberg\u2019s participation, is just a small part of the festivities that have accompanied the movie's anniversary. Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201cJaws\u201d was shot, is hosting everything from concerts to \u201cJaws\u201d-themed dog dress-ups. \u201cJaws,\u201d itself, is streaming on Peacock through July 14, along with a prime-time airing Friday on NBC, with an intro from Spielberg. The \u201cJaws\u201d anniversary feels almost more like a national holiday \u2014 and appropriately so.",
      "But if \u201cJaws\u201d is one of the most influential movies ever made, Hollywood hasn't always drawn the right lessons from it. \u201cWe need a bigger boat\u201d has perhaps been taken too literally in movies that have leaned too much on scale and spectacle, when neither of those things really had much to do with the brilliance of Spielberg\u2019s classic.",
      "For the film\u2019s 50th anniversary, we looked at some of the things today's Hollywood could learn from \u201cJaws\" 50 years later.",
      "Every time I rewatch \u201cJaws\u201d \u2014 which I highly recommend doing on some projected screen, even a bedsheet, and preferably with an ocean nearby \u2014 I marvel at how much it gets from its Martha\u2019s Vineyard setting.",
      "Where U.S.-made film productions are shot has been a hot button issue lately. Various incentives often determine movie shooting locations, with set dressings, or CGI, filling in the rest. But \u201cJaws\u201d shows you just how much more than tax credits you can get from a locale.",
      "Spielberg was convinced the adaptation of Peter Benchley\u2019s novel \u2014 inspired by Benchley\u2019s childhood summers on Nantucket \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be done in soundstages. After looking up and down the Atlantic coast, he settled on Nantucket\u2019s neighboring island. Like his first film, the Mojave Desert-set \u201cDuel,\u201d Spielberg wanted his mechanized shark to swim in a real, definable place.",
      "\u201cI felt the same way about \u2018Jaws,\u2019\u201d Spielberg says in the documentary. \u201cI wanted to go to the natural environment so there was some kind of verisimilitude. So it needed to be in the ocean, out to sea.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy. The budget for \u201cJaws\u201d nearly tripled to $9 million and the shoot extended from 55 to 159 days. Spielberg would never again be under financial pressure on a picture, but the tortured \u201cJaws\u201d production put him under a microscope. An AP report from 1975 began: \u201cIt is news when a 26-year-old film director goes $2 million over budget and two and a half months over schedule and manages to avoid getting fired.\u201d",
      "More than any other time in his career, Spielberg fretted.",
      "\u201c\u2018Jaws\u2019 was my Vietnam,\u201d he told Richard Schickel. \u201cIt was basically naive people against nature and nature beat us every day.\u201d",
      "It also infused every inch of the frame with smalltown New England flavor in the way that no soundstage, or CGI, ever could.",
      "When Spielberg was ready to start filming, his star attraction wasn\u2019t. The mechanized shark, nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d after the director\u2019s attorney, suffered frequent failures that forced Spielberg to find different approaches to shooting his shark scenes early in the film.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d instead became, to Spielberg, a kind of homage to Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho.\u201d The suspense came less from the shark than the fear of the unknown and that spine-tingling question: What\u2019s in the water? Spielberg, with the significant aid of John Williams\u2019 instantly iconic score, delayed the appearance of his Great White until well into the film.",
      "\u201cThe visual ellipsis,\u201d the critic Molly Haskell wrote, \u201ccreated far greater menace and terror, as the shark is nowhere and everywhere.\u201d",
      "Spielberg once estimated that Bruce\u2019s mechanical delays added $175 million to the movie\u2019s box office. On its initial run, \u201cJaws\u201d grossed $260.7 million domestically in 1975. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s about $1.5 billion. Nowadays, the shark would almost certainly be done, like most movie creatures, with computer animation. But \u201cJaws\u201d showed that often the most powerful source of dread is our imagination.",
      "This is the time of year when the fate of the world often hangs in the balance. All manner of summer movies have had no bones about destroying cities for a mere plot point. Yet for all its terror, \u201cJaws\" features only a handful of deaths. All of its drama is human-scaled. Compared to more swaggering blockbusters today, \u201cJaws\u201d would be considered a modest, mid-budget movie.",
      "That\u2019s partially why you have to almost remind yourself that the movie has only three main characters in Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw). Casting director Sherry Rhodes peopled the cast with locals from the island, many of whom inject the film with little moments of day-to-day humanity. \u201cJaws,\u201d in that way, feels more like a community than a cast.",
      "On the one hand, \u201cJaws\u201d had little to do directly with its times. The Vietnam War had just ended. Watergate had just led to the resignation of President Nixon. The heart-stopping story of a shark off the Massachusetts shoreline promised escapism.",
      "Yet \u201cJaws\u201d has endured as a parable of capitalism, pulled out time and time again to illustrate those endlessly repeating clashes of cash versus social safety.",
      "\u201cAmity is a summer town,\u201d says Amity\u2019s mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) in the film. \u201cWe need summer dollars.\u201d",
      "The shark gets the theme song and the movie poster, but the real villain of \u201cJaws\u201d wears a pinstripe suit and smiles for the cameras. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a beautiful day and the beaches are open,\u201d he says. More than the predator in the ocean, he, and the town, feast on human flesh.",
      "There are boatloads of movies \u2014 including the three sequels that followed after \u2014 that have tried in vain to capture some of the magic of \u201cJaws.\u201d But what happened in June 1975, let alone on Martha\u2019s Vineyard the year before, isn\u2019t repeatable. Even the greatest movies are products of a thousand small miracles. That title? Benchley came up with it minutes before going to print. The iconic poster came from Roger Kastel's painting for the book. Scheider, for instance, learned about the movie by overhearing Spielberg at a party. Williams relied on just two notes for one of the most widely known film scores in movie history.",
      "But no ingredient mattered more on \u201cJaws\u201d than the man behind the camera. Filmmaking talents like Spielberg come around maybe a couple times a century, and in \u201cJaws,\u201d he emerged, spectacularly. What's maybe most striking about \u201cJaws\u201d 50 years later is how much it still doesn't look like anything else.",
      "___",
      "Jake Coyle has been writing about movies for the AP since 2013. He's seen \u201cJaws\u201d at least a dozen times, and screened it for his kids when they were debatably too young for it.",

      "Bruce Springsteen has been deliberate in his career, careful with his album releases to keep a narrative flow and not repeat himself",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bruce Springsteen's new project, \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums,\u201d is entirely about that age-old question: What if?",
      "The box set, out June 27, comprises seven albums encompassing the period between 1983 and 2018, all but one he prepared to release in its time but ultimately shelved. Now that he's decided to drop them simultaneously, they offer a fascinating alternative story of his musical life.",
      "Building on its predecessor \u201cTracks,\u201d 1998's four-disc, 66-song collection of unreleased material, there are 83 songs here. While some slipped out on other projects \u2014 \u201cMy Hometown\u201d and \u201cSecret Garden\u201d among them \u2014 the vast majority hadn't been heard publicly. This is all fully completed material, not half-baked or half-finished outtakes. It's not unusual for artists to leave songs \u2014 or even full-lengths \u2014 on the cutting-room floor, but multiple entire albums? Springsteen explains that he's taken care releasing albums, looking to build a narrative arc for his career, and believes this approach has served him well.",
      "Perhaps as a result, the most interesting work on \u201cTracks II\u201d comes when he stretches out and explores pathways not in his wheelhouse: countrypolitan Bruce, border-town Bruce, Burt Bacharach-inspired Bruce and a set of synthesizer-based songs modeled after his Oscar-winning \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d Oddly, the one disc of strays cobbled together that feels most like an E Street Band record is the least compelling.",
      "Since these are seven distinct albums, it's worth evaluating them that way.",
      "\u201cLA Garage Sessions '83\u201d captures Springsteen working virtually alone at a home in the Hollywood Hills. It was squarely in between his \u201cNebraska\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d albums, and he seems torn between those two approaches. There are character studies here, and more lighthearted fare like \u201cLittle Girl Like You,\u201d with a single man yearning to settle down. The most striking cut is \u201cThe Klansman,\u201d about a boy and his racist father, yet it cries out for more development. Ultimately, Springsteen chose the right albums to release at the time.",
      "The song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d was a genuine departure musically, and Springsteen decided to make an album in the same vein, with synthesizers and drum loops the dominant elements. If released in the early 1990s, this would have been the most contemporary-sounding disc of his career, with atmospherics that occasionally recall U2. Springsteen pulled it at the last minute, reasoning that the stories of doomed relationships \u2014 sample lyric: \u201cWe loved each other like a disease\u201d \u2014 was too much like \u201cTunnel of Love.\u201d",
      "At the same time he recorded \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d in 1995, Springsteen also convened a country band steered by pedal steel player Marty Rifkin. Their work was terrific, led by the one-two punch of \u201cRepo Man\u201d and the Johnny Rivers cover, \u201cPoor Side of Town.\u201d The title cut to a disc he calls \u201cSomewhere North of Nashville\u201d escaped into the public some two decades later. Since the somber \u201cJoad\u201d won a Grammy, who are we to second-guess his choice of what to put out? \u201cNashville,\u201d though, is a rollicking good time.",
      "\u201cInyo\u201d is similar to \u201cJoad\u201d and \u201cDevils & Dust,\u201d mostly acoustic-based narratives, here many of them stories of the Southwest. Springsteen even appropriately brings in mariachi bands for \u201cAdelita\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Charro.\u201d Soozie Tyrell's violin is notable, particularly on the majestic \u201cWhen I Build My Beautiful House.\u201d We're guessing that Springsteen may have considered \u201cInyo\u201d one album too many in the same style, but it's still strong work.",
      "At one point Springsteen considered making \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d his salute to early 1970s California songwriting, a double album. When he didn't, the songs on \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d were left behind. Here Bacharach is the primary influence, and this almost feels like Elvis Costello's collaboration with Burt, only without him (and is the lyric \u201cGod give me strength\u201d a hat-tip to that project?). The crooning Bruce of \u201cSunday Love\u201d is spellbinding, maybe the box's best song. \u201cLonely Town\u201d sits at the intersection of Bacharach and Roy Orbison, while \u201cDinner at Eight\u201d is a lovely sum-up. \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d may startle Springsteen fans \u2014 and impress them, too.",
      "The workmanlike songs on \u201cFaithless\u201d were written on commission in two weeks, the soundtrack to a movie that was never made. It's a good bet it would have been a moody Western.",
      "When Springsteen duels with Tom Morello on the song \u201cAnother Thin Line,\u201d you realize how little you've heard his electric guitar on \u201cTracks II.\u201d The album \u201cPerfect World\u201d is the one here made up of leftovers from different periods, with the greatest E Street Band participation. Here's the deal, though: Most good E Street Band material has already been released. The best left behind for this disc is \u201cYou Lifted Me Up,\u201d with minimalist lyrics and a vocal collaboration with Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt.",
      "The box gives Springsteen completists plenty to mull over, and you can question whether these \u201clost discs\u201d would get more attention released separately instead of together. If it's too much, he's releasing a 20-song set of its highlights.",

      "Competitive eater Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut announced Monday he will return to compete in this year's Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after skipping last year's gastronomic battle for the coveted Mustard Belt.",
      "\u201cThis event means the world to me,\u201d Chestnut, 41, said in a message posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s a cherished tradition, a celebration of American culture, and a huge part of my life.\u201d",
      "It will mark the 20th appearance for the Indiana eater at the Coney Island contest.",
      "Last year, Major League Eating event organizer George Shea said Chestnut, who has won the 10-minute eat-a-thon 16 times, would not be participating due to a contract dispute. Chestnut had struck a deal with a competing brand, the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods.",
      "In a phone interview Monday, the competitive eater made it clear he never appeared in any commercials for the company's vegan hot dogs and that Nathan's is the only hot dog company he has worked with. But Chestnut acknowledged he \u201cshould have made that more clear with Nathan\u2019s.\"",
      "\u201cThere was a little bit of communication that we could have improved on last year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I, yeah, I think we figured it out. It took a little bit of finessing.\u201d",
      "Chestnut is still working with Impossible Foods and said \u201cclarifications\u201d have been made to his respective contracts.",
      "Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating, said he did not want to rehash what happened last year because he found it \u201cdispiriting,\u201d but said he\u2019s happy \u201ceverything is resolved\u201d now.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the return of the greatest competitive eater of all time to the biggest competitive eating event of all time. So I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger in any sport,\u201d Shea said. \u201cI mean, this guy is the greatest performer we\u2019ve ever seen in Coney Island and in competitive eating.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he heard from fans over the past year who wanted him to return to the Coney Island event, which is broadcast live on ESPN and even shown overseas.",
      "Last year, he opted to compete against soldiers in Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, in a 5-minute hot dog eating contest. Back in New York, Patrick Bertoletti gobbled up 58 hot dogs to win his first men\u2019s title while defending champion Miki Sudo won her 10th title in the women's division, downing a record 51 links.",
      "Chestnut holds the world record of eating 76 hot dogs.",
      "\u201cOver the last year, I ran into a lot of people who said that it wasn\u2019t the same without me. And I told many people that I was going to work really hard to make sure I got back there,\u201d Chestnut said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy that Nathan\u2019s and Major League Eating, we were able all to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he been prepping for the big event and has a couple practice sessions left before the July Fourth holiday.",
      "\u201cMy body's in tune right now,\u201d he said, explaining how he has to build tolerance for consuming so many hot dogs and \u201cget all those muscles used to working together.\u201d He likened the process to boxer getting in practice rounds before a big fight.",
      "Chestnut made it clear his business relationship with Impossible Foods does not mean he has become a vegan, an assumption he said some fans made last year. Chestnut said he was surprised by the \u201cweird blowback\u201d he received about it, explaining he eats a plant-based diet during his recovery from competitive eating events.",
      "\u201cI love meat. I\u2019m going to continue to eat meat. But when I recover from a contest, I have to eat super clean in order to get my body to try to get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t eat pounds of meat every day.\u201d",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.",

      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Recording Academy has tweaked some of its rules for the 2026 Grammy Awards, including carving out a stand-alone category for best album cover \u2014 a day after Sabrina Carpenter sparked considerable discourse unveiling what is believed to be the cover for her next album.",
      "The academy on Thursday announced that the best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories will be combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own. The last Grammy for best recording package went to \u201cBrat,\u201d the Charli xcx album whose distinctive cover was immediately embraced by pop culture and meme creators.",
      "\u201cThe Academy\u2019s top priority is to represent the music people that we serve each year,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy said in a statement. \u201cThat entails listening carefully to our members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today\u2019s music and allow us to accurately recognize as many deserving creators as possible.\u201d",
      "Carpenter revealed the title and release date for her new album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d on Wednesday. The image shows Carpenter, dressed in a black dress and high heels, kneeling on the ground in a dog-like pose while an unseen person pulls her by the hair. On social media, some fans said the image was demeaning while others argued it was satirical.",
      "The album would be eligible for the new category if she releases \u201cMan's Best Friend\u201d on Aug. 29, as promised. The Grammy eligibility period closes the next day.",
      "Other Grammy changes include the creation of a best traditional country album category, while the existing best country album category has been renamed best contemporary country album. (Beyonc\u00e9 won best country album at the 2025 Grammy Awards for \"Cowboy Carter.\")",
      "The best new artist category has also been expanded to include acts who were featured on previous album of the year nominees, so long as they fall below 20% of the album\u2019s music.",
      "The Grammys will be held Feb. 1 at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with nominations set to be announced on Nov. 7.",

      "Willie Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl could have been mistaken for a retirement party.",
      "But two years later at 92, he's working as much as ever. Not that retirement would look much different. The life he loves is making music with his friends, even after outliving so many dear ones.",
      "Nelson will be on the road again with Bob Dylan when the Outlaw Music Festival resumes for the second leg of its 10th year starting on June 20 in Clarkston, Michigan",
      "Asked if he\u2019d ever like his life to get the feature film treatment that Dylan did last year with \u201cA Complete Unknown, \u201d Nelson said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some talk about it. But I'm not through with it yet.\u201d",
      "Nelson spoke to The Associated Press in a phone interview from Hawaii's Oahu.",
      "\u201cBob's a good friend,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I'll be glad to let him headline.\u201d",
      "The tour is one part of a loaded year. It'll lead right up to the 40th anniversary of Farm Aid in September. This spring, Nelson released his 77th studio album. And he's added a new THC tonic, Willie's Remedy, to his wide world of weed products.",
      "Nelson has always loved singing the songs of his friends as much as if not more than the ones he writes himself. In 1979, he released \u201cWillie Nelson Sings Kristofferson,\u201d a full album of the work of his friend Kris Kristofferson, who died last year.",
      "He has similar love for the songs of his friend Rodney Crowell. Nelson has long performed Crowell's \u201cTil I Gain Control Again,\u201d which he called \u201cone of the best country songs that I think I've ever heard.\u201d Now he's released a whole album of Crowell tunes, \u201cOh What a Beautiful World.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t written one that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The album comes on the 50th anniversary of \u201cRed Headed Stranger,\u201d the album that many consider Nelson's masterpiece. A breakthrough for him at age 42, it took him from respected journeyman to beloved superstar.",
      "Nelson said he's already begun work on album number 78, but declines to share its direction.",
      "As Nelson returns to the road, the only surviving member of the classic lineup of his Family band is Mickey Raphael, 73, whose harmonica has duetted for decades with the Willie warble.",
      "Bassist Bee Spears died in 2011. Guitarist and backup singer Jody Payne died in 2013. Drummer Paul English died in 2020. And Nelson's sister Bobbie Nelson, his only sibling and his piano player, died in 2022.",
      "But the band he takes on the road now is just as familial in its own way. It often includes his sons Lukas and Micah. English's brother Billy plays the drums. The son of Payne and singer Sammi Smith, Waylon Payne, plays guitar.",
      "They collectively keep up with Nelson's wants and whims on stage. One thing the live show never includes is a set list. He refuses to use them. Band members \u2014 and sound guys, and lighting guys \u2014 have to stay on their toes and be ready for anything.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather play it off the top of my head, because I can read the crowd pretty good,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThey jump in there.\u201d",
      "The list-less set lately has included classics like \u201cWhiskey River\u201d (always the opener, no guessing to be done there,) and \u201cBloody Mary Morning\u201d along with newer adoptees like Tom Waits' \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d a song that perfectly expresses Nelson's survivor status.",
      "\u201cI'm the last leaf on the tree,\u201d Nelson sings in the song that leads his 2024 album of the same name. \u201cThe autumn took the rest, but it won't take me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy son Micah found that for me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI really love the song, and the audience likes it, it\u2019s one of the real good ones.\u201d",
      "He's also been performing songs written by Micah, who records and performs as Particle Boy.",
      "One favorite, \u201cEverything Is B- - - - - -t,\u201d seems to stand in contrast to the gospel standards like \u201cI'll Fly Away\u201d and \u201cWill The Circle Be Unbroken\u201d that he often plays a few minutes later. Willie disagrees.",
      "\u201cIt's all gospel,\u201d he says with a laugh.",

It was inspired by one-off charity concerts like \u201cLive Aid,\u201d but became an annual institution, rotating each year to a different farm-adjacent city. It's in Minneapolis this year.",

      "Thanks to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, the renamed marvel will now lift off into the sky each summer evening \u2014 a ghostly echo of last year\u2019s opening ceremony \u2014 from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but not the spectacle. The 30-meter-tall (98-foot-tall) floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those monuments in Paris that could stay,\u201d said Laurent Bro\u00e9ze, a local architect pausing in the gardens on Thursday. \u201cIt was set up temporarily, but a bit like the Eiffel Tower, it makes sense for it to return. It\u2019s a bit of a shame they want to take it down later, but maybe it could be installed somewhere else, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron\u2019s original aluminum-and-balloon build was only meant to be temporary \u2014 not engineered for multiyear outdoor exposure.",
      "To transform it into a summer staple, engineers reinforced it: The aluminum ring and tether points were rebuilt with tougher components to handle rain, sun and temperature changes over several seasons.",
      "A\u00e9rophile, Paris\u2019s tethered balloon specialist, redesigned the winch and tether system to meet aviation rules, allowing safe operation in winds up to 20\u201325 kph (12-15 mph).",
      "Hydraulic, electrical, and misting systems were fortified \u2014 not only to ensure smooth nightly flights but to endure months of wear and tear untested on the original design. These retrofits shift the cauldron from a fragile, one-off spectacle to a resilient, summerlong landmark \u2014 prepared to withstand everything Paris summers can throw at it.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Paris 2024 Games, ignited on July 26 by Olympic champions Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec and Teddy Riner. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now perched in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Visitors have already begun to gather.",
      "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said Javier Smith, a tourist from Texas. \u201cAnd the place where it\u2019s going to be, or is sitting now, it\u2019s beautiful. All these beautiful buildings, the Louvre, all that is fantastic.\u201d",
      "Access is free and unticketed. The cauldron will be on display from morning to night, igniting with light from 10 a.m. and lifting off each evening after the garden closes \u2014 10:30 p.m. in June and July, with earlier times through September. It will float above the city for several hours before quietly descending around 1 a.m.",
      "The \u201cflame,\u201d while entirely electric, still conjures a sense of Olympic poetry.",
      "\u201cYes, we came for a little outing focused on the statues related to mythology in the Tuileries Garden,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Solana, a teacher visiting with her students. \u201cBut it\u2019s true we\u2019re also taking advantage of the opportunity, because last week the Olympic cauldron wasn\u2019t here yet, so it was really nice to be able to show it to the students.\u201d",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "It no longer carries the Olympic name. But this phoenix-like cauldron is still lifting Paris into the clouds \u2014 and into memory.",

      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "Cancer patients say they\u2019ve grown sicker since Argentina\u2019s radical libertarian President Javier Milei took his chainsaw to the public health system",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- To outsiders, the Facebook group chat reads like a snarl of nonsensical emojis and letters. To uninsured Argentine cancer patients, it\u2019s a lifeline.",
      "The surreptitious network connects advocates who have spare drugs to Argentines with cancer who lost access to their treatment in March 2024 when President Javier Milei suspended a federal agency, known as DADSE, that paid for their expensive medications.",
      "Whenever Facebook cracks the coded pleas and removes the group for violating its rules on drug sales, another appears, swelling with Argentines who say they\u2019ve grown sicker since the radical libertarian president took a chainsaw to health care.",
      "\u201cAll I need for my body to function is this medication, and Milei is saying, \u2018There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d said Ariel Wagener, a 47-year-old pizza chef with leukemia who was hospitalized this year with failing kidneys after losing access to his medication. Without DADSE, a month's worth of his leukemia drug costs $21,000.",
      "Wagener's condition stabilized after he got leftover medication via Facebook, donated by a family whose loved one had died of cancer.",
      "The halting of millions of dollars of free cancer drugs is just one way Milei\u2019s austerity drive has torn through the public health system that once set Argentina apart in Latin America, ensuring that health care was free for pretty much everyone who couldn't afford private insurance.",
      "Since taking office in December 2023, Milei has slashed Argentina\u2019s health care budget by 48% in real terms. His administration fired over 2,000 Health Ministry employees, including 1,400 over just a few days in January.",
      "As part of Milei\u2019s plan to remake Argentina\u2019s troubled economy and cut waste and bureaucracy, officials gutted the National Cancer Institute, suspending early detection programs for breast and cervical cancer.",
      "They froze federal funds for immunization campaigns, hobbling vaccine access as Argentina confronts a measles outbreak for the first time in decades. They dismantled the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis, leading to testing and treatment delays. They defunded emergency contraception and stopped distributing abortion pills.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing setbacks we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Boriotti, president of Argentina\u2019s Federation of Health Professionals. \"HIV patients without treatment, cancer patients dying for lack of medication, hospitals without resources, health professionals pushed out of the system.\"",
      "The government curtailed medical coverage for retirees and lifted price controls on prescription medication and private health plans, causing prices to spike by 250% and 118% respectively, official data shows.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped buying milk, yogurt, anything that\u2019s not absolutely essential,\u201d said Susana Pecora, 71, who lost the insurance plan that covered her husband's antipsychotic drugs when the price jumped 40% last year.",
      "Milei campaigned on a promise to shrink the state two years before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk took up their own chainsaws.",
      "The Argentine has become a close ally of the Trump administration, including on health policy. Argentina has followed the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, and last month received a visit from U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Meeting Kennedy in Buenos Aires, Argentine Health Minister Mario Lugones announced a review of Argentina's health system to align it with Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.",
      "\u201cWe have similar visions about the path forward,\u201d Lugones said of Kennedy.",
      "Milei has not yet attempted to replace universal coverage with an insurance-based system, as he vowed on the campaign trail.",
      "But in stripping Argentines of coverage and increasing premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he is moving Argentina closer to the U.S. model, said Macarena Sabin Paz, health team coordinator at Argentina\u2019s Center for Legal and Social Studies.",
      "\u201cWe are beginning to see the idea ... where if you lose your job, or become seriously ill, you may have to sell your car, whatever you have, to pay for health care,\" she said.",
      "Milei\u2019s staffing cuts have eviscerated agencies tasked with planning, financing and tracking immunization campaigns, disrupting data collection and jeopardizing the country\u2019s respected childhood vaccine program.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a measles outbreak that in April led to Argentina's first measles death in two decades.",
      "\u201cArgentina has been one of the most advanced South American countries and here we see it abandoning public health,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Plotkin, an American physician who helped develop the measles vaccine in the 1960s.",
      "Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, did not respond to requests for comment. Lugones also did not respond to questions on the impact of policy changes.",
      "After decades of unbridled spending by left-wing populist governments that brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts, Milei delivered on his campaign promises of taming extreme inflation and notching a fiscal surplus.",
      "But even experts who agree Argentina\u2019s health care system needed reform say the cutbacks have been so deep and fast that they\u2019ve hit like a tidal wave.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the destruction of the state, we\u2019ve never experienced anything like this, not even during the military dictatorship,\u201d said Fabio Nu\u00f1ez, ex-coordinator of the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis who was among hundreds fired from the agency.",
      "Charged with leading prevention efforts and treatments for infectious diseases, the agency has lost 40% of its staff and 76% of its annual budget. Hospitals now face shortages of everything from virus testing supplies to medications to condoms.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a surge in sexually transmitted infections. Last year HIV cases spiked by 20% and syphilis by 50%.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re avoiding the expense now but will pay for it later as people seek emergency care,\u201d said Cristian Pizzuti, a 31-year-old with HIV who documented 103 cases of patients deprived of their daily antiretroviral pills for weeks at a time last year. Pizzuti said he recently received expired medication and suffered a severe allergic reaction after being switched to a cheaper drug.",
      "Tuberculosis cases also climbed by 25% last year. TB clinics report delays in obtaining test results.",
      "\u201cAs people go about their lives, waiting for results, they are spreading the disease to others,\u201d said Dr. Santiago Jimenez, who treats HIV and TB patients in an impoverished Buenos Aires neighborhood. \"It\u2019s an epidemiological disaster.\u201d",
      "Free public hospitals have become flooded with Argentines who dropped their private insurance due to increased premiums or who lost their job \u2014 and with it, their social security plans funded through payroll contributions. Buenos Aires facilities reported a 20%-30% increase in demand in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "The strain was visible at the free public Rodolfo Rossi Hospital in La Plata last month, where crowds jostled in the outpatient clinic and long lines spilled from the pharmacy.",
      "Pharmacists have reported drug shortages as mass layoffs caused administrative chaos and the government froze a program that provided basic medications to Argentine public health centers.",
      "Silvana Mansilla, 43, spent half the day waiting to pick up her monthly supply of thyroid medication \u2014 which has doubled in price to $22 \u2014 only to find the hospital had run out. \u201cWhere\u2019s the government? What are they doing about this?\u201d she asked.",
      "With hiring frozen, doctors said they're handling double the patient load.",
      "Overwhelmed by ever-increasing workloads, Argentina\u2019s leading public Garrahan Pediatric Hospital in Buenos Aires has hemorrhaged 200 medical professionals since Milei took office.",
      "As annual inflation neared 200% last fall, their salaries lost half of their purchasing power. Doctors left for jobs abroad or better-paying work in private clinics. None were replaced. Medical residents ran a weeklong strike in May, displaying their pay slips for a month of 70-hour work weeks: $700.",
      "A lawsuit filed by patient advocacy groups said more than 60 cancer patients have died due to the government\u2019s suspension of the DADSE medication program, and over 1,500 patients were waiting for their drugs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the government to reinstate the drug deliveries, but it appealed, arguing that DADSE no longer exists. It said it had created a new, more efficient program to fulfill outstanding requests. But the timeline varies and sometimes the drugs don't come at all.",
      "Timing was everything for patients like Alexis Almir\u00f3n.",
      "His medical records show the government drug bank received his request for an expensive medication to shrink his malignant tumor on Dec. 11, 2023, the day after Milei\u2019s inauguration. His doctor told the agency immediate treatment was urgently needed for the aggressive cancer.",
      "Months passed. His mother, Claudia Caballero, bombarded DADSE with desperate calls asking what was taking so long as Almir\u00f3n\u2019s lymphoma spread from his neck to his brain and stomach. He vomited blood. He lost his eyesight. Caballero tried to crowd-source the $20,000 for a month\u2019s supply of the drug but couldn't raise enough.",
      "On March 12 last year, Almir\u00f3n died at 22.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give him the chance to choose to live,\u201d Caballero said, her voice breaking.",
      "The day after she buried her son, Caballero received a call from the Health Ministry. They had good news, the caller said: Her son\u2019s medication had finally arrived.",

      "Older U.S. adults are increasingly dying from unintentional falls, and white people account for the vast majority of the deaths",
      "NEW YORK -- Older U.S. adults are increasingly dying from unintentional falls, according to a new federal report published Wednesday, with white people accounting for the vast majority of the deaths.",
      "From 2003 to 2023, death rates from falls rose more than 70% for adults ages 65 to 74, the report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The rate increased more than 75% for people 75 to 84, and more than doubled for seniors 85 and older.",
      "\u201cFalls continue to be a public health problem worth paying attention to,\u201d said Geoffrey Hoffman, a University of Michigan researcher who was not involved in the new report. \u201cIt's curious that these rates keep rising.\u201d",
      "The CDC researchers did not try to answer why death rates from falls are increasing. But experts say there may be a few reasons, like gradually improving our understanding of the the role falls play in deaths and more people living longer \u2014 to ages when falls are more likely to have deadly consequences.",
      "More than 41,000 retirement-age Americans died of falls in 2023, the most recent year for which final statistics based on death certificates are available. That suggests that falls were blamed in about 1 of every 56 deaths in older Americans that year.",
      "More than half of those 41,000 deaths were people 85 and older, the CDC found, and white people accounted for 87% of deaths in the oldest category.",
      "Falls can cause head injuries or broken bones that can lead to permanent disability and trigger a cascade of other health problems. A number of factors can contribute to falls, including changes in hearing and vision and medications that can cause light-headedness.",
      "Death rates varied widely from state to state. In 2023, Wisconsin had the highest death rates from falls, followed by Minnesota, Maine, Oklahoma and Vermont. Wisconsin's rate was more than five times higher than the rate of the lowest state, Alabama.",
      "Ice and wintry weather may partly explain why fatal falls were more common in states in the upper Midwest and New England, but experts also pointed to other things at play, like differences in how well falls are reported and to what extent they are labeled a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWe've yet to unravel why you see such differences in state rates,\u201d said Hoffman, who studies falls among the elderly.",
      "Researchers also can't yet explain why white seniors die of falls at higher rates than people in other racial and ethnic groups. In the 85-and-up age group, the death rate for white Americans is two or three times higher than any other group, while older Black people had the lowest fall-related death rate.",
      "\u201cKind of a flip of the traditional disparity lens,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the fact that for most other rates of illness and injury, people of color are disproportionately affected.",
      "Staying active can help people avoid falls, experts say.",

      "It's the second such federal ruling to reinstate public health funding for several states.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday sought by district attorneys in Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, and three cities: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and Kansas City, Missouri. The decision means the federal government must reinstate funding to the four municipalities until the case is fully litigated.",
      "\u201cThe federal government cannot simply ignore Congress and pull the plug on essential services that communities rely on,\u201d Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision ensures we can keep doing the work that protects our residents \u2014 from tracking disease outbreaks to providing vaccinations and supporting vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "Their lawsuit, filed in late April, alleged $11 billion in cuts to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention programs had already been approved by Congress and are being unconstitutionally withheld. They also argued that the administration\u2019s actions violate Department of Health and Human Services regulations.",
      "The cities and counties argued the cuts were \u201ca massive blow to U.S. public health at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.\u201d The cuts would lead to thousands of state and local public health employees being fired, the lawsuit argued.",
      "The local governments, alongside the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, wanted the court to reinstate the grants nationwide. But Cooper said in his preliminary injunction that the funds can only be blocked to the four municipalities and in a May 21 hearing expressed skepticism about whether it could apply more widely.",
      "The funding in question was granted during the COVID-19 pandemic but aimed at building up public health infrastructure overall, Menefee said in a statement in April.",
      "The four local governments were owed about $32.7 million in future grant payments, Cooper's opinion notes.",
      "The federal government's lawyers said the grants were legally cut because, \"Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out.\u201d They used the same argument in the case brought by 23 states and the District of Columbia over the HHS funding clawback.",
      "Menefee said the cuts defunded programs in Harris County for wastewater disease surveillance, community health workers and clinics and call centers that helped people get vaccinated. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said the cuts forced the city to fire 11 of its 22 infectious disease staffers.",
      "Nashville used some of its grant money to support programs, including a \u201cstrike team\u201d that after the pandemic addressed gaps in health services that kept kids from being able to enroll in school, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Kansas City used one of its grants to build out capabilities to test locally for COVID-19, influenza and measles rather than waiting for results from the county lab. The suit details that after four years of work to certify facilities and train staff, the city \u201cwas at the final step\" of buying lab equipment when the grant was canceled.",

      "April Newkirk told WXIA-TV that 31-year-old Adriana Smith's baby was born prematurely by an emergency cesarean section early Friday, the Atlanta station reported Monday night. She was about six months into her pregnancy. The baby, named Chance, weighs about 1 pound and 13 ounces and is in the neonatal intensive care unit.",

      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than four months ago and went to Atlanta\u2019s Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain-dead. She was eight weeks pregnant, according to WXIA.",

    "summary": "Three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the funding system for abortions is battered",
    "story": [
      "Three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the funding system for abortions is battered",
      "The abortion funding system across the U.S. is battered three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans.",
      "An initial surge of donations has subsided, scores of clinics have closed and advocates fear that federal policy changes will result in more shutting down.",
      "\u201cWe're all collectively struggling,\u201d said Ramsie Monk, director of development at the Women's Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, which opened a clinic in 2023 in western Maryland after abortion was banned in West Virginia.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sustainable model,\u201d said Mercedes Sanchez, executive director at the Cedar River Clinics in Washington. \u201cClinics, providers, funds are all very committed to making sure people can access care, but it is definitely going to be more of a challenge.\u201d",
      "Bans in some states mean travel has become a bigger part of obtaining an abortion, bring a host of costs.",
      "A mitigating factor is that most abortions are now done with medications. They can be prescribed by telehealth, including to women in states where abortion is banned. But they can't be used in every case, some women prefer procedures, and there are challenges to the legality of pills and how they're prescribed.",
      "Not all private insurance plans cover abortions. Federal taxpayer funds cannot be used for abortions, but state Medicaid funds cover them in some places. And a network of private funding helps cover procedures or travel and other costs.",
      "The increase in contributions that followed the 2022 Supreme Court ruling has declined for most funds and clinics. \u201cThe resources have not kept pace with demand continuing to surge,\u201d Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund.",
      "With bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy now being enforced in 12 states and bans at about six weeks' gestation being enforced in four others, travel for abortion has become more frequent. Costs for each trip can include plane tickets or gas for long drives, meals, hotels and child care \u2014 all on top of clinic fees.",
      "Last year, the National Abortion Federation's hotline fund reduced the portion of clinic costs it covers for people with financial needs to 30% from 50% so it could help more people as demand increased. The group's says travel costs now average over $1,000 per person.",
      "Travel needs have made the job for abortion funds not only more expensive but more intricate.",
      "Before the Texas ban started in 2021, Fund Texas Choice got about 40 calls a month, executive director Anna Rupani said. Now, it's over 200. And assisting each caller can take more time because they involve arranging flights and hotels, not just lining up rides to clinics in the state.",
      "Some people cobble together money from a hodgepodge of groups to pay for an abortion. Grace McGarry, who manages the phone line for Whole Woman's Health, which operates five clinics across the U.S., said he talked to a patient who was getting aid from nine different groups.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, I Need An A, which operates a website dedicated to providing information about abortion options, has tallied 105 clinics closing.",
      "Twenty-nine closures were in states where abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy. Eleven were in states where it's banned at about six weeks' gestation, before many women realize they're pregnant. But 65 of the closures were in other states.",
      "At the same time, 34 clinics have opened anew or moved to states where abortion is legal.",
      "\u201cEach and every one of those has been a blow to that community that hasn\u2019t been refilled,\u201d said Rebecca Nall, the founder of I Need An A.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States announced in May that it would close eight locations in Iowa and Minnesota while expanding services at some other clinics.",
      "Ruth Richardson, the CEO of that Planned Parenthood affiliate, said the reorganization recognizes that the number of abortions in Iowa plummeted after the state started enforcing its strict abortion law. It also reflects that the regional group's overall budget is down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the compounded challenges of the fact that sexual and reproductive health care has been politicized in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the closures are warranted: \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s focus is squarely on abortions, gender transitions and political spending.\u201d",
      "In March, the Department of Health and Human Services withheld $27.5 million that groups were expecting to provide family planning, contraception, cancer screening and sexually transmitted infection tests and treatment. Some of the groups also provide abortions and include at least 11 regional Planned Parenthood affiliates.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely in a public health crisis of epic proportions,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. \"We\u2019re in a situation where there are reproductive health care deserts, not just abortion care deserts.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's tax and budget bill that is up for consideration in the Senate after getting House approval would deliver more blows to abortion funding.",
      "It would bar federally subsidized health insurance plans from covering abortion, except if it's necessary to save the life of the woman, or in cases of rape or incest.",
      "The bill also would bar Medicaid funds from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood said those provisions could lead to the closures of about half its clinics that provide abortion \u2014- and about one-fourth of abortion clinics nationwide. The biggest impact on affiliate clinics would be in states where abortion is legal.",
      "Alexis McGill-Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said it's almost been a challenge to fund abortion \u2014 and all health care \u2014 for low-income people.",
      "\u201cIf the market could have figured it out,\" she said, \"then we wouldn't exist.\u201d",

      "The move comes nearly two months after U.S. health officials said that they would urge foodmakers to phase out petroleum-based artificial colors in the nation\u2019s food supply.",
      "Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that almost 90% of its U.S. products already don't contain food, drug & cosmetic colors, but that the products that do still use the dyes will have them removed by the end of 2027. FD&C colors are synthetic additives that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food, drugs and cosmetics.",
      "Kraft Heinz said that many of its U.S. products that still use the FD&C colors are in its beverage and desserts categories, including certain products sold under brands including Crystal Light, Kool Aid, Jell-O and Jet Puffed.",
      "The company said that it will instead use natural colors for the products.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of our products use natural or no colors, and we\u2019ve been on a journey to reduce our use of FD&C colors across the remainder of our portfolio,\" Pedro Navio, North America President at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz stripped artificial colors, flavors and preservatives from its macaroni and cheese in 2016 and said it has never used artificial dyes in its ketchup.",
      "The company plans to work with licensees of its brands to encourage them to remove the dyes.",
      "In April Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference that the agency would take steps to eliminate the synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children. The FDA has maintained that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes. In January, the agency announced that the dye known as Red 3 \u2014 used in candies, cakes and some medications \u2014 would be banned in food by 2027 because it caused cancer in laboratory rats.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes. Several states, including California and West Virginia, have passed laws restricting the use of artificial colors in foods.",
      "Many U.S. food companies are already reformulating their foods, according to Sensient Colors, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of food dyes and flavorings. In place of synthetic dyes, foodmakers can use natural hues made from beets, algae and crushed insects and pigments from purple sweet potatoes, radishes and red cabbage.",

      "A former Ohio doctor who was fired before being found not guilty on murder charges in the deaths of 14 patients has lost a defamation lawsuit against his former employers",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A former Ohio doctor who was fired before being found not guilty on murder charges in the deaths of 14 patients lost a defamation lawsuit against his former employers on Monday, after a judge stepped in for a jury on grounds the evidence presented by the defendants was incontrovertible.",
      "Franklin County Judge Stephen McIntosh issued his directed verdict against former doctor William Husel, whose attorneys accused Michigan-based Trinity Health and Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus of orchestrating a campaign to destroy his reputation.",
      "Husel was seeking more than $18 million from the health care companies.",
      "His attorney, David Vermillion, said in a statement that Husel's legal team was disappointed that McIntosh would prevent the jury from making a decision in the case after weeks of evidence and testimony had been presented. He said issuing the directed verdict, a procedural move requested by the hospital, \u201ceffectively silences the voices of those who came seeking justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the outcome that any reasonable person expected, nor is it one that reflects the strength of the evidence presented,\" he said. \u201cWe are evaluating all legal options, including appeal. This case has always been about more than one courtroom or one ruling. It is about truth, accountability, and the right of every individual to defend their name against false and damaging accusations.\u201d",
      "Mount Carmel issued a statement that said simply, \u201cWe are pleased with the judge\u2019s decision.\u201d",
      "Mount Carmel Health System fired the doctor in 2018 after it concluded he had ordered excessive painkillers for about three dozen patients who died over several years.",
      "He initially was charged with murder in 25 deaths in one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against a U.S. health care professional. Eleven counts were dismissed before trial.",
      "Husel, now 49, maintained he was trying to help patients deal with their pain, sometimes in the last moments of their life, not speed up their deaths. Despite being found not guilty by a jury on murder charges in 2022, he permanently surrendered his medical license.",
      "He filed multiple lawsuits against his former employer, accusing Trinity Health and Mount Carmel of defamation and malicious prosecution.",
      "As part of the defamation lawsuit filed in 2019, Husel\u2019s attorneys said Trinity Health repeatedly spread lies and false information to convince the public and law enforcement that Husel was a killer, even though health system officials knew that was not true.",
      "\u201cObviously, these false allegations destroyed Dr. Husel\u2019s life,\u201d the lawsuit said. Husel gave up his medical license because his lawyers said that he knew the damage to his reputation would prevent him from working as a doctor.",
      "In court documents filed two years ago, Husel said he had been unable to find work and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.",
      "Trinity Health had asked a judge to toss the lawsuit, but a Franklin County judge ruled there was enough reason to move forward.",
      "Husel, who worked in the intensive care unit, was charged in cases that involved the use of at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for nonsurgical situations indicated an intent to end lives.",
      "His colleagues who administered the medications at Mount Carmel West Hospital in Columbus weren\u2019t criminally charged, but the hospital said it fired 23 nurses, pharmacists and managers after its internal investigation and referred various employees to their respective state boards for disciplinary action.",
      "The hospital reached settlements in multiple cases involving relatives of the patients who died.",

      "Midway up the Appalachian Trail, a little country store in Gardners, Pennsylvania, invites hikers to take on an additional challenge: eating a half-gallon of ice cream in one sitting",
      "GARDNERS, Pa. -- Sam Cooper had just trekked 7 miles (11 kilometers) through a rain-sodden stretch of the Appalachian Trail when he sat down outside a little country store in Pennsylvania to take on its ice cream challenge.",
      "Nearly 40 minutes and 2,500 calories later, the dairy farmer from Chapel Hill, Tennessee, was polishing off the final titanium sporkful of chocolate chip cookie dough on Tuesday and adding his name to the list of \u201cthru-hikers\u201d who have celebrated the trail's halfway point by downing a half-gallon of ice cream.",
      "By the end Cooper, 32, whose trail name is Pie Top, was calling the experience \u201cpure misery.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't think anybody should be doing this,\u201d Cooper said cheerfully. \u201cThis is not healthy at all.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge is thought to have begun more than four decades ago at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store in Gardners, a few miles north of the current true halfway point on the 2,197-mile (3,536-kilometer) trail. Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",
      "As they slog their way north through Virginia and Maryland, the ice cream challenge is a regular topic of conversation among thru-hikers at shelters and campfires, said Stephan Berens, 49, a psychiatric nurse from Nuremberg, Germany.",
      "Berens, whose trail name is Speedy, polished off his black cherry and vanilla in about 25 minutes after completing 17 miles (27 kilometers) on the trail that day \u2014 and with seven (11 kilometers) more to go that afternoon.",
      "Trail experts say hikers can need up to 6,000 calories a day, a practical challenge when food needs to be carried up and down rocky terrain. The slender Berens figures he's lost about 20 pounds (9 kilograms) since starting April 8.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be worse, but it's OK,\u201d said Berens, smiling and patting his stomach after finishing the half-gallon. \u201cSuch a crazy idea.\u201d",
      "Zeke Meddock, trail name Petroglyph, didn't bother timing himself but finished his choice of a quart and a half carton of chocolate chip cookie dough and a pint of strawberry. The diesel mechanic from North Amarillo, Texas, began his hike on March 27, two months after finishing a stint in the U.S. Army.",
      "\u201cYou're basically walking away from life,\u201d said Meddock, 31. \u201cIt's the most free I've ever felt.\u201d",
      "So far this year, about 50 thru-hikers have finished the challenge, earning the honor of having their photos posted on a store bulletin board. In a notebook to record their thoughts, Chicken Louise wrote on May 24: \u201cLife choices?\u201d The next day, Seagull weighed in with, \u201cI feel bad,\" and Hyena issued a cry for help: \u201cIt was very fun for the first 15 minutes. Now, I (and my family) want to die.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge record, less than 4 minutes, was set two years ago by a man with the trail name Squirt. Two decades ago, the mark to beat was about 9 minutes.",
      "Thru-hikers who want to attempt the record may only allow the $12 worth of ice cream to start to melt in the sun for a few minutes. They must be timed by a store employee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called the half-gallon challenge,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cVery appropriately named.\u201d",
      "Bruce Thomas, a 41-year-old disability support worker from Medicine Hat in Alberta, Canada, passed on the ice cream challenge, opting instead for a breakfast sandwich and another one for the road.",
      "\u201cIt's early morning and I'm pretty sure I cannot do it,\u201d said Thomas, trail name Not Lazy.",
      "Those who do finish in a single sitting are awarded a commemorative wooden spoon \u2014 and bragging rights for the rest of their hike. Some people get sick. Others wash down the ice cream with a hamburger.",
      "The ice cream challenge is one of several quirky traditions and places along the trail. There\u2019s a shelter in Virginia where hikers confess their sins in a logbook, a two-hole outhouse in Maine with a cribbage board between the seats and a free canoe ferry across the Kennebec River that\u2019s considered an official part of the trail. And at Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York, hikers encounter the renowned \u201cLemon Squeezer,\u201d a narrow rock formation.",
      "About one in three people who launch a thru hike take the roughly 5 million steps required to go the distance. They most often walk from south to north, starting in Springer Mountain, Georgia, and wrapping up 13 states later at Maine's Mount Katahdin.",
      "The trek typically takes six months but the current speed record is about 40 days, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Meddock said there's talk that a man on the trail behind him may be on pace to break it.",
      "There's also been a lot of discussion among hikers about the extensive damage along the trail in southern states from September's Hurricane Helene. But mostly they think and talk about walking.",
      "\u201cIt's always hard,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt's going to be hard. I never think about quitting. I only think about how I can do it.\u201d",

They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.",

      "On the other hand, Democrats are more likely to say that \u201ctoo much\u201d is being spent on border security. About half of Democrats now say this, compared with about 3 in 10 in January.",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.",
      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo we\u2019re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,\u201d McMakin said.",
      "Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.",
      "\u201cIt's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve now taken that to send me political texts.\u201d",
      "CVS sent messages to \u201clarge numbers\" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.",
      "Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information \u201cfor their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,\u201d Murrill told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not why anybody gave them their phone number.\u201d",
      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",
      "The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee \u2014 a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.",
      "\u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\u201d Thibault said in an email. \u201cOur communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.",
      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.",
      "\u201cCVS \u2026 you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.",
      "Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.",
      "\u201cYes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,\" Landry said a statement. \"It\u2019s that important.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever. When I found out she was autistic, she\u2019d be outside with knee pads and elbow pads looking crazy.\u201d",
      "He said he later taught his family to be more patient with his daughter, as opposed to traditional parenting styles of being firm and hoping that she would fall in line.",
      "Dr. Berry Pierre said he initially was on the sidelines of his autistic daughter's support team as his wife, Maria Davis-Pierre, did the bulk of advocating.",
      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",
      "\u201cI was very guarded for a while in talking about my children both being on the spectrum,\u201d said Love, who is CEO of the marketing agency The Kulur Group. \u201cEven in how you take pictures that you upload on social media, being cognizant and thinking about, \u2019Well is this a picture that looks, dare I say, the perception of what normal looks like?'\"",
      "Now, he's an open book about them, is understanding when employees need a little extra time for urgent family needs and has advocated that men receive more paid leave so they will have time to be more involved with their kids.",
      "\u201cI got to a point where it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, this is my reality \u2026 I need to do my part in normalizing this,\" Love said.",
      "Green said that while his podcast and platforms like Autism in Black make it easier for Black fathers to share their stories of their kids' wins and losses, he'd like to see \u201cmore support groups out there, more podcasts, more conversations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see a lot of Black women doing their thing and I highly appreciate that, but I think there definitely needs to be more conversations surrounding (Black fatherhood and autism) because, for myself, I\u2019m a Black man,\" Green said. \"I have a Black family, but this is never really the topic of discussion.\u201d",

      "Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias has asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department for allegedly sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois secretary of state on Thursday asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department after learning that it violated state law by sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion.",
      "Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias asked the attorney general to review the matter. He also is creating an audit system to ensure police departments don't run afoul of a 2023 law banning the distribution of license-plate data to track women seeking abortions or to find undocumented immigrants.",
      "The incident underscores the fears that led to the law: In particular, that states which restricted abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned would use the technology to follow and possibly prosecute women seeking the procedure by crossing into Illinois, where it is readily available.",
      "\u201cLicense plate readers can serve as an important tool for law enforcement, but these cameras must be regulated so they aren\u2019t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "According to Giannoulias, police in Mount Prospect, 24 miles (39 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, shared license-plate data with the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, who was looking for a woman whose family was worried because she had undergone a self-administered abortion.",
      "Giannoulias says Mount Prospect also shared data outside of Illinois on undocumented immigrants, in violation of the law. Between mid-January and April, there were 262 searches on immigration-related matters in Mount Prospect alone, he said.",
      "Telephone and email messages were left for Mount Prospect Police Chief Michael Eterno. Violations by Mount Prospect could result in loss of state funding, deputy Secretary of State Scott Burnham said.",
      "The incident was revealed by a website called 404 Media, which reported that the Texas sheriff sent a nationwide request for data from 83,000 cameras operated by the private company Flock Safety, including those in Mount Prospect.",
      "At Giannoulias\u2019 request, Flock Safety blocked access to 62 out-of-state agencies that have sought data related to abortion or immigration, Burnham said. The company also set up a program to flag the terms \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d in requests for access and deny those requests.",
      "Police agencies will also be required to comply with audits by the secretary of state to mark trends or upticks in certain requests, Burnham said.",
      "The Flock Safety cameras take photos of passing license plates thousands of times a day. The technology, called Automatic License Plate Recognition, is helpful in tracking stolen vehicles or carjackings, missing persons and in other authorized cases.",
      "The technology allows police agencies to read thousands of license plates per minute from images captured by cameras along roadways.",
      "After Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, was overturned in 2022, Giannoulias was behind Illinois' first-in-the-nation law that requires other states wanting access to Illinois license-plate data to agree not to use it for that purpose or to track undocumented immigrants.",

      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",
      "Decades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 to terminate pregnancies.",
      "But it wasn't until 2023 that telehealth abortions across states became more popular, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "The Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",
      "Pills can arrive in a less than a week.",
      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",
      "Julie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won\u2019t be \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d into ceasing operations.",

      "A doctor who is part of A Safe Choice, a network of California-based physicians that prescribes abortion pills to women in all 50 states, told The Associated Press he believes he is protected by the state's shield law, but is also taking precautions.",

      "The U.S. is up to 1,197 confirmed measles cases this year",
      "The U.S. logged fewer than 30 measles cases this week as Ohio health officials confirmed three outbreaks in two counties were over.",
      "There have been 1,197 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health officials in Texas, where the nation's biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed two cases in the last week.",
      "There are three other major outbreaks in North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 2,083 cases from mid-October through June 10. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.",
      "Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened 868 as of Thursday. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 2,179 measles cases and four deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.",
      "Other U.S. states with active outbreaks \u2014 which the CDC defines as three or more related cases \u2014 include Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma.",
      "In the U.S., two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles this year. All were unvaccinated.",
      "Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that\u2019s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.",
      "There are a total of 744 cases across 35 counties, most of them in West Texas, state health officials said Tuesday.",
      "Throughout the outbreak, 96 people have been hospitalized.",
      "State health officials estimated less than 1% of cases \u2014 fewer than 10 \u2014 are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas\u2019 cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 411 cases since late January \u2014 just under 2% of the county\u2019s residents.",
      "The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of \u201cwhat the child\u2019s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.\u201d A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.",
      "New Mexico held steady Friday with a total of 81 cases.",
      "Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state\u2019s cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Don\u0303a Ana County has two. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.",
      "An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.",
      "Oklahoma stayed steady Friday with a total of 16 confirmed and three probable cases.",
      "The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.",
      "Arizona has four cases in Navajo County. They are linked to a single source, the county health department said Monday. All four were unvaccinated and had a history of recent international travel.",
      "Colorado has seen a total of 14 measles cases in 2025, which includes one outbreak of eight related cases.",
      "The outbreak is linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May, and includes four cases in Arapahoe County, three in El Paso County and one in Denver, plus a person who doesn't live in Colorado.",
      "Other counties that have seen measles this year include Archuleta and Pueblo.",
      "Illinois health officials confirmed a four-case outbreak on May 5 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to eight cases as of June 6, but no new cases were reported in the following week, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.",
      "The state's other two cases so far this year were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.",
      "Kansas has a total of 76 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with three hospitalizations. All but two of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.",
      "Montana had 20 measles cases as of Tuesday. Twelve were in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up \u2014 Montana\u2019s first in 35 years.",
      "Flathead and Yellowstone counties had two cases each, and Hill County had four cases.",
      "There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.",
      "North Dakota, which hadn't seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of June 6, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized, and all of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.",
      "There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.",
      "Measles cases also have been reported this year in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.",
      "Earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania were declared over by health officials after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee\u2019s outbreak also appears to be over.",
      "Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year, and most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\"",
      "Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 due to \u201cherd immunity.\u201d But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",

      "A British police force has apologized to the family of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn who was killed by a U.S. government employee driving on the wrong side of the road",
      "LONDON -- A British police force apologized Wednesday to the family of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn who was killed by an American government employee driving on the wrong side of the road near a U.S. airbase.",
      "In a statement following the publication of a review into the incident, Northamptonshire Police apologized to Dunn's family for \u201ca failure on our part to do the very best for the victim in this case.\u201d",
      "The review criticized the police force, specifically former chief constable Nick Adderley, for the way the investigation was handled and said priority was given to the welfare of the suspect, Anne Sacoolas, over a \u201cprompt and effective investigation.\"",
      "It also and found that there is potentially a culture at Northamptonshire Police of not arresting suspects \u201cin circumstances such as these, which could lead to evidence not being obtained.\u201d",
      "Reacting to the review, Harry\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, said the failures identified were something \u201cno family should ever have to endure.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s review report confirms what we have known for years, that we were failed by the very people we should have been able to trust,\u201d she said. \u201cHarry was left to die on the roadside. Sacoolas was not arrested, even though the police had every power to do so. She fled the country, and they didn\u2019t tell us\u201d",
      "Sacoolas was driving on the wrong side of the road when her car struck and killed 19-year-old Dunn near U.S. military base RAF Croughton. Unlike in the U.S., drivers in the U.K. drive on the left-hand side of the road.",
      "Sacoolas and her husband, an American intelligence officer, were able to leave the U.K. under diplomatic immunity laws 19 days after the crash in August 2019. The U.S. government had invoked diplomatic immunity on her behalf, prompting an outcry in Britain.",
      "She admitted to police two months after the accident that she \u201cdrove like an American.\" She was given an eight-month suspended prison sentence in December 2022, though she declined to come to Britain for the court hearing. The judge in the case reduced the penalty because of Sacoolas\u2019 guilty plea and previous good character.",
      "A year ago, a British coroner criticized the U.S. government over a lack of training for its diplomatic personnel at the conclusion of the inquest",
      "Sacoolas, who told police that she worked as an analyst for the U.S. State Department, declined to make the journey to the U.K. from the U.S. for last year's inquest. She has said she made a \u201ctragic mistake\u201d and has apologized for the \u201cpain that I have caused.\u201d",

      "Fans in Greece are paying their respects to clarinetist Petroloukas Chalkias, whose hypnotic, note-bending performances over the course of seven decades made him a hero of mountain folk music",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Greece is honoring the late clarinetist Petroloukas Chalkias, whose hypnotic, note-bending performances over the course of more than 70 years made him a hero of mountain folk music.",
      "Chalkias, who died at 90 over the weekend, lay in state Wednesday at the Athens Cathedral \u2014 a rare honor typically reserved for prime ministers and religious leaders.",
      "As pallbearers emerged through the doors in a chapel next to the cathedral, carrying the coffin, silence descended. Mourners then clapped and shouted \u201cimmortal\u201d as musicians played folk tunes. It was a solemn prelude to his funeral which will take place in the rugged highlands of Epirus, in northwest Greece, where he first took up the clarinet as a boy of 11.",
      "Greek President Constantine Tassoulas earlier this week described Chalkias as a \u201clegendary figure.\u201d",
      "Epirus\u2019 folk music, slowly unfolding and often centered around the clarinet, is steeped in improvisation, with its wanderings inviting comparisons to rural blues and jazz. It\u2019s one of the reasons that, while not so distinguished as a recording artist, Chalkias\u2019 live performances made him a household name for Greeks young and old alike.",
      "His style evolved after settling in New York as a young man, joining a wave of musicians who emigrated along with other Greeks to escape the hardship of postwar poverty. Chalkias found an unlikely second stage: dimly-lit clubs filled with Greek emigres and curious outsiders. Among those drawn to his performances were jazz legends Benny Goodman and Louis Armstrong.",
      "Musicians paying their respects on Wednesday praised Chalkias for his generosity with his time in helping fellow artists. \u201cI was a young woman when I started out and I was incredibly lucky to have him support me,\u201d folk singer Giota Griva said. \u201cHis influence was immense. He was an artist who will never leave us.\u201d",
      "Born Petros Loukas Chalkias, the musician was the son and grandson of clarinet players. He was raised with the region\u2019s rich tradition of live music \u2014 an essential part of village festivals, celebrations, and mourning rituals.",
      "Discouraged at first by a family wary of the musician\u2019s path, the young Chalkias fashioned his own makeshift clarinet from a hollow reed, carving its finger holes. By his early teens, his playing \u2014 raw and instinctive, but undeniably gifted \u2014 was good enough to earn him a spot on national radio.",
      "Chalkias spent nearly 20 years in the US and raised a family there, but said he always intended to return to Greece. He did so in 1979, performing live across the country and reconnecting with Delvinaki, the red-roofed mountain village of his birth near Greece\u2019s border with Albania.",
      "Delvinaki bore deep scars from the devastations of World War II and the civil war that followed. Chalkias, like many of his generation, grew up with interrupted schooling and little formal training. His music was learned by ear and memory, and never performed using sheet music.",
      "\u201cIn the hearts of all Greeks, he stands as the foremost ambassador of our folk song tradition,\u201d President Tassoulas, also from Epirus, said in a statement. \u201cThough Petros Loukas Chalkias has departed this life, his voice has not fallen silent \u2013- nor will it ever.\u201d",
      "Chalkias died in Athens. His family did not announce the cause of his death. His funeral will be held at the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Delvinaki on Thursday.",
      "He is survived by a son and a daughter.",

      "YEREVAN, Armenia -- One of richest men in Armenia has been arrested on charges of making public calls to seize power in the country illegally, his lawyer said Wednesday, as a feud between Armenia\u2019s prime minister and the nation's dominant church intensified.",
      "Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has long had a tumultuous relationship with the Armenian Apostolic Church and billionaire Samvel Karapetyan now seems to have been caught up in it.",
      "Karapetyan, 59, was detained late on Tuesday night and appeared in front of a court in the Armenian capital of Yerevan on Wednesday, according to Armen Feroyan, his attorney.",
      "The lawyer said Karapetyan denied the charges against him. Karapetyan, who also holds Russian citizenship, owns the Tashir Group, a conglomerate that operates residential and commercial real estate as well as the Electric Networks of Armenia.",
      "Pashinyan, the prime minister, told journalists on Wednesday that the power company would be nationalized \u201csoon\u201d following Karapetyan\u2019s arrest.",

      "\u201cI have always stood with the Armenian Church and the Armenian people,\u201d the billionaire said. \"If the politicians do not succeed, we will intervene in our own way in this campaign against the church.\u201d",
      "The remarks were seen as a jab at Pashinyan, who on June 8 called for the head of Armenia\u2019s church, Catholicos Karekin II, to resign after accusing him of fathering a child while under a vow of celibacy. At the time, the church released a statement accusing Pashinyan of undermining Armenia's \u201cspiritual unity\u201d but did not address the claim about the child.",
      "Pashinyan responded, promising on Facebook to crack down on \u201cdepraved\u201d members of the clergy and their benefactors.",
      "\u201cHe says \u2018we will intervene in our own way\u2019,\u201d Pashinyan wrote, apparently citing Karapetyan. \u201cNow I will intervene in my own way.\u201d",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, the prime minister dismissed the head of the country\u2019s national security service, Armen Abazyan. When asked by journalists if the move was linked to the billionaire's arrest, Pashinyan only said the security chief \u201cdeserved to rest a little\u201d after a difficult tenure.",

      "MILAN -- The British superyacht that sank off Sicily last August killing seven is scheduled to be lifted from the seabed this weekend, after the removal of its 72-meter (236-foot) mast, the salvage company heading the operation said Wednesday.",
      "The cutting down of the Bayesian's mast allowed the hull to be brought to a nearly upright position, accelerating the recovery schedule by about a week.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "The vessel is to be lifted from a depth of 50 meters (164 feet) by a powerful maritime floating crane barge on Saturday, weather permitting, and is expected to be brought to port on Monday, TMC Marine said in a statement. The mast, meanwhile, was left on the seabed for future removal.",
      "Lifting the 56-meter (184-foot) Bayesian requires the installation of eight main steel lifting straps, along with four previously installed, the company said.",
      "During the recent operations, salvage crews removed a life raft and deck furniture, which were brought to the port. TMC has previously recovered suspected debris from the seabed using a remote-controlled submersible.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, but the operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later. A new recovery plan was approved last week.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. Fifteen people survived. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Erick has formed in the eastern Pacific on a forecast track where it could make landfall in Mexico",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Hurricane Erick formed Wednesday in the Pacific Ocean on a forecast track to bring heavy rain, strong winds, storm surge and possible mudslides to southern coastal Mexico, forecasters said.",
      "Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lighter amounts in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain.",
      "The Category 1 storm on Wednesday morning was located about 160 miles (257 kilometers) south-southeast of Puerto \u00c1ngel, Mexico, and had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (121 kph). It was moving northwest at 7 mph (11 kph).",
      "Erick is expected to be at or near major hurricane status Thursday as it approaches the Mexican coast on Thursday, where it could make landfall. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher and wind speeds of 111-129 mph (180-210 kph).",
      "The storm\u2019s projected path would take its center near the resort of Acapulco, which was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared.",
      "At least 52 people died in Otis and 32 were missing, after the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort\u2019s hotels.",
      "Guerrero state Gov. Evelyn Salgado said Tuesday that lessons were learned from that storm. She said all schools in the state would close Wednesday and said 582 shelters were prepared to receive people who might evacuate their homes.",
      "A hurricane warning was in effect for Acapulco to Puerto \u00c1ngel. A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected in the area, and preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, according to the hurricane center advisory.",
      "Heavy rainfall up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) was forecast for parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with as much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) set to fall in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states.",

      "NEW YORK -- The streets of Tehran are empty, businesses closed, communications patchy at best. With no bona fide bomb shelters open to the public, panicked masses spend restless nights on the floors of metro stations as strikes boom overhead.",
      "This is Iran\u2019s capital city, just under a week into a fierce Israeli blitz to destroy the country's nuclear program and its military capabilities. After knocking out much of Iran's air defense system, Israel says its warplanes have free rein over the city's skies. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday told Tehran's roughly 10 million residents to evacuate \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "Thousands have fled, spending hours in gridlock as they head toward the suburbs, the Caspian Sea, or even Armenia or Turkey. But others \u2014 those elderly and infirm \u2014 are stuck in high-rise apartment buildings. Their relatives fret: what to do?",
      "Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 585 people and wounded over 1,300, a human rights group says. Local media, themselves targets of bombardment, have stopped reporting on the attacks, leaving Iranians in the dark. There are few visible signs of state authority: Police appear largely undercover, air raid sirens are unreliable, and there\u2019s scant information on what to do in case of attack.",
      "Shirin, 49, who lives in the southern part of Tehran, said every call or text to friends and family in recent days has felt like it could be the last.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if tomorrow we will be alive,\u201d she said.",
      "Many Iranians feel conflicted. Some support Israel's targeting of Iranian political and military officials they see as repressive. Others staunchly defend the Islamic Republic and retaliatory strikes on Israel. Then, there are those who oppose Iran\u2019s rulers \u2014 but still don't want to see their country bombed.",
      "The Associated Press interviewed five people in Iran and one Iranian American in the U.S. over the phone. All spoke either on the condition of anonymity or only allowed their first names to be used, for fear of retribution from the state against them or their families.",
      "Most of the calls ended abruptly and within minutes, cutting off conversations as people grew nervous \u2014 or because the connection dropped. Iran\u2019s government has acknowledged disrupting internet access. It says it's to protect the country, though that has blocked average Iranians from getting information from the outside world.",
      "Iranians in the diaspora wait anxiously for news from relatives. One, an Iranian American human rights researcher in the U.S., said he last heard from relatives when some were trying to flee Tehran earlier in the week. He believes that lack of gas and traffic prevented them from leaving.",
      "The most heartbreaking interaction, he said, was when his older cousins \u2014 with whom he grew up in Iran \u2014 told him \u201cwe don\u2019t know where to go. If we die, we die.\u201d",
      "\u201cTheir sense was just despair,\u201d he said.",
      "Some families have made the decision to split up.",
      "A 23-year-old Afghan refugee who has lived in Iran for four years said he stayed behind in Tehran but sent his wife and newborn son out of the city after a strike Monday hit a nearby pharmacy.",
      "\u201cIt was a very bad shock for them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some, like Shirin, said fleeing was not an option. The apartment buildings in Tehran are towering and dense. Her father has Alzheimer\u2019s and needs an ambulance to move. Her mother's severe arthritis would make even a short trip extremely painful.",
      "Still, hoping escape might be possible, she spent the last several days trying to gather their medications. Her brother waited at a gas station until 3 a.m., only to be turned away when the fuel ran out. As of Monday, gas was being rationed to under 20 liters (5 gallons) per driver at stations across Iran after an Israeli strike set fire to the world's largest gas field.",
      "Some people, like Arshia, said they are just tired.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to go in traffic for 40 hours, 30 hours, 20 hours, just to get to somewhere that might get bombed eventually,\u201d he said.",
      "The 22-year-old has been staying in the house with his parents since the initial Israeli strike. He said his once-lively neighborhood of Saadat Abad in northwestern Tehran is now a ghost town. Schools are closed. Very few people even step outside to walk their dogs. Most local stores have run out of drinking water and cooking oil. Others closed.",
      "Still, Arshia said the prospect of finding a new place is too daunting.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources to leave at the moment,\u201d he said.",
      "No air raid sirens went off as Israeli strikes began pounding Tehran before dawn Friday. For many, it was an early sign civilians would have to go it alone.",
      "During the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, Tehran was a low-slung city, many homes had basements to shelter in, and there were air raid drills and sirens. Now the capital is packed with close-built high-rise apartments without shelters.",
      "\u201cIt's a kind of failing of the past that they didn\u2019t build shelters,\u201d said a 29-year-old Tehran resident who left the city Monday. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve been under the shadow of a war, as long as I can remember.\u201d",
      "Her friend's boyfriend was killed while going to the store.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really expect your boyfriend \u2014 or your anyone, really \u2014 to leave the house and never return when they just went out for a routine normal shopping trip,\u201d she said.",
      "Those who choose to relocate do so without help from the government. The state has said it is opening mosques, schools and metro stations for use as shelters. Some are closed, others overcrowded.",
      "Hundreds crammed into one Tehran metro station Friday night. Small family groups lay on the floor. One student, a refugee from another country, said she spent 12 hours in the station with her relatives.",
      "\u201cEveryone there was panicking because of the situation,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone doesn\u2019t know what will happen next, if there is war in the future and what they should do. People think nowhere is safe for them.\u201d",
      "Soon after leaving the station, she saw that Israel had warned a swath of Tehran to evacuate.",
      "\u201cFor immigrant communities, this is so hard to live in this kind of situation,\u201d she said, explaining she feels like she has nowhere to escape to \u2014 especially not her home country, which she asked not be identified.",
      "For Shirin, the hostilities are bittersweet. Despite being against the theocracy and its treatment of women, the idea that Israel may determine the future does not sit well with her.",
      "\u201cAs much as we want the end of this regime, we didn\u2019t want it to come at the hands of a foreign government,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would have preferred that if there were to be a change, it would be the result of a people\u2019s movement in Iran.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the 29-year-old who left Tehran had an even more basic message for those outside Iran:",
      "\u201cI just want people to remember that whatever is happening here, it\u2019s not routine business for us. People\u2019s lives here \u2014 people\u2019s livelihoods \u2014 feel as important to them as they feel to anyone in any other place. How would you feel if your city or your country was under bombardment by another country, and people were dying left and right?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are kind of like, this can\u2019t be happening. This can\u2019t be my life.\u201d",

      "Both sides have said they acted in self-defense. One Cambodian soldier was killed.",
      "While the countries said afterwards they have agreed to de-escalate the situation, Cambodian and Thai authorities continue to implement or threaten measures short of armed force at each other, keeping tensions high.",
      "Thailand has added restrictions at the border such as limiting crossing times and barring Thai casino tourists and workers from crossing into Cambodia.",
      "Cambodia has banned Thai movies and TV shows, stopped the import of Thai fruits and vegetables and boycotted its neighbor's international internet links and power supply.",
      "Border disputes are long-standing issues that have caused periodic tensions between the two neighbors. Thailand and Cambodia share more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) of land border.",
      "The contesting claims stem largely from a 1907 map drawn under French colonial rule that was used to separate Cambodia from Thailand.",
      "Cambodia has been using the map as a reference to claim territory, while Thailand has argued the map is inaccurate.",
      "In February, Cambodian troops and their family members entered an ancient temple along the border in one of the disputed areas and sang the Cambodian national anthem, leading to a brief argument with Thai troops.",
      "The most prominent and violent conflicts broke out around the 1,000-year-old Preah Vihear temple.",
      "In 1962, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) awarded sovereignty over the area to Cambodia and that became a major irritant in relations.",
      "Cambodia went back to the court in 2011, following several clashes between its army and Thai forces which killed about 20 and displaced thousands of people. The court reaffirmed the ruling in 2013, a decision that still rattled Thailand.",
      "Similar to the Phear Vihear area, Cambodia is seeking a ruling again from the ICJ over several disputed areas, including where the deadly clash happened.",
      "Thailand has said it doesn\u2019t accept the jurisdiction of the ICJ and that any conflicting border claims between the two should be solved by the existing bilateral mechanism, including a joint committee which was established in 2000 as a technical means to discuss the survey and demarcation of the land border.",
      "Cambodia nevertheless said it has submitted the case to the ICJ, and insisted that it would no longer discuss these areas under the two countries' bilateral mechanism.",
      "Tensions have soared as they engaged in a war of words that appeared intended to mollify nationalistic critics on both sides of the border.",
      "The ill feeling between the two neighbors is not just about overlapping border claims, but also deep-seated cultural enmity that has its roots from centuries ago, when they were large and competing empires.",
      "In more modern times, bad feelings have lingered, as Cambodia\u2019s development, hindered by French colonialism and, in the 1970s, the brutal rule of the communist Khmer Rouge, has fallen well behind Thailand.",
      "Both have fought over claims on cultural products ranging from boxing, mask dancing, traditional clothing and food.",

      "\u201cWe have successfully arrested three suspects last night,\u201d Bali Police Chief Daniel Adityajaya told reporters in Denpasar, the provincial capital.",
      "\u201cThe three suspects are Australian men and they are now being held and questioned for further investigation,\u201d he said.",
      "Zivan Radmanovic, a 32-year-old from Melbourne, was killed just after midnight on June 13 at a villa near Munggu Beach in Bali\u2019s Badung district. A second man, a 34-year-old from Melbourne, was left beaten in the attack.",
      "Police earlier said they had detained two suspects, but further investigation led police to arrest a third man who helped them to prepare the killing, Adityajaya said.",
      "Witnesses at the villa told investigators that two gunmen arrived on a scooter at the villa around midnight.",
      "Radmanovic was shot in a bathroom of his room, where police found 17 bullet casings and two intact bullets.",
      "Radmanovic\u2019s wife, Gourdeas Jazmyn, 30, told police that she suddenly woke up when she heard her husband screaming. She cowered under a blanket when she heard multiple gunshots.",
      "She later found her husband\u2019s body and the other injured Australian, whose wife also testified to seeing the attackers.",
      "Adityajaya said based on the facts and evidences collected by police on the ground, \u201cWe have confidence that the three (suspects) are the perpetrators.\u201d",
      "Two of the men were arrested late Tuesday in Singapore and at Jakarta's Soekarno Hatta International Airport, while trying to flee. Indonesian police didn\u2019t say where the third suspect was apprehended.",

      "He said police are still investigating the motive and how they got the weapon as firearm ownership and use are heavily regulated in Indonesia.",
      "\u201cWe are still investigating the possibility of other suspects,\u201d Adityajaya said.",
      "He praised the collaboration between Indonesian police and immigration agencies in tracking the whereabouts of the suspects with the support of the Australian Federal Police and Interpol in the Southeast Asia region.",

    "story": [
      "In Gaza and Africa, U.S. contracting firms led by former American intelligence and military officers are taking on aid delivery in conflict zones",
      "ON A PLANE OVER UPPER NILE STATE, South Sudan -- Swooping low over the banks of a Nile River tributary, an aid flight run by retired American military officers released a stream of food-stuffed sacks over a town emptied by fighting in South Sudan, a country wracked by conflict.",
      "Last week's air drop was the latest in a controversial development \u2014 private contracting firms led by former U.S. intelligence officers and military veterans delivering aid to some of the world's deadliest conflict zones, in operations organized with governments that are combatants in the conflicts.",
      "The moves are roiling the global aid community, which warns of a more militarized, politicized and profit-seeking trend that could allow governments or combatants to use life-saving aid to control hungry civilian populations and advance war aims.",
      "In South Sudan and Gaza, two for-profit U.S. companies led by American national security veterans are delivering aid in operations backed by the South Sudanese and Israeli governments.",
      "The American contractors say they're putting their security, logistics and intelligence skills to work in relief operations. Fogbow, the U.S. company that carried out last week's air drops over South Sudan, says it aims to be a \u201chumanitarian\u201d force.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked for careers, collectively, in conflict zones. And we know how to essentially make very difficult situations work,\u201d said Fogbow President Michael Mulroy, a retired CIA officer and former senior defense official in the first Trump administration, speaking on the airport tarmac in Juba, South Sudan's capital.",
      "But the U.N. and many leading non-profit groups say U.S. contracting firms are stepping into aid distribution with little transparency or humanitarian experience, and, crucially, without commitment to humanitarian principles of neutrality and operational independence in war zones.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned over the years of successes and failures is there\u2019s a difference between a logistics operation and a security operation, and a humanitarian operation,\u201d said Scott Paul, a director at Oxfam America.",
      "\u201c\u2018Truck and chuck\u2019 doesn\u2019t help people,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt puts people at risk.\u201d",
      "Fogbow took journalists up in a cargo plane to watch their team drop 16 tons of beans, corn and salt for South Sudan's Upper Nile state town of Nasir.",
      "Residents fled homes there after fighting erupted in March between the government and opposition groups.",
      "Mulroy acknowledged the controversy over Fogbow's aid drops, which he said were paid for by the South Sudanese government.",
      "But, he maintained: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to replace any entity\u201d in aid work.",
      "Fogbow was in the spotlight last year for its proposal to use barges to bring aid to Gaza, where Israeli restrictions were blocking overland deliveries. The United States focused instead on a U.S. military effort to land aid via a temporary pier.",
      "Since then, Fogbow has carried out aid drops in Sudan and South Sudan, east African nations where wars have created some of the world's gravest humanitarian crises.",
      "Fogbow says ex-humanitarian officials are also involved, including former U.N. World Food Program head David Beasley, who is a senior adviser.",
      "Operating in Gaza, meanwhile, Safe Reach Solutions, led by a former CIA officer and other retired U.S. security officers, has partnered with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed nonprofit that Israel says is the linchpin of a new aid system to wrest control from the U.N., which Israel says has been infiltrated by Hamas, and other humanitarian groups.",
      "Starting in late May, the American-led operation in Gaza has distributed food at fixed sites in southern Gaza, in line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's stated plan to use aid to concentrate the territory's more than 2 million people in the south, freeing Israel to fight Hamas elsewhere. Aid workers fear it's a step toward another of Netanyahu\u2019s public goals, removing Palestinians from Gaza in \u201cvoluntary\u201d migrations.",
      "Since then, several hundred Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded in near daily shootings as they tried to reach aid sites, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Witnesses say Israeli troops regularly fire heavy barrages toward the crowds in an attempt to control them.",
      "The Israeli military has denied firing on civilians. It says it fired warning shots in several instances, and fired directly at a few \u201csuspects\u201d who ignored warnings and approached its forces.",
      "It\u2019s unclear who is funding the new operation in Gaza. No donor has come forward, and the U.S. says it\u2019s not funding it.",
      "In response to criticism over its Gaza aid deliveries, Safe Reach Solutions said it has former aid workers on its team with \u201cdecades of experience in the world\u2019s most complex environments\u201d who bring \"expertise to the table, along with logisticians and other experts.\u201c",
      "Last week's air drop over South Sudan went without incident, despite fighting nearby. A white cross marked the drop zone. Only a few people could be seen. Fogbow contractors said there were more newly returned townspeople on previous drops.",
      "Fogbow acknowledges glitches in mastering aid drops, including one last year in Sudan\u2019s South Kordofan region that ended up with too-thinly-wrapped grain sacks split open on the ground.",
      "After gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan has struggled to emerge from a civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people. Rights groups say its government is one of the world\u2019s most corrupt, and until now has invested little in quelling the dire humanitarian crisis.",
      "South Sudan said it engaged Fogbow for air drops partly because of the Trump administration\u2019s deep cuts in U.S. Agency for International Development funding. Humanitarian Minister Albino Akol Atak said the drops will expand to help people in need throughout the country.",
      "But two South Sudanese groups question the government's motives.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see a humanitarian space being abused by military actors ... under the cover of a food drop,\" said Edmund Yakani, head of the Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, a local civil society group.",
      "Asked about suspicions the aid drops were helping South Sudan's military aims, Fogbow's Mulroy said the group has worked with the U.N. World Food Program to make sure \u201cthis aid is going to civilians.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it wasn't going to civilians, we would hope that we would get that feedback, and we would cease and desist,\u201d Mulroy said.",
      "In a statement, WFP country director Mary-Ellen McGroarty said: \u201cWFP is not involved in the planning, targeting or distribution of food air-dropped\u201d by Fogbow on behalf of South Sudan's government, citing humanitarian principles.",
      "Longtime humanitarian leaders and analysts are troubled by what they see as a teaming up of warring governments and for-profit contractors in aid distribution.",
      "When one side in a conflict decides where and how aid is handed out, and who gets it, \u201cit will always result in some communities getting preferential treatment,\u201d said Jan Egeland, executive director of the Norwegian Refugee Council.",
      "Sometimes, that set-up will advance strategic aims, as with Netanyahu's plans to move Gaza's civilians south, Egeland said.",
      "The involvement of soldiers and security workers, he added, can make it too \u201cintimidating\u201d for some in need to even try to get aid.",
      "Until now, Western donors always understood those risks, Egeland said. But pointing to the Trump administration's backing of the new aid system in Gaza, he asked: \u201cWhy does the U.S. ... want to support what they have resisted with every other war zone for two generations?\u201d",
      "Mark Millar, who has advised the U.N. and Britain on humanitarian matters in South Sudan and elsewhere, said involving private military contractors risks undermining the distinction between humanitarian assistance and armed conflict.",
      "Private military contractors \u201chave even less sympathy for a humanitarian perspective that complicates their business-driven model,\" he said. \u201cAnd once let loose, they seem to be even less accountable.\u201d",

      "MEXICO CITY -- For Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, the bilateral meetings scheduled on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada Tuesday were even more important than the summit itself and her first face-to-face dialogue with U.S. President Donald Trump was to headline her trip.",
      "But Trump\u2019s decision to return to Washington early left a gaping hole in Mexico\u2019s schedule and delayed a much anticipated encounter. Sheinbaum had been expected to continue making the case for Mexican strides in security and immigration, while negotiating to lift steel and aluminum tariffs and lobbying to kill a proposed tax on money Mexicans in the U.S. send home.",
      "Sheinbaum said on X Tuesday that she had spoken with Trump by phone who explained that he had to return to Washington to stay on top of the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict. \u201cWe agreed to work together to soon reach an agreement on various issues that concern us today,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Sheinbaum was not the only world leader stood up by Trump, but she has developed one of the more intriguing relationships with the unpredictable U.S. president.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s success at managing the bilateral relationship has been such that some began to wonder aloud if she was a Trump whisperer. Most significantly, she has avoided two tariff threats that could have been devastating to Mexico\u2019s economy.",
      "She has done it by affording Trump the respect any U.S. president would expect from their neighbor, deploying occasional humor and pushing back \u2014 respectfully \u2014 when necessary.",
      "Jorge Alberto Schiavon Uriegas, a professor in the International Studies department at Mexico's Iberoamerican University, said the first Trump meeting was setting up well for Sheinbaum because it was on neutral territory and it was closed door, unlike some recent Oval Office meetings that have gone poorly for leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "\u201cIt would allow them to advance privately the bilateral agenda or better said, (advance) diplomatically without lights, the main issues of the bilateral agenda,\u201d Schiavon Uriegas said.",
      "The agenda remains largely unchanged, but with a rearrangement of priorities for both countries.",
      "The decline in cross-border migration has removed the issue from the top agenda for the first time in years.",
      "On security, Sheinbaum has blunted some of the Trump administration\u2019s tough talk on fentanyl and organized crime by more actively pursuing drug cartels.",
      "In February, Mexico sent more than two dozen drug cartel figures to the U.S., including Rafael Caro Quintero, long sought in the 1985 killing of a DEA agent. That show of goodwill, and a much more visible effort against fentanyl production, has garnered a positive response from the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cI think there is going to be greater (security) cooperation now...greater than ever,\u201d U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau told reporters Monday, after returning from a visit with Sheinbaum.",
      "The threat to remittance income, whether through a proposed tax or increased deportations, is real for Mexico. Nearly $65 billion was sent home to Mexico last year, so it was news earlier this month when Mexico reported that remittances were down 12% in April compared with the same month last year, the largest drop in more than a decade. Sheinbaum suggested it could be related to Trump administration immigration policies.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s attendance alone signals an important prioritization of foreign policy for Mexico after six years in which her predecessor, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, repeatedly skipped multilateral gatherings like the G7.",
      "\u201cIt allows Mexico to reposition itself in the most important spaces of dialogue and coordination at a global level,\u201d Schiavon Uriegas said.",
      "Michael Shifter, adjunct professor of Latin American Politics at Georgetown University, said that while the canceled Trump meeting was a loss, Sheinbaum\u2019s other bilateral meetings with leaders from India, Germany and Canada should not be discounted.",
      "\u201cMexico is in a moment of looking for and diversifying allies,\" Shifter said.",
      "Still, an in-person Trump meeting \u2014 whenever it happens \u2014 will be key for Sheinbaum. While her top Cabinet secretaries have made numerous trips to Washington to discuss security and trade with their U.S. counterparts, Trump is the one who counts.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s only one person who makes decisions here,\u201d Shifter said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be sure and trust in anything until President Trump decides.\u201d",

      "An Associated Press journalist saw the officer, who had concealed his face with a mask, shoot the unarmed man at close range with what appeared to be a shotgun. The man, who had been holding a packet of face masks, was believed to be a vendor caught up in a confrontation with two officers while standing on a Nairobi sidewalk.

      "VIENNA -- A former student who killed nine students and a teacher in Austria a week ago and then took his own life had become fascinated with school shootings in recent years, but his motive for the rampage remains unclear, investigators said Tuesday.",
      "Police have said the 21-year-old gunman planned last Tuesday's roughly seven-minute attack at the BORG Dreiersch\u00fctzengasse high school in Graz, which he left three years ago, down to the smallest detail. But much remains uncertain: among other things, why he chose that particular date and why he stopped shooting when he did.",
      "After his body was found, investigators found that the shooter still had 24 bullets in two magazines and another 18 loose bullets for his Glock handgun, as well as 17 bullets for his shotgun, said Michael Lohnegger, the head of Styria province\u2019s criminal police office.",
      "A few minutes before the shooting began, the gunman took a picture showing his legs and boots in a school bathroom and posted it to a social media account, Lohnegger said. Investigators are still working through some 30 other accounts attributed to him, created between 2019 and this year, to determine which are genuine.",
      "They can \u201csay with certainty that, over the years, he developed a significant passion in general terms for the phenomenon of school shootings,\u201d Lohnegger said. \u201cHe glorifies not just the acts in general, but also the perpetrators who carried out these acts.\"",
      "However, he said, police still have no information on his motive for the shooting.",
      "Eleven people were wounded last week. As of Tuesday, two had been released from hospitals but nine were still being treated, two of whom were still in intensive care, Lohnegger said. Their lives were not in danger.",
      "Chancellor Christian Stocker said Monday that Austria will tighten its gun laws, which are among the more liberal in the European Union. The gunman owned the two firearms he used legally.",

      "ROME -- An 80-year-old man drove a compact luxury Mercedes-Benz A Class sedan down the landmark Spanish Steps in Rome early on Tuesday before getting stuck part way down, municipal police said in a statement.",
      "The man tested negative for alcohol, and was cited on the spot for driving down the monument in Rome\u2019s historic center, police said. Police did not identify the driver or say if the car was his. They also did not say whether or not he was using a navigator.",
      "The small sporty car was later removed by firefighters using a crane. Police did not respond to requests for more details about the dynamics of the apparent accident.",
      "One of Rome's most recognizable monuments, the Spanish Steps have never been intended for motor vehicles, although some thrill seekers have tried their luck. A Saudi man was charged with aggravated damage to cultural heritage after a surveillance camera recorded him driving a rented Maserati down the 135 travertine steps in 2022.",
      "The Spanish Steps take their name from the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See in the nearby square. A famed background for numerous films, they were built in the 1720s and have long been a popular spot to people watch and hang out.",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- The latest addition to the Copenhagen skyline is a tall, 12-sided wooden building proudly bearing the sign \u201cDenmark\u2019s First Tiny Church.\u201d",
      "The 76-square-meter (818-square-foot) construction was unveiled Sunday in the Nordhavn \u2014 \u201cNorth Harbor\u201d \u2014 district on the outskirts of Copenhagen. After months of construction, it's now an outpost of the local Evangelical-Lutheran Hans Egedes Church.",
      "The parish's leaders saw a need for extra spiritual space as the Danish capital is expected to grow by 20% over the next decade. In Nordhavn alone, the former fishing port is already seeing an influx of new housing projects, bringing with them an estimated 40,000 new residents over the next four decades.",
      "\u201cAt the old days, you build a church, and the church will make a community, and then you build the city. Today, it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d project manager Johanne Dal-Lewkovitch said. \u201cYou build the city, and then there\u2019s a need for a church. So it\u2019s a little bit strange.\u201d",
      "In Denmark, a nation of 6 million people, more than 70% of the population are registered members of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church, but few Danes go to church on a regular basis. In fact, many go just once a year, on Christmas Eve.",
      "But this tiny church is expected to be popular for weddings, baptisms, funerals and other more intimate services because of its cozy interior. Only 40 to 50 people can fit inside its 12 walls \u2014 one wall for each apostle \u2014 beneath a skylight.",
      "\u201cOne of the important things is that we also are different compared to other churches,\u201d parish priest Christian Bro said. \u201cHere, we have a very, very small church and that creates a different room, another feeling.\u201d",
      "Sunday's opening featured an outdoor church service, choral concert and communal dining.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the first in maybe a new modern church world, you can say,\u201d Bro said.",
      "The \u201cTiny Church\u201d concept was first seen in Amsterdam suburb Almere Poort, where Dutch church leaders saw the need for a new location where believers could meet, talk and worship together.",
      "Echoing early Viking churches once seen across this Scandinavian nation, the new church is built almost entirely from wood, including recycled timber donated by a local flooring factory. It\u2019s insulated with newspapers, and the interior has been painted white to match the matte white rock surfaces seen in more traditional Danish churches.",
      "While its home is in Nordhavn for now, its metal stilts mean that it can be easily picked up and moved elsewhere.",
      "It can be \u201cput it up some other place where there\u2019s another need in another parish, maybe in Denmark,\" Dal-Lewkovitch said.",
      "Local churchgoer Katrine Sihm said that she has followed the project since its planning stages and is looking forward to attending services here.",

      "MADRID -- Six weeks after Spain and Portugal suffered a massive power outage, authorities in Madrid issued an official report Tuesday, saying April\u2019s cascading blackout that left tens of millions disconnected in seconds was caused by technical and planning errors that led to the grid's failure.",
      "Spain's Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen, who manages the nation's energy policy, said in a press conference that small grid failures, concentrated in the south of Spain, led to a chain reaction among larger ones, while completely ruling out questions about a cyberattack.",
      "The minister said several technical causes that contributed to the event, including \u201cthe poor planning\u201d by operators of the grid who didn't find a replacement for one power plant that was supposed to help balance power fluctuations.",
      "The April 28 outage started shortly after 12:30 pm in Spain and lasted through nightfall, disrupting businesses, transit systems, cellular networks, Internet connectivity and other critical infrastructures. In just five seconds, Spain lost 15 gigawatts of electricity \u2014 or about 60% of its supply. Portugal, whose grid is connected to Spain's, also went down. Only the countries' island territories were spared.",
      "Power was fully restored by the early hours of the following day.",
      "The government report included analysts from Spain's national security agencies, which concluded, according to the minister, there were no indications of cyber-sabotage by foreign actors.",
      "The only solid information made public shortly after the system went down came from Spain's grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica, which had narrowed down the source of the outage to two separate incidents in southern Spain where substations had failed.",
      "In the weeks following the blackout, citizens and experts were left wondering what triggered the event in a region not known for power outages and igniting a fierce debate about whether Spain's high levels of renewable power had something to do with the grid failing.",
      "Spain is at the forefront of Europe's transition to renewable energy, having generated nearly 57% of its electricity in 2024 from renewable energy sources like wind, hydropower and solar. The country is also phasing out its nuclear plants.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez pushed back against such speculation and defended renewables. He asked for patience and said that his government would not \u201cdeviate a single millimeter\u201d from its energy transition plans, which include a goal of generating 81% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.",

      "After years of delay, South Korea has ratified the Hague Adoption Convention, an international treaty meant to safeguard international adoptions",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After years of delay, South Korea has ratified the Hague Adoption Convention, an international treaty meant to safeguard international adoptions, highlighting a significant policy shift decades after sending tens of thousands of children to the West through an aggressive but poorly regulated adoption system.",
      "The government\u2019s announcement Tuesday came as it faces growing pressure to address widespread fraud and abuse that plagued its adoption program, particularly during a heyday in the 1970s and '80s when the country allowed thousands of children to be adopted every year.",
      "Many adoptees have since discovered that their records were falsified to portray them as abandoned orphans, while others were carelessly removed \u2014 or even outright stolen \u2014 from their birth families.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry and Health and Welfare Ministry, which handles adoption policies, issued a joint statement saying the country submitted the necessary documents to ratify the Hague Adoption Convention to the Dutch Foreign Ministry, the treaty\u2019s depositary.",
      "The treaty, which requires countries to strengthen state oversight and safeguards to ensure international adoptions are legal and ethical, will take effect in South Korea on Oct. 1.",
      "South Korea signed the Hague convention in 2013, but ratification was delayed by more than a decade as the country struggled to bring adoptions under centralized government authority, as required by the treaty, after allowing private agencies to control international child placements for decades.",
      "\u201cGoing forward, intercountry adoptions will be permitted only when no suitable family can be found in his or her state of origin, and only if deemed to serve the child\u2019s best interests through deliberation by the adoption policy committee under the Ministry of Health and Welfare,\u201d the ministries said.",
      "The statement said the ratification was a significant step toward safeguarding children's rights and \u201cestablishing an advanced, internationally compliant intercountry adoption system in Korea, reinforcing the government\u2019s commitment to upholding state responsibility across the entire adoption process.\u201d",
      "A 2023 law also mandates the transfer of all adoption records from private agencies to the National Center for the Rights of the Child by July, aiming to centralize processing family search requests from adoptees who have returned to South Korea as adults seeking their roots.",
      "International adoptions from South Korea have plummeted in recent years, with only 58 in 2024, according to government data.",
      "During the 1980s, South Korea sent an average of more than 6,000 children abroad each year, under a previous military government that viewed adoption as a way to reduce mouths to feed and curry favor with Western nations.",
      "Authorities specifically targeted children deemed socially undesirable, including those born to unwed mothers or impoverished families, and granted extensive powers to private adoption agencies to dictate child relinquishments and custody transfers, allowing them to send huge numbers of children abroad quickly.",
      "Much of South Korea\u2019s recent reforms have focused on abuse prevention, including a 2011 law reinstating judicial oversight of foreign adoptions that led to a significant drop in international placements. But officials are at a loss over how to handle the huge numbers of inaccurate or falsified records accumulated over past decades, which have prevented many adoptees from reconnecting with their birth families or obtaining accurate information about their biological origins.",
      "In a landmark report in March, South Korea\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children\u2019s backgrounds and origins.",
      "The commission\u2019s findings broadly aligned with a 2024 Associated Press investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), which detailed how South Korea\u2019s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply around 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means.",
      "South Korea\u2019s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues related to past adoptions and has so far ignored the commission\u2019s recommendation to issue an apology.",
      "Some adoptees criticized the truth commission\u2019s cautiously worded report, arguing it should have more forcefully acknowledged the government\u2019s complicity and offered more concrete recommendations for reparations for illegal adoption victims.",
      "The commission\u2019s investigation deadline expired in May, after it confirmed human rights violations in just 56 of the 367 complaints filed by adoptees since 2022. The fate of the remaining 311 cases, either deferred or incompletely reviewed, hinges on whether lawmakers will establish a new truth commission through legislation.",

      "MCCLEAN, Va. -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage eased for the third week in a row, a welcome trend for prospective homebuyers at a time when elevated borrowing costs remain a drag on the housing market.",
      "The long-term rate fell to 6.81% from 6.84% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.87%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell. The average rate eased to 5.96% from 5.97% last week. A year ago, it was 6.13%, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. The key barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.35% at midday Wednesday, down from 4.58% just a few weeks ago.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "With the latest decline, the average rate is now back to where it was in mid-May, reflecting a recent pullback in bond yields.",
      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power.

      "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
      "A small, growing number of employers are putting health insurance decisions entirely in the hands of their workers.",
      "Instead of offering traditional insurance, they\u2019re giving workers money to buy their own coverage in what\u2019s known as Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or ICHRAs.",
      "Advocates say this approach provides small companies that couldn\u2019t afford insurance a chance to offer something. It also caps a growing expense for employers and fits conservative political goals of giving people more purchasing power over their coverage.",
      "But ICHRAs place the risk for finding coverage on the employee, and they force them to do something many dislike: Shop for insurance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not perfect, but it\u2019s solving a problem for a lot of people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, of the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how this approach to health insurance is evolving.",
      "Normally, U.S. employers offering health coverage will have one or two insurance options for workers through what\u2019s known as a group plan. The employers then pick up most of the premium, or cost of coverage.",
      "ICHRAs are different: Employers contribute to health insurance coverage, but the workers then pick their own insurance plans. The employers that use ICHRAs hire outside firms to help people make their coverage decisions.",
      "ICHRAs were created during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration. Enrollment started slowly but has swelled in recent years.",
      "They give business owners a predictable cost, and they save companies from having to make coverage decisions for employees.",
      "\u201cYou have so many things you need to focus on as a business owner to just actually grow the business,\u201d said Jeff Yuan, co-founder of the New York-based insurance startup Taro Health.",
      "Small businesses, in particular, can be vulnerable to annual insurance cost spikes, especially if some employees have expensive medical conditions. But the ICHRA approach keeps the employer cost more predictable.",
      "Yuan's company bases its contributions on the employee's age and how many people are covered under the plan. That means it may contribute anywhere from $400 to more than $2,000 monthly to an employee's coverage.",
      "ICHRAs let people pick from among dozens of options in an individual insurance market instead of just taking whatever their company offers.",
      "That may give people a chance to find coverage more tailored to their needs. Some insurers, for instance, offer plans designed for people with diabetes.",
      "And workers can keep the coverage if they leave \u2014 potentially for longer periods than they would be able to with traditional employer health insurance plans. They likely will have to pay the full premium, but keeping the coverage also means they won\u2019t have to find a new plan that covers their doctors.",
      "Mark Bertolini, CEO of the insurer Oscar Health, noted that most people change jobs several times.",
      "\u201cInsurance works best when it moves with the consumer,\u201d said the executive, whose company is growing enrollment through ICHRAs in several states.",
      "Health insurance plans on the individual market tend to have narrower coverage networks than employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "It may be challenging for patients who see several doctors to find one plan that covers them all.",
      "People shopping for their own insurance can find coverage choices and terms like deductibles or coinsurance overwhelming. That makes it important for employers to provide help with plan selection.",
      "The broker or technology platform setting up a company\u2019s ICHRA generally does this by asking about their medical needs or if they have any surgeries planned in the coming year.",
      "There are no good numbers nationally that show how many people have coverage through an ICHRA or a separate program for companies with 50 workers or less.",
      "However, the HRA Council, a trade association that promotes the arrangements, sees big growth. The council works with companies that help employers offer the ICHRAs. It studies growth in a sample of those businesses.",
      "It says about 450,000 people were offered coverage through these arrangements this year. That\u2019s up 50% from 2024. Council Executive Director Robin Paoli says the total market may be twice as large.",
      "Still, these arrangements make up a sliver of employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through work last year, according to KFF.",
      "Several things could cause more employers to offer ICHRAs. As health care costs continue to climb, more companies may look to limit their exposure to the hit.",
      "Some tax breaks and incentives that encourage the arrangements could wind up in a final version of the Republican tax bill currently under consideration in the Senate.",
      "More people also will be eligible for the arrangements if extra government subsidies that help buy coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual marketplaces expire this year.",
      "You can\u2019t participate in an ICHRA if you are already getting a subsidy from the government, noted Brian Blase, a White House health policy adviser in the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe enhanced subsidies, they crowd out private financing,\u201d he said.",

      "Each of the three credit bureaus allow you to check your credit score for free at least once a year, and many banks offer this service as well.",
      "Other companies such as NerdWallet, Credit Karma and WalletHub also offer the service.",
      "A score of 670 or higher is considered \u201cgood.\u201d If your credit score is over 750, that's considered \u201cgreat.\u201d",
      "\u201cFair\u201d credit scores are in the 580-669 range, and a score below 580 is considered \u201cpoor.\u201d",
      "In the first three months of 2025, 2.2 million student loan recipients saw their scores drop by 100 points, and an additional 1 million had drops of 150 points or more, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The study's authors attribute those changes to loans falling into delinquency, or 90 days or more of nonpayment, which is then reported to credit bureaus.",
      "To avoid those consequences, or to improve your score, the simplest steps include paying at least the monthly minimum payment and setting up auto-pay to make sure payments are never late.",
      "Alev says that it's worthwhile to get into the habit of regularly checking your score, so that you're never surprised by any changes, and you can dispute any errors or negative dips.",
      "\u201cIt's important to monitor for mistakes you need to dispute,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you've only missed one payment, or it's your first time missing a payment, you can often call and ask for forgiveness because of a history of solid payments.\u201d",
      "Many borrowers reported that they never received notice from the Department of Education that their student loan payments were resuming, even though they were meant to have been notified at least three weeks in advance. Monitoring your credit score regularly means you can catch any changes before it\u2019s too late to correct significant hits.",
      "Maintaining a steady, low credit usage, known as credit utilization, is another straightforward way to improve your score, Alev said.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a confusing term, but credit usage is key,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially what percentage of your available credit you\u2019re currently using. If you have a $10,000 credit limit each month, and you use $2,000, that\u2019s a 20% credit utilization. An easy rules of thumb to remember is to keep your utilization below 30%. That\u2019s where you see the score impact accelerate.\u201d",
      "Checking your credit score doesn't lower it unless you're making a \u201c hard inquiry,\u201d which is only done when requesting a line of credit.",
      "Soft inquiries, which just let you know your current score, don't affect your score.",
      "When you do apply for a line of credit such as for a mortgage or a car loan, lenders do make \u201chard inquiries,\u201d which appear on your report and can affect your credit.",

      "The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, delaying the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it.

      "\u201cTogether, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel will be a world-leading steelmaker, with best-in-class technologies and manufacturing capabilities,\u201d the companies said.",
      "The combined company will become the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, and bring what analysts say is Nippon Steel's top-notch technology to U.S. Steel's antiquated steelmaking processes. In exchange, Nippon Steel gets access to a robust U.S. steel market, strengthened in recent years by tariffs under President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, analysts say.",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel did not list the full terms of the deal, and did not release a national security agreement struck with Trump's administration.",
      "But in a statement Wednesday, the companies said the federal government will have the right to appoint an independent director and \u201cconsent rights\u201d on specific matters. Those include reductions in Nippon Steel's capital commitments in the national security agreement, closing or idling of U.S. Steel\u2019s existing domestic facilities and changing U. S.

That\u2019s when the idea of the \u201cgolden share\u201d emerged as a way to resolve national security concerns and protect American interests in domestic steel production.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel also made a series of bigger capital commitments in U.S. Steel facilities, tallying $11 billion through 2028, it said.",

    "story": [
      "On a former military base in Galena, Alaska, a school that houses about 200 high school students teaches sustainability among many things",
      "GALENA, Alaska -- Eric Huntington built his dream cabin nestled in the wilderness of central Alaska, eventually raising two daughters there. But over the years, he learned that living in this quiet, remote village came with a hefty cost.",
      "Every year, the Huntington family spent about $7,000 on diesel to heat the cabin during bone-chilling winters, and a few years back, a power outage at the town's diesel plant left residents freezing in minus 50 F (about minus 45 C). When power finally returned hours later, water pipes had frozen, leaving about two dozen homes without running water for days.",
      "\"We just didn\u2019t open our door all morning until the lights came back on,\u201d said Huntington, a member of the local Louden Tribe.",
      "In Galena, a sprawling village of 400 people on the banks of the Yukon River, a community built around a former military base is shifting to clean energy in an effort to reduce its reliance on expensive, imported diesel. Local leaders say their nearly completed solar farm, along with an existing biomass plant, will boost the town's savings and protect residents from blackouts during extreme weather. The technology has the potential to provide clean backup power in emergencies and improve the power grid's resiliency, all while diversifying the village's energy sources and providing job opportunities for locals.",
      "The projects come at a precarious time for renewable energy transition in the United States. The Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars of clean energy grants in an effort to bolster fossil fuel production, and billions more in investments have been scrapped or delayed this year. So far, the village's federal grants for the solar array haven't been impacted, but local leaders know the risk remains. Whatever the future of public funding, the village is an example of how renewable energies can save costs, boost reliability during extreme weather and create jobs.",
      "Once online, the solar array will ensure that the village\u2019s power grid has a backup system, said Tim Kalke, general manager of Sustainable Energy for Galena Alaska \u2014 or SEGA \u2014 a nonprofit that will operate it. So when the power goes out, it doesn\u2019t result in tens of thousands of dollars in repairs, he added, and heat is guaranteed in times of extreme cold.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with life, health and safety,\u201d he said.",
      "In May, dozens of high school students in navy blue caps and gowns stood with nervous excitement in a locker-brimmed hallway, each waiting their turn to walk through yellow tinsel into a packed auditorium. It was graduation day for Galena Interior Learning Academy.",
      "The school's vocational training courses and cultural offerings attract some 200 students annually from across Alaska, boosting the village's population and energy needs.",
      "Students here can take classes on sustainable energy, aviation, carpentry and much more. But in order to keep it running \u2014 especially during long, cold winters \u2014 it needs heat.",
      "That's where the biomass project comes in. Every winter since 2016, trees (mostly paper birch) are locally harvested and shredded into wood chips that fuel a large boiler plant on campus, offsetting about 100,000 gallons (about 380,000 liters) of diesel annually for the school district and the city, said Brad Scotton, a Galena City Council member who also serves on SEGA's board. It's notable as one of the state's first large-scale biomass plants and is the most rural, he added.",
      "Cost savings from using biomass has allowed the Galena City School District to hire certified professionals in trade jobs and do upkeep on campus facilities, said district superintendent Jason R. Johnson in an email.",
      "It's also created a local workforce and a job base the village never used to have. \u201cIt's keeping the money that used to go outside within the community and providing pretty meaningful jobs for people,\" Scotton said.",
      "In rural areas of Alaska, the costs for many goods can be high, as they must be brought in. Galena burns just under 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of diesel annually to produce electricity, and an energy price hike around 2008 helped the village realize something needed to change. Scotton remembered when a gallon of diesel was $1.64 and then skyrocketed to $4.58 another year. At that wholesale price, the city was paying more than $1.8 million to keep the lights on.",
      "\u201cIt was really quite a shock to everybody\u2019s system in terms of trying to operate with those elevated costs,\u201d said Scotton. \u201cSo that really got the community assessing whether or not we could continue business as usual with that reliance.\u201d That's when they started looking for grants to build a solar array.",
      "On an overcast May day, on a field flanked by boreal forests, workers in reflective safety vests slotted rectangular panels on a metal grid. They were working on the nearly-completed, 1.5 megawatt solar farm that will connect to a battery system.",
      "Once in use, the community will be able to turn off its diesel engines and run on 100% clean, renewable energy on sunny summer days, and any excess power will be battery stored for nights, emergencies or heating the local indoor pool. The solar array will allow them to shut off the diesel operation between 800 to 1,000 hours a year, totaling about 100,000 gallons (about 380,000 liters).",
      "The solar farm won\u2019t necessarily lower people\u2019s electricity bills. But like the biomass plant, the hope is that it will stabilize energy costs, allowing those savings to go back into the community, all while providing work opportunities for residents like Aaren Sommer.",
      "Last year, the 19-year old graduated from the academy, where he learned about solar energy. Now he's helping to install the solar array. \u201cThat\u2019s going to reduce the diesel usage a whole bunch over at the power plant, which is going to help us out,\u201d he said.",
      "In addition to the solar farm and biomass project, the Louden Tribe is building new energy-efficient homes that will help members be less reliant on diesel. Some of the siding used in the homes comes from wood harvested in the area.",
      "In November, the Huntington family moved into a new, stilted house with a solar-compatible roof, 13-inch (33-centimeter) walls and 18 inches (46 centimeters) of insulation to keep the cold at bay. When they lived in the cabin, the $7,000 a year Huntington spent on diesel was a good chunk of his annual income.",
      "The new home's energy-efficient features are already saving them money. The 300-gallon (1,130-liter) diesel tank Huntington filled before moving cost him about $2,400. Six months later, he still has unused fuel in the tank.",
      "The Huntingtons are one of eight families the tribe has moved into sustainable homes, and they plan to turn over the keys to three more this year.",
      "Kalke, SEGA's general manager, is often asked what Galena produces. He used to just say education.",
      "\"But since 2016 you can say education and wood chips. And soon, solar energy,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits dipped to 245,000 last week, hovering at historically low levels, the Labor Department said Wednesday.",
      "U.S. jobless claims ticked down from 250,000 the week before. Economists had expected last week's claims to match that at 250,000.",

      "The number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits the week of June 7 slid to 1.95 million.",
      "Weekly unemployment claim are a proxy for layoffs and mostly have stayed within a healthy band of 200,000 to 250,000 since the economy recovered from a brief but painful COVID-19 recession in 2020, which temporarily wiped out millions of jobs.",
      "In recent weeks, however, claims have stayed at the high end of range, adding to evidence that U.S. job market is decelerating after years of strong hiring. So far this year, employers are adding a decent but far from spectacular 124,000 jobs a month, down from an average 168,000 last year and an average of nearly 400,000 from 2021 through 2023.",
      "The hiring slowdown is partly the drawn-out result of 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023. But Trump\u2019s aggressive and often-erratic trade policies \u2014 including 10% taxes on imports from almost every country on earth \u2014 are also weighing on the economy, paralyzing businesses and worrying consumers who fear they\u2019ll mean higher prices.",
      "Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics is worried that claims remain elevated compared with recent years, when employment has remained very low by historical standards.",
      "\u201cWe believe firms have been \u2018hoarding\u2019 workers to ensure that they don\u2019t lay off skilled and trained workers by mistake, especially with the labor market still very close to full employment,\u201d Weinberg wrote. \"With uncertainty still high ... companies have remained hesitant about layoffs. That may be changing.''",
      "The Fed, satisfied that an inflation was coming down, cut rates three times last year. But the central bank has turned cautious in 2025, worried that Trump\u2019s tariffs will rekindle inflationary pressures. The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged as it wraps up a two-day meeting Wednesday.",

      "In Gaza and Africa, U.S. contracting firms led by former American intelligence and military officers are taking on aid delivery in conflict zones",
      "ON A PLANE OVER UPPER NILE STATE, South Sudan -- Swooping low over the banks of a Nile River tributary, an aid flight run by retired American military officers released a stream of food-stuffed sacks over a town emptied by fighting in South Sudan, a country wracked by conflict.",
      "Last week's air drop was the latest in a controversial development \u2014 private contracting firms led by former U.S. intelligence officers and military veterans delivering aid to some of the world's deadliest conflict zones, in operations organized with governments that are combatants in the conflicts.",
      "The moves are roiling the global aid community, which warns of a more militarized, politicized and profit-seeking trend that could allow governments or combatants to use life-saving aid to control hungry civilian populations and advance war aims.",
      "In South Sudan and Gaza, two for-profit U.S. companies led by American national security veterans are delivering aid in operations backed by the South Sudanese and Israeli governments.",
      "The American contractors say they're putting their security, logistics and intelligence skills to work in relief operations. Fogbow, the U.S. company that carried out last week's air drops over South Sudan, says it aims to be a \u201chumanitarian\u201d force.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked for careers, collectively, in conflict zones. And we know how to essentially make very difficult situations work,\u201d said Fogbow President Michael Mulroy, a retired CIA officer and former senior defense official in the first Trump administration, speaking on the airport tarmac in Juba, South Sudan's capital.",
      "But the U.N. and many leading non-profit groups say U.S. contracting firms are stepping into aid distribution with little transparency or humanitarian experience, and, crucially, without commitment to humanitarian principles of neutrality and operational independence in war zones.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned over the years of successes and failures is there\u2019s a difference between a logistics operation and a security operation, and a humanitarian operation,\u201d said Scott Paul, a director at Oxfam America.",
      "\u201c\u2018Truck and chuck\u2019 doesn\u2019t help people,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt puts people at risk.\u201d",
      "Fogbow took journalists up in a cargo plane to watch their team drop 16 tons of beans, corn and salt for South Sudan's Upper Nile state town of Nasir.",
      "Residents fled homes there after fighting erupted in March between the government and opposition groups.",
      "Mulroy acknowledged the controversy over Fogbow's aid drops, which he said were paid for by the South Sudanese government.",
      "But, he maintained: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to replace any entity\u201d in aid work.",
      "Fogbow was in the spotlight last year for its proposal to use barges to bring aid to Gaza, where Israeli restrictions were blocking overland deliveries. The United States focused instead on a U.S. military effort to land aid via a temporary pier.",
      "Since then, Fogbow has carried out aid drops in Sudan and South Sudan, east African nations where wars have created some of the world's gravest humanitarian crises.",
      "Fogbow says ex-humanitarian officials are also involved, including former U.N. World Food Program head David Beasley, who is a senior adviser.",
      "Operating in Gaza, meanwhile, Safe Reach Solutions, led by a former CIA officer and other retired U.S. security officers, has partnered with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed nonprofit that Israel says is the linchpin of a new aid system to wrest control from the U.N., which Israel says has been infiltrated by Hamas, and other humanitarian groups.",
      "Starting in late May, the American-led operation in Gaza has distributed food at fixed sites in southern Gaza, in line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's stated plan to use aid to concentrate the territory's more than 2 million people in the south, freeing Israel to fight Hamas elsewhere. Aid workers fear it's a step toward another of Netanyahu\u2019s public goals, removing Palestinians from Gaza in \u201cvoluntary\u201d migrations.",
      "Since then, several hundred Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded in near daily shootings as they tried to reach aid sites, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Witnesses say Israeli troops regularly fire heavy barrages toward the crowds in an attempt to control them.",
      "The Israeli military has denied firing on civilians. It says it fired warning shots in several instances, and fired directly at a few \u201csuspects\u201d who ignored warnings and approached its forces.",
      "It\u2019s unclear who is funding the new operation in Gaza. No donor has come forward, and the U.S. says it\u2019s not funding it.",
      "In response to criticism over its Gaza aid deliveries, Safe Reach Solutions said it has former aid workers on its team with \u201cdecades of experience in the world\u2019s most complex environments\u201d who bring \"expertise to the table, along with logisticians and other experts.\u201c",
      "Last week's air drop over South Sudan went without incident, despite fighting nearby. A white cross marked the drop zone. Only a few people could be seen. Fogbow contractors said there were more newly returned townspeople on previous drops.",
      "Fogbow acknowledges glitches in mastering aid drops, including one last year in Sudan\u2019s South Kordofan region that ended up with too-thinly-wrapped grain sacks split open on the ground.",
      "After gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan has struggled to emerge from a civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people. Rights groups say its government is one of the world\u2019s most corrupt, and until now has invested little in quelling the dire humanitarian crisis.",
      "South Sudan said it engaged Fogbow for air drops partly because of the Trump administration\u2019s deep cuts in U.S. Agency for International Development funding. Humanitarian Minister Albino Akol Atak said the drops will expand to help people in need throughout the country.",
      "But two South Sudanese groups question the government's motives.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see a humanitarian space being abused by military actors ... under the cover of a food drop,\" said Edmund Yakani, head of the Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, a local civil society group.",
      "Asked about suspicions the aid drops were helping South Sudan's military aims, Fogbow's Mulroy said the group has worked with the U.N. World Food Program to make sure \u201cthis aid is going to civilians.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it wasn't going to civilians, we would hope that we would get that feedback, and we would cease and desist,\u201d Mulroy said.",
      "In a statement, WFP country director Mary-Ellen McGroarty said: \u201cWFP is not involved in the planning, targeting or distribution of food air-dropped\u201d by Fogbow on behalf of South Sudan's government, citing humanitarian principles.",
      "Longtime humanitarian leaders and analysts are troubled by what they see as a teaming up of warring governments and for-profit contractors in aid distribution.",
      "When one side in a conflict decides where and how aid is handed out, and who gets it, \u201cit will always result in some communities getting preferential treatment,\u201d said Jan Egeland, executive director of the Norwegian Refugee Council.",
      "Sometimes, that set-up will advance strategic aims, as with Netanyahu's plans to move Gaza's civilians south, Egeland said.",
      "The involvement of soldiers and security workers, he added, can make it too \u201cintimidating\u201d for some in need to even try to get aid.",
      "Until now, Western donors always understood those risks, Egeland said. But pointing to the Trump administration's backing of the new aid system in Gaza, he asked: \u201cWhy does the U.S. ... want to support what they have resisted with every other war zone for two generations?\u201d",
      "Mark Millar, who has advised the U.N. and Britain on humanitarian matters in South Sudan and elsewhere, said involving private military contractors risks undermining the distinction between humanitarian assistance and armed conflict.",
      "Private military contractors \u201chave even less sympathy for a humanitarian perspective that complicates their business-driven model,\" he said. \u201cAnd once let loose, they seem to be even less accountable.\u201d",

      "All 50 U.S. states have agreed to the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma \u2019s latest plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids.",
      "A judge on Wednesday is being asked to clear the way for local governments and individual victims to vote on it.",
      "Government entities, emergency room doctors, insurers, families of children born into withdrawal from the powerful prescription painkiller, individual victims and their families and others would have until Sept. 30 to vote on whether to accept the deal, which calls for members of the Sackler family who own the company to pay up to $7 billion over 15 years.",
      "If approved, the settlement would be among the largest in a wave of lawsuits over the past decade as governments and others sought to hold drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies accountable for the opioid epidemic that started rising in the years after OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The other settlements together are worth about $50 billion, and most of the money is to be used to combat the crisis.",
      "In the early 2000s, most opioid deaths were linked to prescription drugs, including OxyContin. Since then, heroin and then illicitly produced fentanyl became the biggest killers. In some years, the class of drugs was linked to more than 80,000 deaths, but that number dropped sharply last year.",
      "The request of U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane comes about a year after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous version of Purdue\u2019s proposed settlement. The court found it was improper that the earlier iteration would have protected members of the Sackler family from lawsuits over opioids, even though they themselves were not filing for bankruptcy protection.",
      "Under the reworked plan hammered out with lawyers for state and local governments and others, groups that don\u2019t opt in to the settlement would still have the right to sue members of the wealthy family whose name once adorned museum galleries around the world and programs at several prestigious U.S. universities.",
      "Under the plan, the Sackler family members would give up ownership of Purdue. They resigned from the company\u2019s board and stopped receiving distributions from its funds before the company\u2019s initial bankruptcy filing in 2019. The remaining entity would get a new name and its profits would be dedicated to battling the epidemic.",
      "Most of the money would go to state and local governments to address the nation\u2019s addiction and overdose crisis, but potentially more than $850 million would go directly to individual victims. That makes it different from the other major settlements.",
      "The payouts would not begin until after a hearing scheduled for Nov. 10, during which Lane is to be asked to approve the entire plan if enough of the affected parties agree.",

      "The bill\u2019s approval comes as tensions have been increasing between the Senate and President Gustavo Petro over reforms to the economy and health system that have polarized the nation\u2019s politics and tested the separation of powers in Colombia\u2019s fragile democracy.",

      "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The acting chief of the country\u2019s top agency for enforcing worker rights will face questions at a Senate committee hearing Wednesday over her efforts to prioritize anti-diversity investigations while sidelining certain racial and gender discrimination cases and quashing protections for transgender workers.",
      "Andrea Lucas, who was first appointed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2020 and elevated to acting chief in January, is one of four Labor Department nominees to appear before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Her nomination to serve another five-year term as an EEOC commissioner requires Senate confirmation, though whether she stays on as chief will be up to President Donald Trump.",
      "Lucas, an outspoken critic of diversity, equity and inclusion practices and promoter of the idea that there are only two immutable sexes, has moved swiftly to enact Trump's civil rights agenda after he abruptly fired two of the EEOC's Democratic commissioners before the end of their five-year terms, an unprecedented move in the agency's 60-year history that has been challenged in a lawsuit.",
      "Lucas is prioritizing worker rights that conservatives argue have been ignored by the EEOC. That includes investigating company DEI practices, defending the rights of women to same-sex spaces and fighting anti-Christian bias in the workplace.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chairman of the Senate committee holding the hearing, has championed many of those causes. He accused the EEOC under the Biden administration of \u201cinjecting its far-left\" agenda into the workplace, including by updating sexual harassment guidelines to warn against misgendering transgender workers and including abortion as a pregnancy-related condition under regulations for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.",
      "Democrats on the committee are likely to grill Lucas over criticism that she overstepped her authority by profoundly shifting the EEOC's direction to the whims of the president in the absence of a quorum, which commission has lacked since Trump fired the two commissioners.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, a member of the committee, said she will oppose any EEOC nominations unless Trump reinstates the two fired Democratic commissioners, which she and more than 200 other Democratic senators and Congress members condemned in a letter to the president as an abuse of power.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is weaponizing the independent EEOC to serve his personal political agenda, firing commissioners without cause and warping the mission of the EEOC beyond recognition,\u201d Murray said in a statement ahead of the hearing. \u201cCommissioner Lucas is a right-wing extremist who has been in lockstep behind Trump\u2019s pro-discrimination agenda.\u201d",
      "Lucas has made clear her views of the limitations of the EEOC's autonomy. In a recent memo to employers, Lucas declared that the \u201cEEOC is an executive branch agency, not an independent agency\" that will \"fully and robustly comply\" with all executive orders. That includes two orders that Trump signed in January: one directing federal agencies to eliminate their own DEI activities and end any \u201cequity-related\u201d grants or contracts, and the other imposing a certification provision on all companies and institutions with government contracts or grant dollars to demonstrate that they don\u2019t operate DEI programs.",
      "The EEOC's new approach alarmed more than 30 civil rights groups, which sent a letter to the Senate committee demanding that Lucas face a hearing. The groups argued that the EEOC was created by Congress under 1964 Civil Rights Act to be a bipartisan agency that would function independently from the executive branch.",
      "The EEOC, the only federal agency empowered to investigate employment discrimination in the private sector, received more than 88,000 charges of workplace discrimination in fiscal year 2024. Its commissioners are appointed by the president to staggered terms, and no more than three can be from the same party. Much of the EEOC's authority is granted by Congress, including the obligation to investigate all complaints and enact regulations for implementing some laws.",
      "Under Lucas, the EEOC dropped seven of its own lawsuits on behalf of transgender or nonbinary workers. It also moved to drop a racial discrimination case on behalf of Black, Native American and multiracial job applicants after Trump ordered federal agencies to stop pursuing discrimination that falls under \u201cdisparate impact liability,\u201d which aims to identify practices that systematically exclude certain demographic groups.",
      "Instead, Lucas has turned the EEOC's attention to investigating company DEI practices. In her most high profile move, she sent letters to 20 law firms demanding information about diversity fellowships and other programs she claimed could be evidence of discriminatory practices.",
      "Lucas has also repeatedly encouraged workers nationwide to come forward with DEI complaints. She launched a hotline for whistleblowers and said workers should be encouraged to report bad DEI practices after a Supreme Court decision made it easier for white and other non-minority workers to bring reverse-discrimination lawsuits.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and budget bill would increase deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade after factoring in other economic effects",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts package would increase deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade after including other economic effects, according to a fuller analysis of the House-passed measure released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The report, produced by the nonpartisan CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation, factors in expected debt service costs and finds that the bill would increase interest rates and boost interest payments on the baseline projection of federal debt by $441 billion.",
      "The analysis comes at a crucial moment as Trump is pushing the GOP-led Congress to act on what he calls his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\" It passed the House last month on a party-line vote, and now faces revisions in the Senate. Vice President JD Vance urged Senate Republicans during a private lunch meeting Tuesday to send the final package to the president's desk.",
      "\u201cWe're excited to get this bill out,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune afterward.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s report uses dynamic analysis by estimating the budgetary impact of the tax bill by considering how changes in the economy might affect revenues and spending. This is in contrast to static scoring, which presumes all other economic factors stay constant.",
      "The CBO released its static scoring analysis earlier this month, estimating that Trump\u2019s bill would unleash trillions in tax cuts and slash spending, but also increase deficits by $2.4 trillion over the decade and leave some 10.9 million more people without health insurance.",
      "Republicans have repeatedly argued that a more dynamic scoring model would more accurately show how cutting taxes would spur economic growth \u2014 essentially overcoming any lost revenue to the federal government.",
      "But the larger deficit numbers in the new analysis gave Democrats, who are unified against the big bill, fresh arguments for challenging the GOP position that the tax cuts would essentially pay for themselves.",
      "\u201cThe Republican claim that this bill does not add to the debt or deficit is laughable, and the proof is in the numbers,\" said Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "\u201cThe cost of these tax giveaways for billionaires, even when considering economic growth, will add even more to the debt than we previously expected,\u201d he said.",
      "Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Tuesday on social media that considering the new dynamic analysis, \u201cIt\u2019s not only not paying for all of itself, it\u2019s not paying for any of itself.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other Republicans have sought to discredit the CBO, saying the organization isn\u2019t giving enough credit to the economic growth the bill will create.",
      "At the Capitol, Mehmet Oz, who heads up the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and joined Vance at the GOP Senate lunch, challenged CBO's findings when asked about its estimate that the bill would leave 10.9 million more people without health care, largely from new work requirements.",
      "\u201cWhat will an American do if they\u2019re given the option of trying to get a job or an education or volunteering their community \u2014 having some engagement \u2014 or losing their Medicaid insurance coverage?\u201d Oz asked. \u201cI have more confidence in the American people than has been given to them by some of these analyzing organizations.\u201d",
      "Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee unveiled their proposal Monday for deeper Medicaid cuts, including new work requirements for parents of teens, as a way to offset the costs of making Trump\u2019s tax breaks more permanent in their draft for the big bill.",
      "The Senate's version of the package also enhances Trump\u2019s proposed new tax break for seniors, with a bigger $6,000 deduction for low- to moderate-income senior households earning no more than $75,000 a year for singles, $150,000 for couples.",
      "The proposals from Senate Republicans keep in place the current $10,000 deduction of state and local taxes, called SALT, drawing quick blowback from GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states, who fought for a $40,000 cap in the House-passed bill. Senators insisted negotiations continue.",
      "Bessent said Tuesday that the Senate Republican proposal for the tax cuts bill \u201cwill deliver the permanence and certainty both individual taxpayers and businesses alike are looking for, driving growth and unleashing the American economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to further refine this bill and get it to President Trump\u2019s desk,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "While the House-passed bill exempted parents with dependents from the new Medicaid work requirements, the Senate\u2019s version broadened the requirement to include parents of children older than 14, as part of their effort to combat waste in the program and push personal responsibility.",
      "The work requirements \u201cdemonstrate that you are trying your hardest to help this country be greater,\u201d Oz said. \u201cBy doing that, you earn the right to be on Medicaid.\u201d",
      "The CBO separately released another analysis on the tax bill last week, including a look at how the measure would affect households based on income distribution. It estimates the bill would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually.",

      "A federal court in Argentina has granted former Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s request to serve a six-year prison sentence for corruption at home",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- A federal court on Tuesday granted a request by former Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner to serve a six-year prison sentence for corruption at her home in Buenos Aires.",
      "Judges ruled that Fern\u00e1ndez, 72, can serve time in the apartment where she lives with her daughter and her granddaughter, citing her age and security reasons. Fern\u00e1ndez was the victim of an attempted assassination three years ago.",
      "In the ruling, obtained by The Associated Press, the court said Fern\u00e1ndez \u201cmust remain at the registered address, an obligation that she may not break except in exceptional situations.\"",
      "The court also ordered Fern\u00e1ndez be placed under the watch of an electronic surveillance device to monitor her movements.",
      "Last week, Argentina\u2019s highest court upheld Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s sentence in a ruling that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.",
      "The ruling against Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.",
      "The ruling barred Fern\u00e1ndez from running in this fall\u2019s Buenos Aires legislative election just days after she launched her campaign.",
      "On Tuesday, the court dismissed prosecutors' request that Fern\u00e1ndez serve time behind bars. Judges said that the physical integrity of the political leader \u201cwould become complex in a situation of prison confinement in coexistence with any type of prison population.\u201d",
      "Seeking to serve the sentence at home, the former president had argued that she is more than 70 years old \u2014 an extenuating circumstance taken into account by the justice system to grant the privilege.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country\u2019s main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism \u2014 after her and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner. She rejects the charges as politically motivated.",
      "During Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s eight years in office from 2007\u20132015, Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. Her governments funded unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for major budget deficits and sky-high inflation.",
      "Critics blamed Argentina\u2019s years of economic volatility on Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country\u2019s bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 of corruption in a case that centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a project that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claimed that her defense didn\u2019t have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges.",

      "Brazil has auctioned off several land and offshore potential oil sites near the Amazon River, aiming to expand production in untapped regions despite protests from environmental and Indigenous groups",
      "BRASILANDIA, Brazil -- BRASILANDIA, Brazil (AP) \u2014 Brazil auctioned off several land and offshore potential oil sites near the Amazon River on Tuesday as it aims to expand production in untapped regions despite protests from environmental and Indigenous groups.",
      "The event came months before Brazil is to host the U.N.\u2019s first climate talks held in the Amazon. The protesters outside Tuesday's venue warned of potential risks that oil drilling poses to sensitive ecosystems and Indigenous communities in the Amazon.",
      "A luxury Rio de Janeiro hotel hosted the auction conducted by the National Oil Agency. Most of the 172 oil blocks for sale are located in areas with no current production, such as 47 offshore locations close to the mouth of the Amazon River and two sites inland in the Amazon near Indigenous territories.",
      "Nineteen offshore blocks were awarded to Chevron, ExxonMobil, Petrobras and CNPC. The oil companies see the area as highly promising because it shares geological characteristics with Guyana, where some of the largest offshore oil discoveries of the 21st century have been made.",
      "This region is considered to have high potential risk due to strong currents and the proximity to the Amazon seashore.",
      "Under public pressure from President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, known as IBAMA, approved an emergency plan allowing state-run Petrobras to conduct exploratory drilling in a block near the mouth of the Amazon River, the last step to grant an environmental license.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable and concerning that blocks are being acquired in a basin that has not yet received environmental licensing,\u201d Nicole Oliveira, executive director of the environmental nonprofit Arayara, which tried to block the auction in court.",
      "\u201cThis is an irresponsible move by the National Oil Agency and a very risky one for the companies involved,\" Oliveira told The Associated Press. \"We will continue litigating to prevent the contracts from being signed and the blocks from being explored.\u201d",
      "The auction wrapped up with only 34 oil blocks awarded.",
      "Brazil\u00b4s oil agency noted that the signing bonuses \u2014 one-time payments made by the winning companies \u2014 totaled $180 million, a record for auctions of this kind. An agency representative said the highest premium was for a block located near the mouth of the Amazon River, which drew a nearly 3,000% markup.",
      "Oliveira took part in a peaceful protest that gathered about 200 people outside the auction site, from environmentalists to Indigenous leaders.",
      "\u201cWe came to Rio to repudiate the auction,\u201d said Giovane Tapura of the Manoki, an Amazon tribe. \u201cWe would have liked to be consulted and to see studies on how the oil drilling could affect us. None of this has been done.\u201d",
      "In a recorded opening statement at the start of the event, Brazil\u2019s National Oil Agency said the auctions are part of the country\u2019s energy diversification strategy aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon economy and that contracts signed with the winning companies include measures to reduce carbon intensity in production activities, as well as mandatory investments in energy transition projects.",
      "Brazil has increased crude oil production, which became the country\u2019s top export for the first time last year, surpassing soybeans.",
      "The auction is part of the federal government's goal to maintain and even expand output beyond 2030, when production from current oil blocks under exploration is expected to decline. Brazil gets most of its electricity from hydropower and other green energies.",
      "The U.N. climate talks will be held in the city of Belem, close to the mouth of the Amazon. Critics say it's a contradiction that Brazil's president is pushing for increased fossil fuel production while trying to cast himself as an environmental champion.",
      "Claudio Angelo, head of international policy at Climate Observatory, a coalition of 133 environmental, civil society and academic organizations, told reporters ahead of the auction that Brazil is both undermining its own standing ahead of the climate talks and undermining climate protection efforts.",
      "\u201cThe Brazilian government is endangering everyone\u2019s future since science has been crystal clear about the need to stop the expansion of fossil fuels everywhere in the world,\" he said.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration says it will begin offering faster reviews to new medicines that align with Trump administration priorities for Americans' health",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators will begin offering faster reviews to new medicines that administration officials deem as promoting \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d under a new initiative announced Tuesday.",
      "Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency will aim to review select drugs in one to two months. FDA's long-standing accelerated approval program generally issues decisions in six months for drugs that treat life-threatening diseases. Regular drug reviews take about 10 months.",
      "Since arriving at the FDA in April, Makary has repeatedly told FDA staff they need to \u201cchallenge assumptions\u201d and rethink procedures. In a medical journal commentary published last week, Makary suggested the agency could conduct \u201crapid or instant reviews,\" pointing to the truncated process used to authorize the first COVID-19 vaccines under Operation Warp Speed.",
      "For the new program, the FDA will issue a limited number of \u201cnational priority vouchers\u201d to companies \u201caligned with U.S. national priorities,\u201d the agency said in a statement. The special designation will give the selected companies access to extra FDA communications, streamlined staff reviews and the ability to submit much of their product information in advance.",
      "Speeding up drug approvals has long been a priority of the pharmaceutical industry, which has successfully lobbied Congress to create a variety of special programs and pathways for faster reviews.",
      "Many aspects of the plan announced Tuesday overlap with older programs. But the broad criteria for receiving a voucher will give FDA officials unprecedented discretion in deciding which companies can benefit from the fastest reviews.",
      "\"The ultimate goal is to bring more cures and meaningful treatments to the American public,\u201d Makary said in a statement.",
      "Makary previously said the FDA should be willing to ease its scientific requirements for certain drugs, for instance, by not always requiring randomized studies in which patients are tracked over time to track safety and effectiveness. Such trials are generally considered the gold standard of medical research, though the FDA has increasingly been willing to accept smaller, less-definitive studies for rare or life-threatening diseases.",
      "In several recent cases, the FDA has faced criticism for approving drugs based on preliminary data that didn't ultimately show benefits for patients.",
      "The push to rapidly accelerated drug approvals is the opposite approach that Makary and his boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have taken on vaccines.",
      "Promising a \u201creturn to gold-standard science,\u201d Kennedy previously announced that all new vaccines would have to be compared to placebo, or a dummy shot, to win approval. Kennedy and Makary also have announced a stricter policy on seasonal updates to COVID-19 shots, saying they will have to undergo new testing before they can be approved for use in healthy children and most adults.",

      "He indicated in an interview last month with NBC that he would be open to pushing back the deadline again.",
      "If announced, it would be the third time Trump has extended the deadline. The first one was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when the ban approved by Congress \u2014 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 took effect.

      "Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that almost 90% of its U.S. products already don't contain food, drug & cosmetic colors, but that the products that do still use the dyes will have them removed by the end of 2027. FD&C colors are synthetic additives that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food, drugs and cosmetics.",

      "The company plans to work with licensees of its brands to encourage them to remove the dyes.",
      "In April Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference that the agency would take steps to eliminate the synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children. The FDA has maintained that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes. In January, the agency announced that the dye known as Red 3 \u2014 used in candies, cakes and some medications \u2014 would be banned in food by 2027 because it caused cancer in laboratory rats.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes. Several states, including California and West Virginia, have passed laws restricting the use of artificial colors in foods.",

      "North Korea will send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to Russia",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea will send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to support reconstruction work in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, a top Russian official said Tuesday, the latest sign of expanding cooperation between the nations.",
      "North Korea has already supplied thousands of combat troops and a vast amount of conventional weapons to back Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. In April, Pyongyang and Moscow said that their soldiers fought together to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk border region, though Ukraine has insisted it still has troops present there.",
      "Wrapping up a one-day visit to Pyongyang, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un decided to send 1,000 sappers to clear mines in the Kursk region and 5,000 military construction workers to restore infrastructure there, according to Russia's state news agency, Tass.",
      "Another Russian state news agency, RIA Novosti, carried a similar report.",
      "\u201cFollowing the expulsion of invaders from Russian soil, we\u2019ve agreed to continue our constructive cooperation, with the Korean side providing assistance in the restoration of the Kursk region,\u201d Shoigu said, according to RIA Novosti. \"This is a kind of brotherly aid being sent by the Korean people and their leader, Kim Jong Un, to our country.\u201d",
      "Shoigu said that Moscow and Pyongyang agreed to erect memorials in both countries in honor of North Korean soldiers who died while fighting in the Kursk region, according to Tass and RIA Novosti.",
      "North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim confirmed the contents of North Korea\u2019s cooperation with Russia with regard to Kursk\u2019s current situation but didn't mention the dispatch of army construction workers and deminers cited by Russian media.",
      "KCNA quoted Kim as expressing his resolve to \u201cinvariably and unconditionally support\u201d what he called Russian efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Kim has previously made similar comments in support of Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "KCNA also said that Kim and Shoigu approved some plans for \u201cconveying long the heroic feats displayed by\u201d North Korean troops in operations to liberate the Kursk area, an apparent reference to the memorial construction plan.",
      "North Korea and Russia have never disclosed how many North Korean troops have been sent to Russia or how many of them were killed. But according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukraine assessments, about 15,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia. South Korea's spy agency said in April that about 600 North Korean soldiers died on the Russia-Ukraine battlefronts.",
      "The deepening ties between North Korea and Russia have raised worries among the U.S., South Korea and their partners that Russian President Vladimir Putin may in return provide Kim with much-needed sophisticated technologies that can help advance his nuclear and missile programs.",
      "The two countries, both in confrontations with the U.S. and its allies, have sharply grown closer to each other in recent years. In 2024, Kim and Putin signed a landmark defense treaty that requires each side to provide aid if the other is attacked.",
      "It was Shoigu\u2019s third visit to North Korea in about three months. The two countries have exchanged high-level visits in past years, with Kim travelling to Russia in 2023 and Putin to North Korea in 2024. Many observers say Kim could soon visit Russia again for another summit with Putin.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Thursday expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over what it described as ongoing illicit cooperation between North Korea and Russia.",
      "The U.S. State Department told South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency that Russia\u2019s continued use of North Korean workers and soldiers were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and stated that Pyongyang was \u201cnow relying on Russia to provide it with desperately needed funds in exchange for labor and soldier for hire schemes.\" Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba also expressed deep concern, saying advancing cooperation between Russia and North Korea threatens to jeopardize global security.",
      "On Wednesday, South Korea, the U.S. and Japan flew fighter jets for a trilateral aerial training off South Korea's southern Jeju island as part of their efforts to boost security cooperation to cope with North Korea's evolving nuclear threats, according to the South Korean air force.",
      "In South Korea, there are worries that the 2024 North Korea-Russia defense treaty would lead to Russia intervening in a potential conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Experts say North Korea's military would also obtain valuable combat experiences from the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "South Korea, the U.S. and others have stated the ongoing North Korean-Russia military cooperation involve elements that constitute clear violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions, which ban any weapons transfer involving North Korea and required member states not to issue work permits to North Koreans.",
      "In its closed-door briefing to lawmakers on April 30, South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service said that Russia had given North Korea air defense missiles, electronic warfare equipment, drones and technology for spy satellite launches. The NIS said that 15,000 North Korean laborers have also been sent to Russia under bilateral industrial cooperation programs, according to lawmakers who attended the briefing.",

      "LeBron James may be daydreaming about Prime Day deals in his new Amazon commercial, but there\u2019s no fantasy when it comes to his real-life focus: getting his knee healthy in time for training camp",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 LeBron James may be daydreaming about Prime Day deals in his new Amazon commercial, but there\u2019s no fantasy when it comes to his real-life focus: getting his knee healthy in time for training camp.",
      "The Los Angeles Lakers superstar plans to return for his 23rd NBA season, which would make him the first player in league history to reach that milestone. But before he steps back on the court, James is prioritizing rest and recovery after he sustained a knee injury in the final game of the Lakers' playoff run.",
      "James, 40, said his left knee is feeling \u201cgood\u201d after spraining a ligament in April, following the Lakers season-ending loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. He emphasized that maintaining his body \u2014 through disciplined eating and training routines \u2014 remains essential to performing at the highest level.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of time to take care of my injury, my knee, the rest of my body and make sure I\u2019m as close to 100% as possible when training camp begins in late September,\u201d James told The Associated Press. He spoke during an interview about starring in a new 60-second commercial called \u201cWhat's Next?,\u201d which announces the July 8-11 Prime Day dates as part of a global \u201cGreatness is a Deal Away\u201d campaign.",
      "These days, James has built a wide-reaching partnership with Amazon, launching his men's grooming line and hosting the \u201cMind the Game\u201d podcast alongside NBA legend Steve Nash through Wondery.",
      "In the commercial, James is asked whether the retirement rumors are true, but his attention drifts toward the deals. While the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer might be tempted by discounts, he\u2019s far from done with the game. He still thrives on the daily grind \u2014 including practices, film sessions and shootarounds \u2014 and hasn\u2019t lost the hunger to compete.",
      "A major reason he continues to push forward? Family. James credits the unwavering support of his wife, Savannah, and their three kids as a driving force. He\u2019s inspired by the chance to share the court with his oldest son, Bronny, who plays for the Lakers; to watch Bryce begin his college journey at the University of Arizona; and to cheer on Zhuri as she pursues volleyball.",
      "The best thing about his children is they've never pressured him to end his career, said James, who has a player option for next season that will pay him more than $56.2 million. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points per game along with 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds and was an All-NBA selection.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re like \u2018Dad, continue on your dream. This is your dream. Continue on your focus. You\u2019ve been here for us this whole time,'\" he continued. \"When you have that type of support... it makes it a lot easier.\u201d",
      "James knows the end of his legendary career is coming, but he\u2019s just not sure when. He said it would be \u201cinsane\u201d if he stuck around long enough to play with his son, Bryce, who would be draft eligible in 2026.",
      "\u201cAt this point of my career, you think about when the end is. That\u2019s human nature,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think: Is it this year? Or next year? Those thoughts always creep into your mind at this point of the journey. But I have not given it a specific timetable, date. I\u2019m seeing how my body and family reacts, too.\u201d",

      "The evacuation warning was for a part of Tehran that houses the country\u2019s state TV and police headquarters and three large hospitals, including one owned by Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was returning from the G7 summit in Canada a day early due to the intensifying conflict.",

      "Russian luge athletes have been excluded from competing at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics even as individuals with neutral status",
      "Russian luge athletes will be banned from competing at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics even as individuals with neutral status, the sliding sport's governing body decided Wednesday.",
      "The International Luge Federation has kept Russian athletes from competing in major international luge events \u2014 such as World Cups and world championships \u2014 since the 2021-22 season in response to the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war.",
      "At a meeting of the FIL congress in Tampere, Finland, officials voted 24-7, with one invalid ballot, to extend that ban that was first put in place in 2022 and extended again in 2024. A second vote then took place on the notion of letting Russian sliders try to compete under a neutral flag at the upcoming Olympics; that was defeated 24-8.",
      "\u201cThe Congress has made its position clear,\u201d FIL president Einars Fogelis said. \u201cThis outcome reflects our collective responsibility to uphold fair and safe competition. We fully respect the diversity of views within our community, especially from our athletes.\u201d",
      "The Milan-Cortina Olympics open on Feb. 6.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation will follow luge's lead. Russian sliders have also not competed in those sports at the top international levels since the end of the 2021-22 season.",
      "Also unclear: if any Russian sleds would have had a legitimate hope of qualifying even if they were allowed to try. Without being on the circuits in more than three years, it\u2019s impossible to assess which athletes would be competitive enough to secure Olympic bids.",
      "There were 28 sliders from Russia \u2014 10 in luge, six in skeleton and 12 in bobsled \u2014 at the 2022 Beijing Games, though they competed under the Russian Olympic Committee flag and not the actual Russian flag. That was part of the sanctions levied against Russia for the state-sponsored doping scandal that overshadowed the 2014 Sochi Olympics.",
      "The Beijing Games closed four days before the attack on Ukraine started, and Russian athlete Tatyana Ivanova won a bronze medal in women's singles luge.",
      "At the 2024 Paris Olympics, Russia and military ally Belarus were excluded from team sports but athletes in individual sports could apply for neutral status to compete. A total of 32 accepted invitations from the International Olympic Committee after passing eligibility tests that included not publicly supporting the war and not having ties to military and state security agencies.",
      "The FIL reviewed the results of an anonymous polling of luge athletes who were surveyed about the prospect of letting Russian athletes resume sliding. It said the survey \u201crevealed a broad range of concerns and opinions regarding safety, Olympic quotas, anti-doping compliance, and fairness.\u201d",
      "\u201cAthletes hold a wide range of views,\u201d FIL athletes\u2019 commission chair Leon Felderer said. \u201cThere are many concerns and arguments on both sides.\u201d",

      "The head of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency told senators that Chinese swimmers would have had to eat around 11 pounds (5 kilograms) of food to test for the amounts of the performance enhancer that resulted in the much-debated positive drug tests from 2021 that were later disregarded.",
      "\u201cIt's unbelievable to think that Tinkerbell just showed up and sprinkled it all over the kitchen,\u201d Travis Tygart said in a Senate hearing Tuesday focused on the World Anti-Doping Agency's response to the doping case.",
      "A key part of that case was WADA's acceptance of the explanation from Chinese authorities that the swimmers had been contaminated by traces of the drug Trimetazidine (TMZ) in a hotel kitchen.",
      "USADA scientists analyzed data from a report commissioned by WADA to come up with the amount of food (5 kilos) or liquid (4.9 liters) the athletes would have had to have consumed to test positive at the levels they did.",
      "WADA officials declined to participate in the hearing, which spokesperson James Fitzgerald called \u201canother political effort led by Travis Tygart ... to leverage the Senate and the media in a desperate effort to relitigate the Chinese swimming cases and misinform athletes and other stakeholders.\u201d",
      "Also testiying was former U.S. drug czar, Rahul Gupta, whose decision at the start of this year to withhold $3.6 million in funding \u2014 the biggest single chunk that WADA receives on an annual basis \u2014 furthered a long-running feud between U.S. and WADA authorities.",
      "The Senate subcommittee holding the hearing is considering a bill that would give the head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy \u2014 the so-called drug czar \u2014 permanent authority to withhold those funds, without needing year-to-year permission from Congress.",
      "In his prepared testimony, Gupta compared WADA's governance challenges to a used car.",
      "\u201cYou expect that the car has been thoroughly inspected, that it\u2019s safe and roadworthy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as soon as you drive it off the lot, the brakes fail and the engine sputters \u2014 and only then do you learn that the dealership has a history of skipping inspections altogether.\u201d",
      "Gupta and Tygart recommended a host of reforms for WADA, most of which revolve around ensuring independence, which they say cannot be accomplished under the current model that calls on the International Olympic Committee to supply half of WADA's money.",
      "Gupta also pressed for the United States to regain a seat on WADA's executive committee that it lost in the aftermath of the dues flareup.",
      "Also testifying was Katie McLaughlin, a member of the U.S. 4x200 freestyle team that won a silver medal at the 2021 Olympics. The Americans finished second to a Chinese team that had two swimmers whose positives were erased after WADA declined to look further into the contamination case.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating, honestly,\u201d McLaughlin said of hearing the news about the doping case. \u201cI was taken aback and heartbroken. I spent a lot of my career trusting in the powers that be, and it was really sad to find out that's someone who could not be trusted, meaning WADA.\u201d",
      "The investigator WADA hired to look into the Chinese doping case ruled that WADA had acted reasonably in not pursuing the Chinese case but still called it \u201ccurious\u201d that the agency did not further pursue facts that didn't line up with the normal handling of contamination cases.",
      "Fitzgerald, the WADA spokesperson, said the agency did, in fact, address some of the concerns in the report, especially about the way contaminations cases are handled.",
      "\u201cAs highlighted by the Chinese cases and many others, the issue of contamination is real and growing and it is crucial that WADA and its partners address it head on,\u201d he said.",
      "Tygart led off his testimony claiming the Chinese case had potentially impacted 96 medals from the 2021 and 2024 Olympics.",
      "WADA argued with that, with Fitzgerald reiterating the agency's long-held legal position that, given the complexities of the evidence, had it taken appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, it would have lost all of them.",

    "story": [
      "Bangladesh piled up a mammoth 484 for nine on a rain-curtailed day 2 of the first Test in Galle against Sri Lanka",
      "GALLE, Sri Lanka -- Bangladesh rode on the broad shoulders of their veteran Mushfiqur Rahim to pile up a mammoth 484 for nine on a rain-curtailed day 2 of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle.",
      "It is their fourth highest total in the longer format against Sri Lanka.",
      "On a pitch that\u2019s expected to break up, Mushfiqur dug in deep putting together a masterful 163 that lasted more than eight hours. He faced 350 deliveries, blending granite-like defense with the occasional flourish to lead the charge.",
      "The old warhorse stitched together two crucial stands that wrested the momentum away from the hosts. First came a record-breaking 264-run partnership with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, who looked in sublime touch during his knock of 148. Shanto, though, fell against the run of play \u2014 lured into a false stroke by Asitha Fernando and holing out to Angelo Mathews at mid-off, a sharp catch.",
      "Undeterred, Mushfiqur then forged another valuable stand \u2014 this time worth 149 runs \u2014 with the free-spirited Litton Das, whose shot-making added zip to the innings. However, both set batters were dismissed in the space of nine deliveries just as they threatened to push Bangladesh past 500.",
      "Sri Lanka resorted to bowling a negative line, peppering the leg-side and starving the batters of scoring opportunities. It was a tactic born of desperation, but it bore fruit. Das was dismissed trying to reverse sweep debutant Tharindu Rathnayake \u2014 the top edge ballooning to the keeper.",
      "The old ball started reverse swinging and brought some late cheer for the hosts. Milan Rathnayake, the bustling right-arm seamer, picked up three wickets in a post-tea spell as Bangladesh lost five wickets for 26 runs \u2014 a collapse that gave Sri Lanka some hope.",
      "Fernando, fresh off a county stint in the UK with Glamorgan, returned three wickets as well. Though not operating at full throttle following a recent illness, he showed why he\u2019s Sri Lanka\u2019s pace spearhead, mixing up sharp bouncers with pinpoint yorkers to good effect.",
      "Rathnayake, the debutant, had three scalps to his name, but the biggest letdown was Prabath Jayasuriya. The usually reliable left-arm spinner toiled for 48 wicketless overs, finding neither bite nor bounce on a surface that usually suits him.",
      "Despite Sri Lanka\u2019s late fightback, the day \u2014 and perhaps the match \u2014 belonged to Mushfiqur. His love affair with Galle continues to bloom, with 482 runs in four innings at the venue. Only Pakistan\u2019s Younis Khan (497) and Australia\u2019s Usman Khawaja (490) have scored more at the ground among visiting batters.",
      "For a side that\u2019s beaten Sri Lanka just once in 26 previous Test attempts, Bangladesh have finally found themselves in the driver\u2019s seat. If their bowlers can now hit the right lengths and apply scoreboard pressure, they might just achieve something special in Galle.",

      "The Yankees have been blanked in three consecutive games seven times in their 123-year history \u2014 but only three times in the last 50 years, most recently from Sept. 22-24, 2016.",
      "The last major league team to get shut out in four straight games was the Kansas City Royals in September 2017.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit foreign for us to go through this for a few days,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.",
      "New York has lost five in a row and mustered only five runs in its past six games, including a 1-0 win last Thursday in Kansas City. The last time the Yankees scored five runs or fewer in a six-game span was August 1968.",
      "In the past six games, New York is batting .164.",
      "Giancarlo Stanton is 4 for 8 in his first two games since returning from injuries to both elbows. But lineup mainstays Bellinger (.152 in his last eight games), Paul Goldschmidt (.164 in his last 17 games) and Aaron Judge (.125 in his last seven games) are all mired in extended slumps.",
      "Judge, who began the night leading the American League in all three Triple Crown categories, was booed following strikeouts in the sixth and eighth innings.",
      "Boone tinkered with his lineup \u2014 batting rookie Jasson Dom\u00ednguez first and dropping Goldschmidt to sixth \u2014 but it didn\u2019t yield results for the Yankees, who were limited to four hits and got just three runners to second base against Kyle Hendricks and a trio of relievers.",
      "Boone implored the Yankees to remain patient at the plate but acknowledged they might have been pressing Tuesday, when they went up against the soft-tossing Hendricks on an unseasonably cool 67-degree night.",
      "\u201cYou want to be the guy (to) kind of get the hit, get it going,\u201d Boone said. \u201cBut that\u2019s where the patience comes in and that\u2019s where just you can\u2019t obsess on the result. You can\u2019t go up there (like) \u2018I gotta get a hit, I gotta do this.\u2019 It\u2019s got to be, \u2018I gotta go take a tough at-bat.\u2019\u201d",
      "Even with the slump, the Yankees still rank among the top five teams in the majors in runs (370), homers (109) and OPS (.784). They finished among the top five in all three categories in five of Boone\u2019s first seven seasons as manager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a little struggle the last couple days, which unfortunately is going to happen,\u201d Boone said. \u201cIt\u2019s just always shocking to see our group not score runs, right? Especially a few days in a row now.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to focus on the little things \u2014 think small, big things come.\u201d",

      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- Sam Bennett won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP on Tuesday night after leading all players in goals scored to help the Florida Panthers win a second consecutive Stanley Cup championship.",
      "Bennett scored 15 goals during a postseason run that culminated with a victory in Game 6 of the final against the Edmonton Oilers. He finished ahead of teammate Brad Marchand in the voting.",
      "\u201cThe amount of guys that stepped up this year and had incredible years, incredible playoff runs, it truly could have went to anyone,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful. It\u2019s such a huge honor, but I truly mean that: It could\u2019ve went to anyone, and I couldn\u2019t have done it without my teammates.\u201d",
      "Bennett was a factor throughout the playoffs making big hits, crowding the crease and knocking opponents off their game. He drew anger from the Toronto Maple Leafs after he elbowed goaltender Anthony Stolarz during Game 1 in the second round and he was a frequent presence in front of Edmonton goalies Stuart Skinner and Calvin Pickard.",
      "\u201cEveryone looks at the goals and rightfully so, but it\u2019s everything he does, even away from the puck,\" teammate Seth Jones said. \u201cHis physical presence out there, his 200-foot game, the way he plays away from the puck defensively, how he is on face-offs, I think it\u2019s the complete package we\u2019re lucky to have. It\u2019s been a big part of our success. He puts a lot of teams, a lot of defensemen on their heels out there.\u201d",
      "Bennett's game traveled, too. In Game 2 against Edmonton, he scored his 12th road goal of 2025 to set an NHL record.",
      "Bennett could parlay his massive postseason success into a lucrative contract as a free agent whether he re-signs with Florida or goes elsewhere. The 28-year-old said it has \u201cactually been pretty easy\u201d to set aside his pending free agency and uncertain future.",
      "\u201cCompeting for a Stanley Cup has always been my goal and my passion, and what I\u2019ve wanted to do,\u201d Bennett said before Game 6. \u201cThat\u2019s just my focus. That\u2019s all I want, and it\u2019s been quite easy to just not even think about what\u2019s to come. I mean, yeah, it\u2019s really just a singular focus and that\u2019s how I\u2019ve tried to handle it.\u201d",
      "Bennett contributed to back-to-back goals in Game 1 by standing in front of and falling onto Skinner, and he made a big hit on Vasily Podkolzin and scored seconds later in Florida's Game 3 victory. All series, he was in the middle of the action.",
      "\u201cPhysical player, incredible speed and then the hands to finish,\u201d coach Paul Maurice said.",
      "In a lot of ways, Bennett embodies Panthers hockey: hard-nosed, tough, willing to mix it up and also skilled enough to take advantage of mistakes.",
      "\u201cHe does it all \u2014 it\u2019s fun to watch,\u201d fourth-liner Jonah Gadjovich said. \u201cHe's throwing huge hits, he\u2019s playing hard defensively, working pucks in the corners, getting to the net, and obviously scoring a ton of goals. ... He\u2019s one of the leaders on the team, someone that we can all get behind.\u201d",

      "So do the Panthers.",
      "It's why Florida never appeared rattled during its third straight Stanley Cup Final run. The defending champion Panthers remained even-keeled, never looking too far ahead, and certainly not harping on the past \u2014 mirroring the attitude of their unflappable, two-time Vezina Trophy-winning goaltender.",
      "And Bobrovsky has rewarded their trust in him with a brilliant showing in this year's playoffs, which he stamped with a 28-save effort Tuesday in Florida's 5-1 romp over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6 to win their second straight title.",
      "He stopped 192 of 209 shots on goal in the final and allowed 17 goals. He nearly had his fourth shutout of the postseason before Vasily Podkolzin broke up that bid with the Oilers' only goal Tuesday with just 4:39 left.",
      "With Tuesday's win, Bobrovsky moved to 13-8 in 22 series-clinching games in his career, tying Tampa Bay's Andrei Vasilevskiy (13-9) for the most among active goaltenders.",
      "He was even more dominant than last year's title run, when he was again a key piece in Florida\u2019s success with a .906 save percentage.",
      "Ask Florida's veteran goaltender what he thinks of his success and he will likely sum it up in a few words. He'll express his gratitude and talk about how great it is to play the game he loves. Then he will deflect the attention to his teammates.",
      "That's who he's been since he took the starting job three games into the first round in 2023 and what the Panthers have come to appreciate about him. He's been the calming presence in their locker room amid all kinds of chaos during this dominant three-year run.",
      "His focus is always on what it takes to win and his credit always goes to the ones around him.",
      "That simple approach has worked for him.",
      "Going back to the 2023 playoffs, no goalie has more wins, saves or shutouts than Bobrovsky. He's the second-oldest goaltender in the last decade with a playoff shutout.",
      "Entering Tuesday, only three other goalies since 1981-82 had won the Vezina Trophy twice and hoisted the Stanley Cup trophy multiple times.",
      "Bobrovsky joined that group on Tuesday.",

      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Salvador Perez homered twice, Bobby Witt Jr. went deep in his hometown team's ballpark for the first time and the Kansas City Royals stopped a six-game losing streak with a 6-1 victory over the Texas Rangers on Tuesday night.",
      "Seth Lugo struck out a season-high nine for his first win since May 1 as all three active Kansas City All-Stars from last year's Midsummer Classic at Globe Life Field returned to Texas and had a hand in ending the team's five-game skid against the Rangers.",
      "Lugo (4-5), who threw a scoreless inning in the American League's 5-3 victory last July, gave up three hits and a run over six innings in his return to Arlington.",
      "With the Royals coming off an 0-6 homestand that matched their longest losing streak of the season, Perez hit a two-run shot for a 3-0 lead in the first inning. After adding an RBI double in the fourth, Perez connected for his eighth homer of the year, a solo shot that made it 6-1 in the sixth.",
      "Witt also homered off Jack Leiter in a matchup between sons of former major league pitchers. Witt grew up in the Dallas area, where Bobby Witt settled after spending 11 of his 16 big league seasons with the Rangers.",
      "Leiter (4-4) is the son of Al Leiter, who had a 19-year major league career. The rookie right-hander gave up eight hits and six runs \u2014 both matching season highs \u2014 in 5 2/3 innings.",
      "The Rangers equaled their season high by striking out 14 times.",
      "Texas rookie Alejandro Osuna had his first career RBI in the fourth.",
      "Perez had his 18th multihomer game, breaking George Brett's franchise record.",

      "Amazon is gearing up to make as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo",
      "HAYWARD, Calif. -- Amazon is gearing up to make as many as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also vying to join the autonomous race.",
      "The 220,000-square-foot (20,440-square-meters) robotaxi factory announced Wednesday heralds a new phase in Amazon's push into a technological frontier that began taking shape in 2009, when Waymo was launched as a secret project within Google.",
      "Amazon began eyeing the market five years ago when it shelled out $1.2 billion for self-driving startup Zoox, which will be the brand behind a robotaxi service that plans to begin transporting customers in Las Vegas late this year before expanding into San Francisco next year.",
      "Zoox, conceived in 2014, will be trying to catch up to Waymo, which began operating robotaxis in Phoenix nearly five years ago then charging for rides in San Francisco in 2023 before expanding into Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. Waymo says it has already more than 10 million paid rides while other would-be rivals such as Amazon and Tesla are still fine-tuning their self-driving technology while tackling other challenges, such how to ramp up their fleet.",
      "Amazon feels like has addressed that issue with Zoox's manufacturing plant that spans across the equivalent of three-and-a-half football fields located in Hayward, California \u2014 about 17 miles (27 kilometers) north of a factory where Tesla makes some of the electric vehicles that Musk believes will eventually be able to operate without a driver behind the wheel.",
      "Since moving into the former bus manufacturing factory in 2023, Zoox has transformed it into a high-tech facility where its boxy, gondola-like vehicles are put together and tested along a 21-station assembly line. For now, Zoox is only making one robotaxi per day, but by next year hopes to be churning them out at the rate of three vehicles per hour.",
      "By 2027, Zoox hopes to making 10,000 robotaxis annually in Hayward for a fleet that it hopes to take into other major markets, including Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Although Zoox will be assembling its robotaxis in the U.S., about half of the parts are imported from outside the country, according to company officials.",
      "\u201cIt's an exciting time to be heading on this journey,\u201d Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said during a Tuesday tour of the robotaxi factory that she co-hosted with Jesse Levinson, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer.",
      "Although Zoox will be lagging well behind, it believes it can lure passengers with vehicles that look more like carriages that cars with seating for up to four passengers. Waymo, in contrast, builds its self-driving technology on to cars made by other major automakers, making its robotaxi look similar to vehicles steered by humans. Zoox isn't even bothering to put a steering wheel in its robotaxis.",
      "As it continues to test its robotaxis in Las Vegas, Zoox recently struck a partnership to give rides to guests of Reorts World. It's also still testing its robotaxis in San Francisco, where Waymo already has turned driverless cars into an everyday site in a city that has been renowned for cable cars since the 1870s. While testing in San Francisco last month, a minor collision between a Zoox robotaxi and a person riding an electric scooter last month prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall to update its self-driving technology. No injuries were reported in the incident.",
      "Tesla is still angling to compete against Waymo too, although it remains unclear when Musk will fuflil his long-running promise to build the world's largest robotaxi service. Musk still hasn't given up on the goal, though his current ambitions are more modest than they were in 2019. when he predicted Tesla would be running a fleet of 1 million robotaxis by now. He is currently aiming for a limited rollout of Tesla robotaxis in Austin this Sunday, although that date could change because Musk is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d",
      "Zoox, in contrast, is planning to operate 500 to 1,000 of its robotaxis in small to medium-sized markets and about 2,000 robotaxis in major cities where it eventually operates, according to Evans. The company thinks each robotaxi produced in its Hayward plan should be on the road for about five years, or about 500,000 miles",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Humans are the only animal that lives in virtually every possible environment, from rainforests to deserts to tundra.",
      "This adaptability is a skill that long predates the modern age. According to a new study published Wednesday in Nature, ancient Homo sapiens developed the flexibility to survive by finding food and other resources in a wide variety of difficult habitats before they dispersed from Africa about 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cOur superpower is that we are ecosystem generalists,\u201d said Eleanor Scerri, an evolutionary archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.",
      "Our species first evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. While prior fossil finds show some groups made early forays outside the continent, lasting human settlements in other parts of the world didn't happen until a series of migrations around 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat was different about the circumstance of the migrations that succeeded \u2014 why were humans ready this time?\u201d said study co-author Emily Hallett, an archaeologist at Loyola University Chicago.",
      "Earlier theories held that Stone Age humans might have made a single important technological advance or developed a new way of sharing information, but researchers haven\u2019t found evidence to back that up.",
      "This study took a different approach by looking at the trait of flexibility itself.",
      "The scientists assembled a database of archaeological sites showing human presence across Africa from 120,000 to 14,000 years ago. For each site, researchers modeled what the local climate would have been like during the time periods that ancient humans lived there.",
      "\u201cThere was a really sharp change in the range of habitats that humans were using starting around 70,000 years ago,\u201d Hallet said. \u201cWe saw a really clear signal that humans were living in more challenging and more extreme environments.\u201d",
      "While humans had long survived in savanna and forests, they shifted into everything from from dense rainforests to arid deserts in the period leading up to 50,000 years ago, developing what Hallet called an \"ecological flexibility that let them succeed.\u201d",
      "While this leap in abilities is impressive, it\u2019s important not to assume that only Homo sapiens did it, said University of Bordeaux archaeologist William Banks, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Other groups of early human ancestors also left Africa and established long-term settlements elsewhere, including those that evolved into Europe\u2019s Neanderthals, he said.",
      "The new research helps explain why humans were ready to expand across the world way back when, he said, but it doesn\u2019t answer the lasting question of why only our species remains today.",

      "NEW YORK -- An Australian moth follows the stars during its yearly migration, using the night sky as a guiding compass, according to a new study.",
      "When temperatures heat up, nocturnal Bogong moths fly about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to cool down in caves by the Australian Alps. They later return home to breed and die.",
      "Birds routinely navigate by starlight, but the moths are the first known invertebrates, or creatures without a backbone, to find their way across such long distances using the stars.",
      "Scientists have long wondered how the moths travel to a place they've never been. A previous study hinted that Earth's magnetic field might help steer them in the right direction, along with some kind of visual landmark as a guide.",
      "Since stars appear in predictable patterns each night, scientists suspected they might help lead the way. They placed moths in a flight simulator that mimicked the night sky above them and blocked out the Earth's magnetic field, noting where they flew. Then they scrambled the stars and saw how the moths reacted.",
      "When the stars were as they should be, the moths flapped in the right direction. But when the stars were in random places, the moths were disoriented. Their brain cells also got excited in response to specific orientations of the night sky.",
      "The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "It \u201cwas a very clean, impressive demonstration that the moths really are using a view of the night sky to guide their movements,\u201d said Kenneth Lohmann, who studies animal navigation at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was not involved with the new research.",
      "Researchers don't know what features of the night sky the moths use to find their way. It could be a stripe of light from the Milky Way, a colorful nebula or something else entirely. Whatever it is, the insects seem to rely on that along with Earth's magnetic field to make their journey.",
      "Other animals harness the stars as a guide. Birds take celestial cues as they soar through the skies and dung beetles roll their remains short distances while using the Milky Way to stay on course.",
      "It's an impressive feat for Bogong moths whose brains are smaller than size of a grain of rice to rely on the night sky for their odyssey, said study author David Dreyer with Lund University in Sweden.",

      "Several eruptions sent ash up to 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) into the sky Tuesday evening to Wednesday afternoon.

      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has sued to try to stop New York from requiring reports on how social media platforms define and handle problematic posts",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk \u2019s X sued Tuesday to try to stop New York from requiring reports on how social media platforms handle problematic posts \u2014 a regulatory approach that the company successfully challenged in California.",
      "New York's law, which Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed late last year, is poised to take effect later this year. X maintains that the measure impinges on free speech rights and on a 1996 federal law that, among other things, lets internet platforms moderate posts as they see fit.",
      "New York is improperly trying \u201cto inject itself into the content-moderation editorial process\u201d by requiring \u201cpolitically charged disclosures\u201d about it, Bastrop, Texas-based X Corp. argues in the suit.",
      "\u201cThe state is impermissibly trying to generate public controversy about content moderation in a way that will pressure social media companies, such as X Corp., to restrict, limit, disfavor or censor certain constitutionally protected content on X that the state dislikes,\u201d says the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.",
      "The law requires social media companies to report twice a year on whether and how they define hate speech, racist or extremist content, disinformation and some other terms. The platforms also have to detail their content moderation practices and data on the number of posts they flagged, the actions they took, the extent to which the offending material was seen or shared, and more.",
      "Sponsors Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Grace Lee, both Democrats, have said the measure will make social media more transparent and companies more accountable.",
      "The law applies broadly to social media companies. But X is among those that have faced intense scrutiny in recent years, and in a 2024 letter to an X lobbyist, the sponsors said the company and Musk in particular have a \u201cdisturbing record\u201d that \u201cthreatens the foundations of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The lawmakers wrote before Musk became, for a time, a close adviser and chainsaw-wielding cost-cutter in Republican President Donald Trump's administration. The two billionaires have since feuded and, perhaps, made up.",
      "Since taking over the former Twitter in 2022, Musk, in the name of free speech, has dismantled the company\u2019s Trust and Safety advisory group and stopped enforcing content moderation and hate speech rules that the site followed. He has restored the accounts of conspiracy theorists and incentivized engagement on the platform with payouts and content partnerships.",
      "Outside groups have since documented a rise in hate speech and harassment on the platform. X sued a research organization that studies online hate speech \u2013 that lawsuit was dismissed last March.",
      "The New York legislation took a page from a similar law that passed in California \u2014 and drew a similar lawsuit from X.",
      "Last fall, a panel of federal appellate judges blocked portions of the California law, at least temporarily, on free speech grounds. The state subsequently settled, agreeing not to enforce the content-moderation reporting requirements.",

      "A proposal by Senate Republicans would adjust the pace at which some crucial home energy efficiency and electric vehicle tax credits are phased out in timelines different from what House Republicans proposed in the multitrillion-dollar tax bill they pa...",
      "Tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, albeit less quickly, under Senate Republicans' latest proposed changes to a massive tax bill. Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.",
      "Senate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.",
      "Ultimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.",
      "\u201cThey want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.\u201d",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electric companies, issued a statement applauding the Senate proposal for including \u201cmore reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese modifications are a step in the right direction,\u201d said the statement from Pat Vincent-Collawn, the institute\u2019s interim chief executive officer, adding that the changes balance \u201cbusiness certainty with fiscal responsibility.\u201d",
      "Whether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.",
      "Notably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.",
      "The clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "The House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.",
      "Language included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.",
      "The Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.",
      "On the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.",
      "At the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.",
      "\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.",
      "\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House\u2019s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cCanceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,\u201d Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.",
      "The Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.",
      "This administration has staunchly gone after EVs amid Trump's targeting of what he calls a \u201cmandate,\u201d incorrectly referring to a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales by 2030 be electric.",

      "Built by Alameda, California-based company Saildrone, the vessels will patrol Danish and NATO waters in the Baltic and North Seas, where maritime tensions and suspected sabotage have escalated sharply since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Powered by wind and solar energy, these sea drones can operate autonomously for months at sea. Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",

      "A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses through precise and fancy formation flying",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses by flying in precise and fancy formation, providing hours of on-demand totality for scientists.",
      "The European Space Agency released the eclipse pictures at the Paris Air Show on Monday. Launched late last year, the orbiting duo have churned out simulated solar eclipses since March while zooming tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth.",
      "Flying 492 feet (150 meters) apart, one satellite blocks the sun like the moon does during a natural total solar eclipse as the other aims its telescope at the corona, the sun's outer atmosphere that forms a crown or halo of light.",
      "It's an intricate, prolonged dance requiring extreme precision by the cube-shaped spacecraft, less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) in size. Their flying accuracy needs to be within a mere millimeter, the thickness of a fingernail. This meticulous positioning is achieved autonomously through GPS navigation, star trackers, lasers and radio links.",
      "Dubbed Proba-3, the $210 million mission has generated 10 successful solar eclipses so far during the ongoing checkout phase. The longest eclipse lasted five hours, said the Royal Observatory of Belgium's Andrei Zhukov, the lead scientist for the orbiting corona-observing telescope. He and his team are aiming for a wondrous six hours of totality per eclipse once scientific observations begin.",
      "Scientists already are thrilled by the preliminary results that show the corona without the need for any special image processing, said Zhukov.",
      "\"We almost couldn\u2019t believe our eyes,\u201d Zhukov said in an email. \u201cThis was the first try, and it worked. It was so incredible.\u201d",
      "Zhukov anticipates an average of two solar eclipses per week being produced for a total of nearly 200 during the two-year mission, yielding more than 1,000 hours of totality. That will be a scientific bonanza since full solar eclipses produce just a few minutes of totality when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun \u2014 on average just once every 18 months.",
      "The sun continues to mystify scientists, especially its corona, which is hotter than the solar surface. Coronal mass ejections result in billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields being hurled out into space. Geomagnetic storms can result, disrupting power and communication while lighting up the night sky with auroras in unexpected locales.",
      "While previous satellites have generated imitation solar eclipses \u2014 including the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter and Soho observatory \u2014 the sun-blocking disk was always on the same spacecraft as the corona-observing telescope. What makes this mission unique, Zhukov said, is that the sun-shrouding disk and telescope are on two different satellites and therefore far apart.",
      "The distance between these two satellites will give scientists a better look at the part of the corona closest to the limb of the sun.",
      "\"We are extremely satisfied by the quality of these images, and again this is really thanks to formation flying\u201d with unprecedented accuracy, ESA\u2019s mission manager Damien Galano said from the Paris Air Show.",

      "A new poll finds Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his public falling-out with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers \u2014 notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.",
      "Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands.",
      "Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business.",
      "And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021.",
      "\u201cMy government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.\u201d",

      "Meta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing \u201csuperintelligence\u201d at the tech giant.",
      "The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.",
      "Meta announced what it called a \u201cstrategic partnership and investment\u201d with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.",
      "Scale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will \u201csubstantially expand Scale and Meta\u2019s commercial relationship.\u201d Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.",
      "Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.",
      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.",
      "Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.",

      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams.

It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",
      "Wang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",

      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",
      "\u201cBut now we are realizing they are also shaping the ecosystems by producing and spreading information,\u201d she said.",

      "Everything ever said on the internet was just the start of teaching artificial intelligence about humanity",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Everything ever said on the internet was just the start of teaching artificial intelligence about humanity. Tech companies are now tapping into an older repository of knowledge: the library stacks.",
      "Nearly one million books published as early as the 15th century \u2014 and in 254 languages \u2014 are part of a Harvard University collection being released to AI researchers Thursday. Also coming soon are troves of old newspapers and government documents held by Boston's public library.",
      "Cracking open the vaults to centuries-old tomes could be a data bonanza for tech companies battling lawsuits from living novelists, visual artistsand others whose creative works have been scooped up without their consent to train AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cIt is a prudent decision to start with public domain data because that\u2019s less controversial right now than content that\u2019s still under copyright,\u201d said Burton Davis, a deputy general counsel at Microsoft.",
      "Davis said libraries also hold \u201csignificant amounts of interesting cultural, historical and language data\u201d that's missing from the past few decades of online commentary that AI chatbots have mostly learned from.",
      "Supported by \u201cunrestricted gifts\u201d from Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the Harvard-based Institutional Data Initiative is working with libraries around the world on how to make their historic collections AI-ready in a way that also benefits libraries and the communities they serve.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move some of the power from this current AI moment back to these institutions,\u201d said Aristana Scourtas, who manages research at Harvard Law School\u2019s Library Innovation Lab. \u201cLibrarians have always been the stewards of data and the stewards of information.\u201d",
      "Harvard's newly released dataset, Institutional Books 1.0, contains more than 394 million scanned pages of paper. One of the earlier works is from the 1400s \u2014 a Korean painter\u2019s handwritten thoughts about cultivating flowers and trees. The largest concentration of works is from the 19th century, on subjects such as literature, philosophy, law and agriculture, all of it meticulously preserved and organized by generations of librarians.",
      "It promises to be a boon for AI developers trying to improve the accuracy and reliability of their systems.",
      "\u201cA lot of the data that\u2019s been used in AI training has not come from original sources,\u201d said the data initiative's executive director, Greg Leppert, who is also chief technologist at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. This book collection goes \"all the way back to the physical copy that was scanned by the institutions that actually collected those items,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ChatGPT sparked a commercial AI frenzy, most AI researchers didn\u2019t think much about the provenance of the passages of text they pulled from Wikipedia, from social media forums like Reddit and sometimes from deep repositories of pirated books. They just needed lots of what computer scientists call tokens \u2014 units of data, each of which can represent a piece of a word.",
      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",
      "Meta is also battling a lawsuit from comedian Sarah Silverman and other published authors who accuse the company of stealing their books from \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated works.",
      "Now, with some reservations, the real libraries are standing up.",
      "OpenAI, which is also fighting a string of copyright lawsuits, donated $50 million this year to a group of research institutions including Oxford University's 400-year-old Bodleian Library, which is digitizing rare texts and using AI to help transcribe them.",
      "When the company first reached out to the Boston Public Library, one of the biggest in the U.S., the library made clear that any information it digitized would be for everyone, said Jessica Chapel, its chief of digital and online services.",
      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",
      "A book collection steeped in 19th century thought could also be \u201cimmensely critical\u201d for the tech industry's efforts to build AI agents that can plan and reason as well as humans, Leppert said.",
      "\u201cAt a university, you have a lot of pedagogy around what it means to reason,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cYou have a lot of scientific information about how to run processes and how to run analyses.\u201d",
      "At the same time, there's also plenty of outdated data, from debunked scientific and medical theories to racist narratives.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with such a large data set, there are some tricky issues around harmful content and language,\" said Kristi Mukk, a coordinator at Harvard's Library Innovation Lab who said the initiative is trying to provide guidance about mitigating the risks of using the data, to \u201chelp them make their own informed decisions and use AI responsibly.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",

That\u2019s when the idea of the \u201cgolden share\u201d emerged as a way to resolve national security concerns and protect American interests in domestic steel production.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel also made a series of bigger capital commitments in U.S. Steel facilities, tallying $11 billion through 2028, it said.",

      "U.S. officials signaled Tuesday that the next 24 to 48 hours would be critical.",
      "As President Donald Trump huddled with his top advisers in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday, U.S. officials signaled that the next 24 to 48 hours would be critical in determining whether a diplomatic solution with Iran is possible -- or if the president might resort to military action instead.",
      "Trump significantly ramped up his rhetoric against the Iranian regime ahead of the meeting, asserting that the U.S. knew exactly where Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was hiding.",
      "\"He is an easy target, but is safe there -- We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin,\" Trump wrote on social media.",
      "\"We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,\" he claimed in another post.",
      "Despite the apparent saber rattling, U.S. negotiators on Tuesday continued to assess that Iran is in a weak position and could be forced to come back to the negotiating table and to ultimately accept a deal that would require it abandon all nuclear enrichment, according to multiple officials involved in the diplomatic process.",
      "As Iran and Israel trade blows, the Iranian regime has signaled a willingness to resume discussions with the U.S., the officials said, adding that the Trump administration has been looking for more concrete commitments before backing off the war path.",
      "If Iran returns to the negotiations and agrees to drop its uranium enrichment, U.S. officials believe a high-level meeting led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and potentially Vice President JD Vance would happen as soon as this week.",
      "But that scenario likely requires Iran to move quickly. The president has already acknowledged his patience with the situation in the Middle East is wearing thin.",
      "Sources familiar with the president's mindset said he has grown frustrated by a destabilized Iran's inability to provide the administration with immediate answers and also appears highly disinclined to allow for a situation to unfold where it appears as if Tehran has successfully called his military bluff.",
      "The U.S. military is already sending assets toward the region, including sending additional aircraft and a second aircraft carrier and its strike group to the Middle East -- all moves that are defensive in nature, officials say.",
      "\"We're strong, we're prepared, we're defensive and present,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said of the U.S. posture in the Middle East during an interview with Fox News on Monday.",
      "But while the repositioning of assets is intended to protect the 40,000 estimated American troops stationed in the region, it also leaves options open for the Trump administration if it decides to directly assist with Israel's ongoing offensive operation against Iran.",
      "\"It's our role to keep options on the table, but our posture is still defensive,\" said a U.S. official.",
      "A major question is whether the U.S. will deploy its B-2 stealth bombers. The heavy strategic bombers are capable of carrying the 30,000 pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker-buster bombs, which might be able to destroy Iran's deep underground nuclear facility at the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant.",
      "Currently, the military's fleet of 19 B-2 bombers is located at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. Six of the aircraft were previously deployed to the airbase on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean -- much closer to Iran. However, they were replaced by B-52 long-range bombers which are not capable of carrying the bunker-buster bombs needed to destroy the Fordo site.",
      "Already, roughly a dozen U.S. Navy vessels are in Bahrain's territorial waters away from post, according to a Defense Department official, who said that the ships do not have any official tasking. Among them are a littoral combat ship, four minesweepers, and six water patrol craft, the official said.",
      "The Navy also has two destroyers in the Red Sea, an aircraft carrier, and three other surface ships in the Arabian Sea. Two more American destroyers are in the eastern Mediterranean Sea -- each equipped with missile defense systems capable of shooting down Iranian ballistic missiles.",
      "Signs the Trump administration could be inching toward military action could include canceling the president's plans to travel to the Netherlands for a NATO summit next week.",
      "At a press briefing on Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the summit was still \"on the books\" -- but said the situation could change depending on the dynamic with Iran.",
      "\"This is something that is moving -- as things tend to -- very rapidly. So, I would say that anything is possible,\" she said.",
      "Already, the president made an early exit from the G7 summit in Canada, opting to cut his time there short on Monday in order to monitor the situation in the Middle East from the White House.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is returning to Capitol Hill for the last in a series of hearings before lawmakers",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is returning to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for the last in a series of often combative hearings before lawmakers, who have pressed him on everything from a ban on transgender troops to his use of a Signal chat to share sensitive military plans.",
      "The questions \u2014 which also have touched on his firings of top military leaders and even some of his inner circle of advisers \u2014 may be dominated by the escalation of airstrikes between Iran and Israel that threaten a potentially devastating regional war. But he is still expected to face sharp questions about his chaotic tenure, his opposition to women in combat jobs and efforts to shift funding from troop housing to border security.",
      "The U.S. has shifted significant numbers of refueling tanker and fighter aircraft to position them to be able to respond if needed to the conflict, such as possible evacuations or airstrikes. Hegseth said this week that was done to protect U.S. personnel and airbases.",
      "\u201cWe are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that\u2019s what happens here,\" he told Fox News Channel. \u201cAnd America first means we\u2019re going to defend American personnel and American interests.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's testimony last week in three congressional hearings also was taken over by events, with the Trump administration dispatching the National Guard and 700 active-duty Marines to the protests in Los Angeles against California Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes. It came just ahead of a massive military parade to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday, which coincided with President Donald Trump's birthday.",
      "In the previous hearings \u2014 where Hegseth was appearing to discuss the Pentagon's spending plan \u2014 lawmakers made it clear they are unhappy that Hegseth has not provided full details on the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget.",
      "Trump has said it would total $1 trillion, a significant increase over the current spending level of more than $800 billion.",
      "Hegseth, who is appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, has spent vast amounts of time during his first months in office promoting the social changes he\u2019s making at the Pentagon. He\u2019s been far less visible in the administration\u2019s more critical international security crises and negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and Iran.",
      "For example, Hegseth directed the renaming of a Navy ship that had honored Harvey Milk, a slain gay rights activist who served as a sailor during the Korean War. He also has touted other moves to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and said a ban on transgender troops in the military was a way to regain the \u201cwarrior ethos.\u201d",
      "It will be Hegseth's first time before some senators since he squeaked through his Senate confirmation with a tie-breaking vote. It was the closest vote of any Trump Cabinet member.",
      "While he has talked a lot about making the military more lethal, it was his use of the unclassified, unsecured Signal messaging app that quickly caught public attention.",
      "Set up by then-national security adviser Mike Waltz, a group chat that included Hegseth and other senior administration leaders was used to share information about upcoming military strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "The chat came to light because the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to it. Waltz took responsibility for the gaffe, but Hegseth was roundly criticized for sharing details about the military strikes in that chat and in another one that included his wife and brother.",
      "The Pentagon's watchdog is looking into Hegseth's use of Signal and expected to issue a report soon.",

      "His comments come amid an growing divide among Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters",
      "In a lengthy post on X on Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance came to the defense of President Donald Trump after supporters like Tucker Carlson and those in the MAGA base have been outspoken about the U.S. not getting involved in the war between Israel and Iran.",
      "\"First, POTUS has been amazingly consistent, over 10 years, that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Over the last few months, he encouraged his foreign policy team to reach a deal with the Iranians to accomplish this goal,\" Vance wrote on X. \"The president has made clear that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment. And he said repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways--the easy way or the \"other\" way.\"",
      "Vance continued, explaining the difference between \"civilian nuclear power\" and \"uranium enrichment.\" The vice president told his followers that Iran has \"been found in violation of their non-proliferation obligations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\"",
      "\"He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president,\" Vance wrote. \"And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue. And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish American people's goals. Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",
      "Vance's comments come amid a quickly escalating divide among some of Trump's most vocal supporters being led in part by two prominent Trump allies: Trump's longtime adviser Steve Bannon and Carlson, the right-wing commentator -- who continue to speak out against U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.",
      "Bannon went on Carlson's podcast Monday night and warned that further involvement would \"blow up\" the Trump coalition and derail the president's national agenda, particularly on immigration.",
      "\"If we get sucked into this war, which inexorably looks like it's going to happen on the combat side, it's going to not just blow up the coalition, it's also gonna thwart what we're doing with the most important thing, which is the deportation of the illegal alien invaders that are here,\" he said.",
      "Earlier Monday, Carlson appeared on Bannon's show and said the move could lead to \"the end of the American empire\" and could \"effectively\" end Trump's presidency.",
      "Trump swatted down Carlson's comments, calling him \"Kooky\" in a post on Truth Social and telling reporters Carlson should \"get a television network and say it so that people listen.\"",
      "But other leading MAGA voices are weighing in, including an exceedingly rare comment from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene pushing back on Trump's jab at Carlson without naming him, writing in a lengthy post that Carlson's comments regarding Iran are \"not kooky.\"",
      "\"Tucker Carlson is one of my favorite people. He fiercely loves his wife, children, and our country. Since being fired by the neocon network Fox News, he has more popularity and viewers than ever before. He unapologetically believes the same things I do. That if we don't fight for our own country and our own people then we will no longer have a country for our children and our grandchildren. And foreign wars/intervention/regime change put America last, kill innocent people, are making us broke, and will ultimately lead to our destruction. That's not kooky. That's what millions of Americans voted for. It's what we believe is America First,\" she wrote.",
      "Greene also appeared on longtime Trump ally and former Rep. Matt Gaetz's show on Monday, and the pair both urged the president to \"reject\" calls to join the Israel-Iran conflict.",
      "Asked Tuesday on Capitol Hill if his post was directed specifically at conservatives or those who usually support the MAGA movement, Vance said it was \"not targeted at any particular demographic of the country\" and was directed toward \"everybody who is interested.\"",
      "The vice president said he wrote the post to help Americans understand why the administration is so focused on Iran.",
      "\"I just wanted to explain to the American people, if you want safety, part of safety, and I think all Americans want that, is ensuring that the worst people in the world don't have a nuclear bomb. And part of ensuring that they don't have a nuclear bomb is ensuring that they don't have the enrichment capacity to get there. I just kind of wanted to lay that out and sot of explain why we're talking about this issue and why the President is so focused on this question,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance didn't directly answer questions about whether the U.S. will strike Iran as he was leaving a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans about Trump's megabill, but he repeatedly reiterated the president's policy position that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon or enriched uranium.",
      "\"It's so bizarre to me that the Iranians seem confused about what's going on,\" Vance said. \"The president has been as clear as possible for as long as possible that part of his no-nuclear policy is Iranians are not allowed to have enrichment in their country.\"",

      "New Yorkers voting in the city's closely-watched Democratic mayoral primary election on June 24 will be able to rank their top five candidates thanks to ranked-choice voting -- and that's set the scene for candidates on the ballot, who are ostensibly rivals, telling their supporters to vote for each other.",
      "On their ballot, voters can rank up to five candidates in any order. Ranking one candidate in two spots, though, does not give that candidate two votes.",

      "Since voters are able to rank multiple candidates, some candidates have been able to form unusual alliances with each other -- including telling their supporters to rank each other.",
      "Two of the progressive-leaning mayoral candidates \u2013 state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani and city comptroller Brad Lander -- announced on Friday that they are cross-endorsing each other in what they said is an effort to stop former Gov. Andrew Cuomo from winning the race.",
      "\"The core reason, I think, is it it significantly increases the chances of Andrew Cuomo not winning \u2026 If you have somebody leading in the polls, and the number-two and -three candidates agree that that person is unacceptable, teaming up dramatically increases their chances,\" Lander said at an event on Friday with Mamdani.",
      "Sheinkopf said that the cross-endorsements by progressive candidates such as Mamdani and Lander are ultimately meant to limit the amount of votes Cuomo can get, although he feels that the cross-endorsements also amount to \"making deals to win without telling voters what the deals could cost should any of the dealers win.\"",
      "Many organizations have also endorsed multiple candidates, sometimes telling supporters the order in which to rank them. Some organizations, such as the New York Working Families Party, have sounded a similar tone to Lander and Mamdani, saying that voters should rank the group's endorsed candidates and not rank Cuomo at all.",
      "The Cuomo campaign has shrugged off the cross-endorsements and calls from groups to not rank the former governor.",
      "\"We are running our campaign, they are running theirs -- ultimately the voters will decide,\" Esther Jensen, a spokesperson for the Cuomo campaign, told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Cuomo has support from two other mayoral candidates, although they are not cross-endorsements.",
      "Mayoral candidate and state Sen. Jessica Ramos has fully endorsed Cuomo and effectively suspended her campaign, although she will still be on the ballot. Separately, mayoral candidate and former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson said at the second mayoral primary debate that he will rank Cuomo second on his ballot.",
      "On Monday, Mamdani and another former assembly member on the ballot, Michael Blake, also announced that they would cross-endorse each other in the race.",
      "While the primary is Tuesday, June 24, fuller results won't be reported until a week later, on July 1. Instead, the city's election board expects to provide preliminary totals for voters' first-choice votes on June 24 after polls close, and then run the ranked-choice tabulation on July 1.",
      "Part of the delay can be attributed to the complex nature of collecting and tabulating the results of ranked-choice ballots, especially if no candidate crosses the 50% threshold needed to win on the first round. Polls have shown no candidate winning outright on the first round.",
      "A spokesperson for the New York City Board of Elections, Vincent Ignizio, recently told POLITICO, \"We're not going to exchange speed for accuracy.\"",

      "\"It was truly chilling,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "A Sunday evening at home with her children took a dark turn for Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Hillary Scholten when she says state police delivered the horrifying news that she was on a suspected killer's alleged target list.",
      "\"It was truly chilling,\" Scholten told ABC News on Tuesday, describing the moment she says authorities told her she was among 45 people targeted by the suspect accused of killing Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home on Saturday.",
      "The 57-year-old suspected gunman, Vance Boelter, allegedly maintained detailed surveillance notes on his intended victims, including Democratic politicians, abortion-rights advocates and healthcare officials, according to law enforcement sources.",
      "Boelter is also accused of wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Before the fatal shooting at Hortman's home, authorities say he had already attempted to reach two other lawmakers who weren't at their residences.",
      "For Scholten, a mother of two boys, her first instinct was to be protective.",
      "\"As a mom, my first instinct, of course, was to protect my two boys who were at home with me,\" she said.",
      "Scholten told ABC News that local law enforcement responded immediately and stationed troopers outside her home around the clock while the suspect remained at large in a nearby state. She also wants answers to why she was on Boelter's alleged list.",
      "\"You know, I think that's one of the things we're still trying to figure out, and that we are really pushing the FBI and the Capitol Police to get us answers to,\" Scholten said.",
      "\"We will not be intimidated or silenced by an individual like this,\" Scholten said. \"As the first woman in history to do this job, I feel that it is so important to, yes, always be smart and safe, but to continue to push back against this type of violence.\"",
      "While most lawmakers have condemned the shooting. Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee posted images about the suspect with the caption, \"Nightmare on Waltz Street\" -- an apparent reference to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",
      "\"Shame, shame on you. Senator, you know better than that,\" Scholten told ABC News. \"We are talking about a fellow public servant who was killed because of the job that she chose to do; he should immediately take down these horrific and offensive posts and apologize for them. I also hope that my Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate will condemn these actions.\"",
      "Lee ignored questions from reporters about the posts at the Capitol Monday night, and deleted the posts on Tuesday.",
      "Scholten told ABC News she has faced threats before and emphasized the need for bipartisan condemnation of political violence.",
      "\"We need to come together, regardless of party, when this type of violence raises its head and condemn it in the strongest possible terms,\" she said, noting that Democratic lawmakers united in condemning violence when Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise was shot in 2017.",
      "Despite postponing a town hall meeting due to safety concerns, Scholten said she is determined to continue her work.",
      "\"I'm making it very clear we're not going to stop this work,\" she said, characterizing such threats as \"true domestic terrorism\" aimed at silencing lawmakers from serving their constituents.",

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",
      "\u201cI still like Barcelona,\" she said. \"I have met a lot of people who were kind.\u201d",

      "A growing number of Spaniards are souring on the country's highly successful tourism industry which is being blamed for a stubborn housing crisis",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- In Barcelona's residential Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood known for its quaint squares, Txema Escorsa feels he is being left behind.",
      "The friendly faces of neighbors in his apartment building have been replaced by a non-stop flow of hard-partying foreigners, and his teacher's salary can't keep pace with the rising rent.",
      "\"It is tough for me to imagine what to do next,\u201d he told The Associated Press in the living room of his two-bedroom apartment. \u201cIf I leave, will I be contributing to Barcelona losing its essence that comes from its locals? But there comes a time when I'm fed up.\u201d",
      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",
      "Similar demonstrations are slated in several other Spanish cities, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal's capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. (Both polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spaniards have staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Last year, Barcelona seemed to reach a tipping point when a rally in favor of \u201cdegrowing tourism\u201d ended with some protestors shooting water pistols at unsuspecting tourists. Images of those incidents went around the world, and more such scenes are expected on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt is very likely the water pistols will be back,\" said Daniel Pardo, one of the organizers of the Barcelona protest. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\u201d",
      "Spain, with a population of 48 million, hosted a record 94 million international visitors in 2024, compared with 83 million in 2019, making it one of the most-visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to studies cited by Spain's economy minister.",
      "Spain's municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Almost two-thirds of those who took part in a poll conducted last year in Barcelona said tourist apartments led to bothersome behavior. Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told AP that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being.",
      "Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate AP interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "\u201cThese record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges, and we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population,\u201d Cuerpo said.",
      "The short-term rental industry believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago told the AP. \u201cIf you look at the over-tourism problem in Spain, it has been brewing for decades, and probably since the 60s.\"",
      "He says hotels are still the leading accommodation for tourists. In Barcelona, hotels accounted for 20 million tourists in 2024, compared with 12 million who used homes, according to local data.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago notes the contradiction of Barcelona\u2019s Mayor Jaume Collboni backing the expansion of the city's international airport \u2014 announced this week \u2014 while still planning to wipe out the tourist apartments.",
      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Escorsa, the teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city; he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\u201cIn the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\u201d he said.",

      "Sacoolas and her husband, an American intelligence officer, were able to leave the U.K. under diplomatic immunity laws 19 days after the crash in August 2019. The U.S. government had invoked diplomatic immunity on her behalf, prompting an outcry in Britain.",
      "She admitted to police two months after the accident that she \u201cdrove like an American.\" She was given an eight-month suspended prison sentence in December 2022, though she declined to come to Britain for the court hearing.

      "But in a statement Wednesday, the companies said the federal government will have the right to appoint an independent director and \u201cconsent rights\u201d on specific matters.

      "Roughly 100,000 tons (90,000 metric tons) of spent fuel, some of it dating from the 1980s, is piling up at current and former nuclear plant sites nationwide and growing by more than 2,000 tons (1,800 metric tons) a year. The waste was meant to be kept there temporarily before being deposited deep underground.",
      "The NRC has said that the temporary storage sites are needed because existing nuclear plants are running out of room. The presence of the spent fuel also complicates plans to decommission some plants, the Justice Department said in court papers.",
      "Plans for a permanent underground storage facility at Yucca Mountain, northwest of Las Vegas, are stalled because of staunch opposition from most Nevada residents and officials.",
      "The NRC\u2019s appeal was filed by the Biden administration and maintained by the Trump administration. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, are leading bipartisan opposition to the facilities in their states.",
      "The NRC granted the Texas license to Interim Storage Partners, based in Andrews, Texas, for a facility that could take up to 5,500 tons (5,000 metric tons) of spent nuclear fuel rods from power plants and 231 million tons (210 million metric tons) of other radioactive waste. The facility would be built next to an existing dump site in Andrews County for low-level waste such as protective clothing and other material that has been exposed to radioactivity. The Andrews County site is about 350 miles (560 kilometers) west of Dallas, near the Texas-New Mexico state line.",
      "The New Mexico facility would be in Lea County, in the southeastern part of the state near Carlsbad. The NRC gave a license for the site to Holtec International, based in Jupiter, Florida.",

      "Pro Cheer League is billed as the first professional cheerleading league for athletes 18 and older designed to give cheerleaders the chance to keep competing after college.",
      "Bill Seely, president of Varsity Spirit based in Memphis, Tennessee, sees plenty of opportunity for all these sports to succeed. This cheer league's advantage comes from the sport's growth since the 1970s along with Varsity's own fan base through its cheerleading, dance team camps, events and shows.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to help us really kind of build this out in a way that is sustainable and will continue to grow not just domestically but globally,\" Seely said.",

    "story": [
      "The man charged with killing a prominent Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another could face the death penalty, something that is a rarity for Minnesota but could become more common under the Trump administration",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The man charged with killing a prominent Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another could face something that is a rarity for Minnesota but could become more common under the Trump administration: the death penalty.",
      "Minnesota abolished capital punishment in 1911, and the state's last execution was a botched hanging in 1906. But federal prosecutors announced charges against Vance Boelter on Monday that can carry the death penalty.",
      "It\u2019s not unheard of for state and federal prosecutors to both pursue criminal cases for the same offense, especially in high-profile matters.",
      "In this case federal authorities essentially grabbed the lead from the state prosecutor, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty. Boelter had been scheduled to make his first court appearance on state charges Monday, but instead marshals took him from the county jail to the U.S. courthouse in St. Paul, where he appeared on the more serious federal charges.",
      "Boelter is accused of fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Before that, authorities say, he also shot and wounded another Democrat, Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, who lived a few miles away. He surrendered Sunday night after what authorities have called the largest search in Minnesota history.",
      "Two of the six federal counts can carry the death penalty, something federal prosecutors have not sought in a Minnesota-based case since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.",
      "\u201cWill we seek the death penalty? It\u2019s too early to tell. That is one of the options,\u201d Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said Monday at a news conference where he revealed new details of what he described as a meticulously planned attack. They included allegations that Boelter also stopped at the homes of two other lawmakers that night and had dozens of other Democrats as potential targets, including officials in other states.",
      "Boelter\u2019s federal defenders have declined to comment on the case, and he has not entered a plea.",
      "On her first day in office in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi lifted a moratorium on federal executions that was imposed under the Biden administration in 2021. Only three defendants remain on federal death row after Biden converted 37 of their sentences to life in prison.",
      "Bondi has since authorized federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in at least three cases, including against Luigi Mangione for the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. In the other two cases, the Justice Department has said it is seeking the death penalty against defendants charged with killing fellow prison inmates.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration carried out 13 federal executions, more than the administration of any other president in modern history.",
      "The federal intervention in Boelter's case appeared to irritate Moriarty, the county's former chief public defender, who was elected on a police reform and racial justice platform in 2022 after the police killing of George Floyd.",
      "At a news conference Monday to announce the state charges, Moriarty gave only vague answers in response to questions about the interplay between the federal and state investigations. But she acknowledged \u201cthere's a tension\u201d and said federal officials \u201ccan speak for themselves.\u201d",
      "Moriarty said she intends to press forward in state court regardless and to seek an indictment for first-degree murder for the killings of the Hortmans, which would carry a mandatory sentence of life without parole. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for further comment Tuesday.",
      "As evidence of the tensions, the county attorney refused to clarify how Boelter' first hearings would play out. Court records show that Boelter was called for a first appearance in Hennepin County on Monday and that because he was not there as he was in federal custody, the judge issued a bench warrant as a formality, as requested by prosecutors.",
      "\u201cUsually murder cases are overwhelmingly handled in state courts,\u201d said Mark Osler, a death penalty expert at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. \u201cClearly this is something of national interest. And that seemed to play a role in the decision that the Justice Department is making here.\u201d",
      "Osler, who formerly served as Moriarty\u2019s deputy county attorney and head of her criminal division, as well as assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit, acknowledged that there are often tensions between state and federal prosecutors.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s complicated,\u201d Osler said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to avoid the sense of the older sibling grabbing something away from the younger sibling.\u201d",
      "If federal officials do pursue the death penalty, Osler said, they will face an unusual challenge: \u201ca jury pool drawn from the citizens of a state that has rejected the death penalty for over 100 years. It\u2019s not the same as choosing people in a state where there\u2019s a history of support for the death penalty, such as Texas.\u201d",
      "After his federal court appearance, Boelter was taken to the Sherburne County Jail in suburban Elk River, where federal prisoners are often held.",
      "Thompson told reporters that the federal case \u201cdoes not nullify the state charges. They remain in place. ... My expectation based on prior cases is the federal case, the federal charges, will be litigated first, but the state charges won\u2019t necessarily go anywhere.\u201d",
      "Boelter's next federal court appearance is June 27. He does not have any further appearances scheduled in state court.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a natural competitiveness that occurs sometimes between jurisdictions, but you have to hope that in the end, they\u2019re all facing the same way where there\u2019s something as important to public safety as this case is,\u201d Osler said.",

      "BOISE, Idaho -- With jury selection less than six weeks away, the trial in the stabbing deaths of four university students in Idaho could be delayed again as defense attorneys argue they need more time to prepare and that intense publicity has threatened Bryan Kohberger's right to a fair trial.",
      "Judge Steven Hippler will hear arguments Wednesday on the request. He is also expected to consider, in a closed session, whether the defense can present evidence of possible alternate suspects.",
      "Kohberger, 30, a former graduate student in criminal justice at nearby Washington State University, is charged with sneaking into into a rental home near the University of Idaho campus and fatally stabbing Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves on Nov. 13, 2022.",
      "Kohberger stood silent at his arraignment, prompting a judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.",
      "Defense attorney Anne Taylor wrote in a motion last month that proceeding with an August trial date would violate Kohberger\u2019s constitutional rights. She said the defense needs more time to review discovery, complete investigations and prepare mitigating evidence that could be presented if the case reaches the penalty phase.",
      "Taylor emphasized that in a death penalty case, the jury must consider any factor from a defendant\u2019s life history that might weigh against executing them. \u201cThis process is a comprehensive, time-consuming, and expensive undertaking,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut it is also what our Constitution demands when the government seeks to extinguish human life.\u201d",
      "Latah County prosecutors, led by Bill Thompson, argued against the defense team\u2019s \u201celeventh-hour motion.\u201d In a court filling this month, Thompson noted Kohberger has three defense attorneys, a public defender and a team of experts, investigators and a mitigation specialist.",
      "He said the request for more time has \u201cno end in sight\u201d and that beginning the trial as scheduled wouldn't violate his right to a mitigation case that passes constitutional muster.",
      "The killings in Moscow, Idaho, drew worldwide attention almost immediately, prompting a judge to issue a sweeping gag order that bars attorneys, investigators and others from speaking publicly about the investigation or trial. The trial was moved to Boise to gather a larger jury pool and the judge has sealed many case documents.",
      "It's all being done to limit potential juror's pretrial bias. Still, public interest remains high.",
      "A recent Dateline episode included details that weren't publicly released, and Hippler said the information appears to have come from law enforcement or someone close to the case.",
      "That's another reason to delay the trial, Kohberger's attorneys have argued.",
      "\u201cThe leaked materials appear carefully curated to promote a narrative of guilt,\u201d Taylor wrote. That raises serious concerns about the objectivity of investigators, especially if the source of the leak could be called as a witness.",
      "The defense has asked the judge to appoint a special investigator to identify the leaker, and prosecutors said they will cooperate. But Thompson argued that pretrial publicity alone is not reason enough to delay the case.",
      "\u201cThe question of whether Defendant can receive a fair trial is not answered by the amount of and the nature of pretrial publicity,\u201d he said. \u201cRather, it depends on whether a fair and impartial jury can be seated.\u201d",
      "He said anyone influenced by the coverage, including the Dateline episode, will be screened out during jury selection.",
      "The attention isn't likely to end soon. A book about the killings by James Patterson is set to be released in July. And a \u201cdocu-series\u201d centered on the morning the deaths were discovered is expected to air on Amazon Prime next month, and includes interviews with some of the victims' family members and friends.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is returning to Capitol Hill for the last in a series of hearings before lawmakers",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is returning to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for the last in a series of often combative hearings before lawmakers, who have pressed him on everything from a ban on transgender troops to his use of a Signal chat to share sensitive military plans.",
      "The questions \u2014 which also have touched on his firings of top military leaders and even some of his inner circle of advisers \u2014 may be dominated by the escalation of airstrikes between Iran and Israel that threaten a potentially devastating regional war. But he is still expected to face sharp questions about his chaotic tenure, his opposition to women in combat jobs and efforts to shift funding from troop housing to border security.",
      "The U.S. has shifted significant numbers of refueling tanker and fighter aircraft to position them to be able to respond if needed to the conflict, such as possible evacuations or airstrikes. Hegseth said this week that was done to protect U.S. personnel and airbases.",
      "\u201cWe are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that\u2019s what happens here,\" he told Fox News Channel. \u201cAnd America first means we\u2019re going to defend American personnel and American interests.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's testimony last week in three congressional hearings also was taken over by events, with the Trump administration dispatching the National Guard and 700 active-duty Marines to the protests in Los Angeles against California Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes. It came just ahead of a massive military parade to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday, which coincided with President Donald Trump's birthday.",
      "In the previous hearings \u2014 where Hegseth was appearing to discuss the Pentagon's spending plan \u2014 lawmakers made it clear they are unhappy that Hegseth has not provided full details on the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget.",
      "Trump has said it would total $1 trillion, a significant increase over the current spending level of more than $800 billion.",
      "Hegseth, who is appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, has spent vast amounts of time during his first months in office promoting the social changes he\u2019s making at the Pentagon. He\u2019s been far less visible in the administration\u2019s more critical international security crises and negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and Iran.",
      "For example, Hegseth directed the renaming of a Navy ship that had honored Harvey Milk, a slain gay rights activist who served as a sailor during the Korean War. He also has touted other moves to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and said a ban on transgender troops in the military was a way to regain the \u201cwarrior ethos.\u201d",
      "It will be Hegseth's first time before some senators since he squeaked through his Senate confirmation with a tie-breaking vote. It was the closest vote of any Trump Cabinet member.",
      "While he has talked a lot about making the military more lethal, it was his use of the unclassified, unsecured Signal messaging app that quickly caught public attention.",
      "Set up by then-national security adviser Mike Waltz, a group chat that included Hegseth and other senior administration leaders was used to share information about upcoming military strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "The chat came to light because the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to it. Waltz took responsibility for the gaffe, but Hegseth was roundly criticized for sharing details about the military strikes in that chat and in another one that included his wife and brother.",
      "The Pentagon's watchdog is looking into Hegseth's use of Signal and expected to issue a report soon.",

      "The jury is set to return for its third full day of testimony in the second murder trial of Karen Read, who is charged with killing her Boston police officer boyfriend",
      "DEDHAM, Mass. -- The jury is set to return for its third full day of testimony Wednesday in the second murder trial of Karen Read, who is charged with killing her Boston police officer boyfriend.",
      "Jurors began deliberations late last week, more than a month after the trial started. Tuesday's deliberations included several questions to the judge that concerned charges and evidence.",
      "Read, 45, is accused of striking John O\u2019Keefe with her car outside a suburban Boston house party and leaving him to die in the snow in January 2022. She has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene.",
      "Read's lawyers say O\u2019Keefe, 46, was beaten, bitten by a dog and then left outside a home in Canton in a conspiracy orchestrated by police that included planting evidence against Read.",
      "Read's second trial followed similar contours to the first, which ended in a mistrial last year.",
      "The jury asked questions of Judge Beverly Cannone, who also oversaw the first Read trial, on Tuesday. Both sides discussed the questions in open court.",
      "The first question related to the time frame of charge of operating a motor vehicle under the influence. Prosecutors wanted Cannone to instruct the jury to consider a time of 12:45 a.m., while the defense didn\u2019t want a time specified. The defense argued during the trial that Read returned home and kept drinking, which would have influenced her blood alcohol level. Cannone said she would advise the jury that they are the finders of fact and to make their own decision based on the evidence.",
      "On the second question, the jury asked whether video clips of interviews Read did in a documentary that were presented at the trial constituted evidence. The judge advised that they were.",
      "The third question pertained to the jury slip, specifically whether a guilty verdict on a lesser charge of driving under the influence meant guilt on the main charge, which is manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence. The defense argued that amendments should be made in the jury slip.",
      "Cannone returned to the courtroom with the jury present and answered the three questions, emphasizing this was their case to decide.",
      "\u201cYou folks have all the evidence. It\u2019s only you who decides the facts in this case. You are the fact finders,\u201d she said.",
      "After a break the jury returned a fourth question to Cannone, asking if they found Read not guilty on two charges but couldn\u2019t agree on the third charge, would it be a hung jury on all three charges? Cannone said she would respond to the jury that the question was theoretical and not one she could answer.",
      "The defense has said several jurors from the first trial came forward and said the jury was set to acquit Read of two charges but deadlocked on a third, leading to the mistrial.",
      "Defense attorney Alan Jackson began his closing argument Friday by repeating three times: \u201cThere was no collision.\u201d He told the jury that Read is an innocent woman victimized by a police cover-up in which officers sought to protect their own and obscure the real killer.",
      "Prosecutor Hank Brennan opened his own closing by saying Read callously decided to leave O\u2019Keefe dying in the snow, fully aware that he was gravely injured. He argued that she made the \u201cchoice to let\u201d hiom die, going further than prosecutors in the first trial in spelling out a motive.",
      "Jackson repeatedly attacked the lead investigator in the case, former Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, who was fired after sharing offensive and sexist texts about Read with friends, family and co-workers. He said Proctor's \u201cblatant bias\u201d tainted every aspect of a corrupt and flawed investigation and noted how prosecutors refused to put him on the stand, as they did during the first trial.",
      "Brennan said Read's blood alcohol level was two to three times the legal limit after the couple downed multiple drinks at two Canton bars. The couple, whose \u201ctoxic\u201d relationship was \u201ccrumbling,\u201d had an argument on the way to the house party that increased tensions and ultimately led to O'Keefe's death, the prosecutor said.",
      "Read faces several charges, the most serious being second-degree murder. If convicted she would face a maximum sentence of life in prison. She also faces a charge of manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence, which carries a maximum of 20 years.",
      "She is also charged with involuntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum of 20 years; motor vehicle homicide, which carries a maximum of 15 years; as well as operating under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death. They carry maximum sentences of 2 1/2 and 15 years, respectively.",

      "Seven people have been charged with stealing $100 million worth of diamonds, emeralds and more from an armored truck in July 2022 at a freeway rest stop north of Los Angeles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Seven people have been identified and charged with stalking an armored truck to a rural freeway rest stop north of Los Angeles and stealing $100 million worth of diamonds, emeralds and more in what is believed to be the largest jewelry heist in U.S. history, federal authorities announced Tuesday.",
      "Two of the seven suspects have been arrested and were due in federal court in Los Angeles on Tuesday, court records showed. Four of them remained at-large Tuesday, while one of the suspects is serving prison time in Arizona for an unrelated burglary and was expected to appear in court in Los Angeles in the coming weeks.",
      "Pablo Raul Lugo Larroig and Jeson Nelon Presilla Flores were arrested Monday, and both have been indicted on federal theft and conspiracy charges, authorities said. The Associated Press sent emailed requests Tuesday seeking comment from their lawyers.",
      "The heist unfolded in July 2022 after the suspects scouted the armored truck leaving an international jewelry show near San Francisco with 73 bags of jewelry, according to the indictment.",
      "The suspects followed the truck for roughly 300 miles (482 kilometers) to the rest stop north of Los Angeles, making off with 24 of the bags that authorities said also contained gold, rubies and luxury watches.",
      "Some of the jewelry has since been recovered, the U.S. Attorney's Office in California said Tuesday in a news release.",
      "Some of the suspects are also charged with other robberies, including one in March 2022 when $240,000 worth of electronics was taken from a truck.",
      "The indictment says some of the defendants would act as lookouts, while the others would break into trucks and steal the merchandise, sometimes by force or by threatening violence against the drivers.",

    "story": [
      "Texas has stopped providing new funding toward building a U.S.-Mexico border wall after lawmakers quietly approved a new budget that does not include funding for the project",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas has stopped putting new money toward building a U.S.-Mexico border wall, shifting course after installing only a fraction of the hundreds of miles of potential barrier that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott set out to construct four years ago.",
      "State lawmakers this month approved a new Texas budget that does not include continued funding for the wall, which had been a multibillion-dollar priority for Abbott as part of a sprawling immigration crackdown. He even took the unusual step of soliciting private donations for construction, saying in 2021 that many Americans wanted to help.",
      "On Tuesday, Abbott's office said President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to curb immigration allowed the state to adjust.",
      "The halt in funding was first reported by The Texas Tribune.",
      "\u201cThanks to President Trump\u2019s bold leadership, the federal government is finally fulfilling its obligation to secure the southern border and deport criminal illegal immigrants,\" Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said. \u201cBecause of these renewed federal assets in Texas, our state can now adjust aspects of state-funded border security efforts.\u201d",
      "The state has completed 65 miles (104 kilometers) of border wall since construction began. The Texas border with Mexico is roughly 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers).",
      "The wall has gone up at a slow pace as the state has navigated the drawn-out process of buying private land and confronting local opposition in some places. Abbott announced plans for the wall at a time when large numbers of migrants were showing up at the border, saying in 2021 that he believed a combination of state-owned land and volunteered private property would \"yield hundreds of miles to build a border wall.'",
      "The number of migrant crossings has fallen dramatically this year.",
      "\u201cThere was no need for it in the first place,\u201d said Scott Nicol, a board member for Friends of the Wildlife Corridor, a habitat preservation group in the Rio Grande Valley. He has criticized the wall as ineffective.",
      "\"The only thing that\u2019s changed is the political dynamic,\u201d he said.",
      "The new budget approved by Texas lawmakers allocates about $3.4 billion for border security for two years. That amount will not be used to build out new projects for the wall and instead go to the Texas Department of Safety and the Texas National Guard, the main agencies responsible for Operation Lone Star, Abbott's key immigration program launched in 2021 during the Biden administration.",
      "The money allocated for border security is nearly half the $6.5 billion that was dedicated to immigration efforts the last time lawmakers earmarked the state budget two years ago.",
      "Funds previously allocated for the wall will allow work on it to continue through 2026 and \u201cwill set the federal government up for success,\u201d said Republican Sen. Joan Huffman, the lead budget writer in the state Senate.",
      "The agency responsible for constructing the wall has about $2.5 billion remaining in funding to cover up to 85 additional miles (85 additional kilometers) of the wall by 2026, according to a statement made in April by Texas Facilities Commission executive director Mike Novak, whose agency is overseeing construction of the project.",
      "\u201cThis wall should have never been built, it\u2019s useless,\u201d said Bekah Hinojosa, co-founder of the South Texas Environmental Justice Network. \"It divides our community.\u201d",

      "A lifelong friend of the alleged Minnesota gunman says Vance Boelter had been struggling to find work and was wrestling with a \u201cdarkness that was inside of him\u201d at the time of the shootings",
      "Hours after the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers over the weekend, authorities asked David Carlson to identify his lifelong friend in a harrowing photograph.",
      "Carlson says he had known and trusted Vance Boelter from the time the two played together as children. But he barely recognized the 57-year-old in the surveillance image police showed him of Boelter wearing a flesh-colored mask as he carried out what authorities described as a political rampage.",
      "\u201cThe guy with the mask, I don\u2019t know that guy,\u201d Carlson said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press, recounting his decades-long friendship with a man he likened to a brother. Boelter's involvement in such an attack, he said, was as surprising to him as \u201cgetting struck by lightning.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was a darkness that was inside of him,\" Carlson said. \"He must have kept it hidden.\"",
      "As authorities piece together Boelter's movements and motivations, Carlson and others are conducting their own inventory of their interactions with the one-time pastor, wondering whether they missed any red flags.",
      "Boelter is a married father of five but often stayed at Carlson's home in Minneapolis to shorten his commute to work. In hindsight, Carlson said, Boelter \u201cwas a sick man\u201d and needed help, even if those around him didn't realize it in time.",
      "Law enforcement has cautioned the motive could be more complex than pundits might prefer, even as Boelter's own disjointed writings suggest he was hell-bent on targeting Democrats.",
      "Boelter has been charged with federal murder and stalking, along with state counts, in the fatal shootings of former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. He is also accused of wounding Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette.",
      "At the time of the shootings, Carlson said Boelter had been struggling to find work and was \u201cdisappointed\u201d he wasn\u2019t hearing back from people.",
      "In February, Boelter abruptly quit his job delivering bodies from assisted living facilities to a funeral home and returned for several weeks to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where he had founded several companies focused on farming and fishing.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a mistake for him to quit his job,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was going to get anywhere with the Congo.\u201d",
      "But the life change was in keeping with Boelter\u2019s impetuous \u201cmentality to always go to the extreme,\u201d Carlson said, recalling a time in the 1990s when Boelter was captured by security forces after sneaking into Gaza to preach Christianity on a trip to Israel. \u201cThat\u2019s how crazy Vance is,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d",
      "Years earlier, after becoming a Christian, Boelter \u201cburned all of his belongings,\u201d Carlson said, including karate and martial arts weapons and anything else that distracted from his religion.",
      "Boelter graduated in 1990 from an interdenominational Bible college in Dallas, earning a diploma in practical theology in leadership. The Christ For The Nations Institute said in a statement it was \u201caghast and horrified\" to learn the suspect was among its alumni, saying \u201cthis is not who we are.\u201d",
      "The church Boelter attended outside Minneapolis has not responded to emails from AP but issued a similar statement condemning the shootings as \u201cthe opposite of what Jesus taught his followers to do.\u201d",
      "Boelter, who worked as a security contractor, offered a glimpse of his opposition to abortion in a 2023 sermon he gave in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, saying \"they don\u2019t know abortion is wrong in many churches.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a radical cultist,\" Carlson said. \u201cHe was just a regular Christian and kind of outspoken.\u201d",
      "Boelter was unrestrained when it came to his distaste for Democrats, Carlson said, but that rhetoric never seemed threatening. Carlson and another friend, Paul Schroeder, told AP they never heard Boelter talk about abortion or any of the officials who were targeted.",
      "The FBI said Boelter \u201cmade lists containing the names and home addresses of many Minnesota public officials, mostly or all Democrats.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, \u2018We gotta stop them, man,\u2019\u201d Carlson said. \u201cBut it chills me to think he was in his room writing that stuff in my house.\u201d",
      "Boelter would go to a shooting range occasionally but was not fanatical about firearms, another friend, Paul Shroeder said.",
      "\u201cI thought he was just collecting them for self-defense,\" Carlson said. \"It was 1,000 miles away from stalking people and killing them.\u201d",
      "Carlson said he awoke Saturday to an alarming text message from Boelter, who warned he was \u201cgoing to be gone for a while,\u201d and \u201cmay be dead shortly.\u201d Carlson initially thought his friend was suicidal and went to check his room.",
      "He said he was so concerned he called police, who \u201cat first didn\u2019t seem too interested\" before quickly connecting the messages to the shootings.",
      "\u201cWhy throw your whole life away? God, he\u2019s so stupid,\" Carlson said. \"He had everything.\u201d",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- A senior Cuban diplomat has accused the Trump administration of trying to discredit the thousands of Cuban doctors working around the world and deprive the country of an important source of income.",
      "Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, who was at U.N. headquarters this week for a debate on sanctions, told The Associated Press that the U.S. is putting pressure on other countries and financial institutions to break their ties with Cuba.",
      "Cossio said over the decades Cuba has sent more than 100,000 doctors to more than 70 countries to provide much needed medical care. More than 22,000 doctors are now working in more than 50 countries, according to the government.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has described the program as \u201cforced labor.\u201d He announced visa restrictions in late February on Cuban and foreign government officials involved in Cuba\u2019s medical missions. In June, the Trump administration imposed visa restrictions on several unidentified officials from Central America for their involvement with the Cuban program.",
      "And in a letter obtained by AP last week, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asked the 34 members of the Organization of American States for details of any agreements with Cuba for medical missions. It specifically requested information on whether the medical workers have labor and union rights, and about any labor complaints.",
      "The commission, an independent body of the OAS, which is heavily funded by the United States, said it would analyze the data and make recommendations, \u201cgiven the persistence of reports of rights violations.\u201d",
      "The State Department said Tuesday it was pleased its action \u201chas prompted meaningful discussion of this exploitative labor export program after years of denial.\u201d It said the U.S. will not stop raising these issues until Cuba curtails the \u201cforced labor\u201d of its own citizens.",
      "Cossio defended the program in an interview on Monday. He said all Cuban doctors working abroad receive their regular salary, plus \u201ca dignified stipend.\u201d",
      "Starting about 15 years ago, he said, Cuba began receiving compensation from wealthier countries for providing the doctors. That money covers the stipends, with the rest going to finance Cuba\u2019s public health system, he said.",
      "Cossio accused the United States of trying to discredit the medical missions, first by saying that Cuba was not sending doctors but agents to \u201csubvert\u201d these counties. He said the U.S. then accused Cuba of human trafficking and put pressure on the countries that have agreements with Cuba to refuse any future medical missions.",

      "Cossio also criticized the Trump administration for reversing a U.S. policy of welcoming Cubans into the country.",
      "The administration has started cracking down on Cubans who have entered the U.S. since October 2022 on two-year permits to live and work, a Biden administration program known as humanitarian parole. President Donald Trump this month also announced additional restrictions on visitors from Cuba, among other countries.",
      "The restrictions have come as a shock to the 2.4 million Cuban-Americans. They strongly backed the Republican president in both elections and have long enjoyed a place of privilege in the U.S. immigration system.",

      "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from limiting passport sex markers for many transgender and nonbinary Americans",
      "BOSTON -- A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from limiting passport sex markers for many transgender and nonbinary Americans.",
      "Tuesday's ruling from U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick means that transgender or nonbinary people who are without a passport or need to apply for a new one can request a male, female or \u201cX\u201d identification marker rather than being limited to the marker that matches the gender assigned at birth.",
      "In an executive order signed in January, the president used a narrow definition of the sexes instead of a broader conception of gender. The order said a person is male or female and rejected the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender.",
      "Kobick first issued a preliminary injunction against the policy last month, but that ruling applied only to six people who joined with the American Civil Liberties Union in a lawsuit over the passport policy.",
      "In Tuesday's ruling she agreed to expand the injunction to include transgender or nonbinary people who are currently without a valid passport, those whose passport is expiring within a year, and those who need to apply for a passport because theirs was lost or stolen or because they need to change their name or sex designation.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The government failed to show that blocking its policy would cause it any constitutional injury, Kobick wrote, or harm the executive branch\u2019s relations with other countries.",
      "The transgender and nonbinary people covered by the preliminary injunction, meanwhile, have shown that the passport policy violates their constitutional rights to equal protection, Kobick said.",
      "\u201cEven assuming a preliminary injunction inflicts some constitutional harm on the Executive Branch, such harm is the consequence of the State Department\u2019s adoption of a Passport Policy that likely violates the constitutional rights of thousands of Americans,\u201d Kobick wrote.",
      "Kobick, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, sided with the ACLU's motion for a preliminary injunction, which stays the action while the lawsuit plays out.",
      "\u201cThe Executive Order and the Passport Policy on their face classify passport applicants on the basis of sex and thus must be reviewed under intermediate judicial scrutiny,\u201d Kobick wrote in the preliminary injunction issued earlier this year. \u201cThat standard requires the government to demonstrate that its actions are substantially related to an important governmental interest. The government has failed to meet this standard.\u201d",
      "In its lawsuit, the ACLU described how one woman had her passport returned with a male designation while others are too scared to submit their passports because they fear their applications might be suspended and their passports held by the State Department.",
      "Another mailed in their passport Jan. 9 and requested to change their name and their sex designation from male to female. That person was still waiting for their passport, the ACLU said in the lawsuit, and feared missing a family wedding and a botany conference this year.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, the Trump administration argued that the passport policy change \u201cdoes not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.\u201d It also contended that the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed since they are still free to travel abroad.",

      "Mother Emanuel AME church made an ecumenical gesture for the commemoration of a racist shooting that killed nine of its Black members 10 years ago on Tuesday",
      "CHARLESTON, S.C. -- People of faith gathered again at Mother Emanuel AME on Tuesday just like they did 10 years ago, searching for God\u2019s truth and His love in the church fellowship hall.",
      "On that horrible night in 2015, nine Black church members were gunned down by a white man who hated them just for the color of their skin. He sat with them through their Bible study, then as they closed their eyes and bowed their heads, he started firing.",
      "As survivors gathered in 2025, they invited another congregation that knows the pain of murderous hatred to join them. When a gunman killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in 2018, Mother Emanuel's pastor, the Rev. Eric Manning, flew to Pittsburgh to comfort another flock.",
      "It was up to Rabbi Jeff Myers to lament Tuesday that the world hasn't changed as much as was hoped by the congregation of the South\u2019s oldest African American church, which was founded by enslaved people, torn down after they rebelled and then rebuilt following the Civil War.",
      "\u201cBoth of us were assaulted by Americans who did not want us to exist, who thought violence would solve their problems,\u201d Myers said.",
      "Then he read the portion of the U.S. Declaration of Independence that starts with \u201cwe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\u201d",
      "\u201cExcept for the Jews and the Blacks. That\u2019s how I feel in America right now,\u201d Myers said.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly said American society combines hate and guns in a stew that threatens the country's existence.",
      "\u201cWe know that hate is dangerous. But hate with a gun in its hand is deadly,\u201d said Kelly, who was joined at the Mother Emanuel pulpit by his wife, former U.S. House member Gabby Giffords, who was gravely wounded in a January 2011 mass shooting in Arizona.",
      "The Charleston church massacre did change the world in some ways.",
      "The shooter, now on death row just like the killer at Tree of Life, posted selfie photos with a Confederate flag to hammer home his racist reasons for shooting Black parishioners. For many, this act made it impossible to keep defending the rebel banner as a symbol of southern heritage. South Carolina then took the flag down from the Statehouse grounds where it was installed as a rebuttal to federal desegregation orders.",
      "But some things are the same. Mother Emanuel's sanctuary still has the same deep red carpet. The church continues its mission of empathy, empowerment, encouragement and equipping.",
      "And the nation still struggles with the legacy of enslaving Black people for hundreds of years.",
      "South Carolina remains one of only two states in the U.S. without a hate crime law even though survivors keep pushing for it. Months before the massacre at Mother Emanuel, a white North Charleston police officer shot and killed an unarmed Black man in the back about 10 miles (16 kilometers) away. Six years later, a white officer knelt on a Black man's neck in Minnesota for nine minutes, killing him.",
      "\u201cOn paper, the concept of the United States is a wonderful one. In reality, it is not successful right now,\u201d Rabbi Myers said.",
      "Mother Emanuel member Marvin Stewart has tried to emulate the love he saw in his nine friends killed that night.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the present time is very demoralizing and very challenging with the political divide. As I sat in church today, and I keep hearing the word forgiveness, I said, \u2018am I in that space?\u2019 I would use the word acceptance as the space I\u2019m in,\u201d Stewart said after the service.",
      "One hymn was sung Tuesday. It was \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d \u2014 the spiritual that Barack Obama, the nation's first Black president, began singing at the memorial service for the nine victims, held just blocks from Gadsden's Wharf, where an estimated 40% of enslaved Africans first touched U.S. soil.",
      "Rapturous applause rained down when survivors of the shooting and relatives of the people killed were asked to stand and be seen.",
      "Chris Singleton, whose mother Sharonda Coleman-Singleton was killed, asked everyone to \u201chug somebody who looks different than you,\u201d and for several minutes the packed sanctuary was abuzz with smiling people, arms reaching over pews and hugs spilling into aisles.",
      "Large photos of those killed were on display in the sanctuary \u2014 pillars of the community who included the church's pastor who was a state senator, a high school track coach, the church sexton, a librarian and an aspiring poet. The shooter sprayed more than 70 bullets to kill them \u2014 and told Polly Sheppard he was leaving her alive so that the world would know his motive: \"You\u2019re taking over our country. And you have to go.\u201d",
      "He failed, the Rev. Manning said: People of faith are still here, working together for good through God.",
      "\u201cLet the memory of the Emanuel Nine be a light that guides us not only to remembrance, but also to renewal and change,\u201d he said.",

      "If ICE agents take custody of Guevara, Diaz said, his case would move to federal immigration court for potential deportation proceedings.",
      "Diaz insisted that Guevara has a strong case for being allowed to stay in the U.S. But he said that President Donald Trump's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement has added \u201canother level of anxiety.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the DeKalb County Sheriff's Office, Cynthia Williams, confirmed that Guevara was being held for immigration authorities. An ICE spokesperson in Atlanta did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",

They immigrated to Georgia, where Guevara worked as a reporter for Georgia's largest Spanish-language newspaper, Mundo Hispanico, before launching his own online news site, MGNews.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s been doing this type of work for 20-plus years, and now he gets detained,\" Diaz said. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning. He\u2019s a member of the press. And he doesn\u2019t seem to be committing any crime.\u201d",

      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is lifting a curfew in downtown Los Angeles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Downtown Los Angeles businesses hoped customers would return quickly on Tuesday after Mayor Karen Bass lifted a curfew she had imposed last week to prevent vandalism and break-ins during nighttime protests against President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "The protests, which have been concentrated in a few blocks of downtown where federal and local government buildings are, were in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown in the city and subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines.",
      "The curfew set in place June 10 provided \u201csuccessful crime prevention and suppression efforts\" and protected stores, restaurants, businesses and residents, the Democratic mayor said. It covered a relatively tiny slice of the sprawling city.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, the impact of days of protests could be seen in the boarded-up windows lining the streets of Little Tokyo, a historical Japanese American district right next to a federal detention building still heavily guarded by military troops.",
      "A steady stream of tourists stopped in the neighborhood to take photos of baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani wearing Dodgers blue in a massive mural on the side of a hotel.",
      "Don Tahara, the owner of Far Bar, said businesses in the area have been hit hard with vandalism and some break-ins.",
      "On June 8, thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to Trump\u2019s deployment of the Guard, blocking off a major freeway as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd. Photos captured several Waymo robotaxis set on fire.",
      "A day later, police officers used flash bangs and shot projectiles as they pushed protesters through Little Tokyo, where bystanders and restaurant workers rushed to get out of their way. Some protesters set off fireworks and threw water bottles at the officers, yelling, \u201cShame!\u201d",
      "But Tahara, a third-generation Japanese American immigrant, said he also understands why the protests were necessary, seeing similarities between the current administration's immigration raids and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.",
      "\u201cThe problems that Little Tokyo had 75 years ago was basically the federal government coming in and imprisoning all of them in concentration camps,\u201d Tahara said. \u201cThey were uprooted from their homes and businesses, their churches ... we're seeing a repeat of that.\u201d",
      "Since people assumed the curfew would still be in place Tuesday, Far Bar has still had many cancellations of reservations and events. They decided to open earlier for lunchtime in the past few days, but employees have lost hours from their paychecks. Combined with the lingering effects of the LA wildfires earlier this year, tariff-induced price increases and other increased costs, it has been a challenging climate for businesses to navigate, Tahara said.",
      "On Monday, Bass trimmed back curfew hours from beginning at 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. after a drop in arrests in the area. Bass faulted a relatively small group of \u201cbad actors who do not care about the immigrant community,\u201d a nod to thousands of protesters who exercised their rights peacefully. Trump directed federal immigration officials Sunday to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, a move that comes after a weekend of large protests all across the country against his administration.",
      "Cindy Reyes, head server at Rakkan Ramen, said they completely shut down the shop for Saturday's protests and closed early on Sunday. The curfew was especially difficult for their night-shift workers because the ramen joint is usually open until midnight.",
      "\u201cDinner shift makes the most money because we're the last restaurant standing so people come to us in the end,\u201d she said.",
      "The Historic Core of downtown LA, further away from where the protests have occurred and home to many nightclubs and bars, has also suffered from break-ins. Many closed down for the duration of the curfew because their core business happens in the evening.",
      "Rhythm Room owner Vincent Vong said he has lost tens of thousands of dollars from closing for a whole week, not just from the loss of business but also to keep paying his employees.",
      "\u201cI have to schedule people to come in because I need to get them paid somehow,\u201d he said.",
      "He wished there was more support from the city and deployment of law enforcement resources to protecting the \u201cmost vulnerable areas,\u201d pointing out that his street has often been the target of vandalism and theft during large demonstrations.",
      "Even as the curfew is lifted, Vong said it will be difficult to bring customers back to an area that still has boarded-up windows and feels \u201capocalyptic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to double down in showing that downtown LA is still a safe place to go,\u201d he said.",

      "A proposal by Senate Republicans would adjust the pace at which some crucial home energy efficiency and electric vehicle tax credits are phased out in timelines different from what House Republicans proposed in the multitrillion-dollar tax bill they pa...",
      "Tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, albeit less quickly, under Senate Republicans' latest proposed changes to a massive tax bill. Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.",
      "Senate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.",
      "Ultimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.",
      "\u201cThey want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.\u201d",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electric companies, issued a statement applauding the Senate proposal for including \u201cmore reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese modifications are a step in the right direction,\u201d said the statement from Pat Vincent-Collawn, the institute\u2019s interim chief executive officer, adding that the changes balance \u201cbusiness certainty with fiscal responsibility.\u201d",
      "Whether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.",
      "Notably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.",
      "The clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "The House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.",
      "Language included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.",
      "The Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.",
      "On the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.",
      "At the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.",
      "\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.",
      "\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House\u2019s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cCanceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,\u201d Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.",
      "The Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.",

      "Monday\u2019s request from the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office was the first time authorities had asked for a new execution date since Roberson received a stay in October. The execution's delay followed a flurry of last-ditch legal challenges on the night of his scheduled lethal injection that were prompted by an unprecedented maneuver from a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers who say he is innocent and was sent to death row based on flawed science.",
      "In its five-page motion, the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office said because the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state\u2019s top criminal court, has previously denied appeals in Roberson\u2019s case, \u201cthe criteria for setting an execution have been met.\u201d",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office requested a new execution date of Oct. 16.",

      "Court documents show the Anderson County District Attorney\u2019s Office, which had prosecuted Roberson, has agreed to let the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office take over the case.",
      "Roberson, 58, was convicted of the 2002 killing of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the East Texas city of Palestine. Prosecutors argued he violently shook his daughter back and forth, causing severe head trauma in what\u2019s called shaken baby syndrome. His lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia.",
      "Gretchen Sween, one of Roberson\u2019s attorneys, criticized the office of Attorney General Ken Paxton for asking for a new execution date when Roberson still has an appeal pending before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that his legal team says contains \u201cpowerful new evidence of his innocence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no justification for the Attorney General\u2019s relentless effort to kill an innocent human being \u2014 and no state law or moral law that authorizes seeking an execution date under these circumstances,\u201d Sween said in a statement.",
      "In its latest appeal filed in February, Roberson\u2019s legal team said new evidence, including statements from pathologists that state the girl\u2019s death was not a homicide and question the reliability of conclusions by the medical examiner on the cause of death, show \u201cno rational juror would find Roberson guilty of capital murder; and unreliable and outdated scientific and medical evidence was material to his conviction.\u201d",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have asked that a hearing be held over whether a new execution date should be set. It was not immediately known when a court hearing could be held as the case currently does not have a presiding judge as the previous judge recused herself from the case in November.",
      "Roberson had been in a holding cell in October, a few feet away from America\u2019s busiest death chamber in Huntsville, waiting to receive a lethal injection when he was granted an execution stay after a group of Texas lawmakers issued a subpoena for him to testify before a House committee several days after he was scheduled to die.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court ruled in November that although the subpoena was valid, it could not be used to circumvent a scheduled execution.",
      "Roberson never testified before the House committee as Paxton\u2019s office blocked efforts to have him speak to lawmakers.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/desi-arnaz-singer-husband-dad-and-the-man-who-invented-tv/",
    "published": "Wed, 18 Jun 2025 09:29:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

      "When asked for a comment Tuesday about the allegations, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons told CBS News, \"For privacy, safety and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any incarcerated individual, including medical and health-related issues.\" The bureau also said it does not comment on pending litigation or legal proceedings.",
      "Duke University Hospital, where Kelly was taken, deferred comment to the Bureau of Prisons.",

      "Kelly was moved to solitary confinement earlier in June, according to the motion filed Monday. He had his medication for anxiety and to help him sleep with him and had shown that to prison staff, Brindley said.",
      "But, on Thursday evening, prison personnel \"provided him with additional medication and instructions to take it,\" Brindley alleges. Kelly took the medication and the next morning he felt faint and dizzy.",
      "\"He started to see black spots in his vision. Mr. Kelly tried to get up, but fell to the ground. He crawled to the door of the cell and lost consciousness,\" according to Brindley's motion.",
      "Kelly was taken to a hospital where he was told he was given an overdose quantity of his medications, Brindley said.",
      "Additionally, at the hospital, Kelly showed doctors his swollen leg, which Brindley said he had been seeking medical attention for because he has a history of blood clots. Prison medical staff had allegedly taken him off blood thinners.",
      "A scan at the hospital \"revealed blood clots in his right leg, blood clots in his left leg, and blood clots in his lungs,\" Brindley said.",
      "Kelly was told he would need to stay at the hospital for seven days and was scheduled for a surgery for the clots, according to the motion. However, officers then came into his hospital room and removed Mr. Kelly.",
      "\"He was taken from the hospital against his will and against the directives of the doctors,\" Brindley said. \"Mr. Kelly's life is in jeopardy right now because the Bureau of Prisons denied him necessary surgery to clear clots from his lungs. He could die from this condition, and they are letting it happen.\"",
      "This is not the first time Kelly's attorney has sought to move him from federal custody\u00a0over alleged threats to his life. Earlier in June, Brindley claimed prison officials recruited a white supremacist to kill Kelly.",

    "story": [
      "A doctor charged with giving Matthew Perry ketamine in the month leading up to the \"Friends\" star's overdose death will plead guilty, according to an agreement filed in court Monday.",
      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in a statement that the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. They said Plasencia is expected to formally plead guilty in the coming weeks.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money.",
      "The physician had been one of the primary targets of the prosecution, along with a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer. Three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation.",
      "Plasencia and the woman, Jasveen Sangha, had been scheduled to face trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Perry, 54, was found unresponsive and floating face-down in his jacuzzi on\u00a0Oct. 28, 2023, according to\u00a0an autopsy report\u00a0from the Los Angeles County medical examiner. His cause of death was \"the acute effects of ketamine,\" with contributing factors including drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of buprenorphine, a medication used to treat opioid addiction.",
      "Ketamine is a Schedule III hallucinogen. It is a controlled substance with legitimate uses, but it is also used illegally, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Martin Estrada told reporters during a news conference last year, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "\"It can cause serious health effects, serious health problems including loss of consciousness, including spikes in blood pressure and respiratory issues that can deprive the brain of oxygen,\" Estrada said. \"For that reason, it is a drug that must be administered by medical professionals and the patient must be monitored closely.\"",
      "\"That did not occur here,\" he said.",
      "Perry had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. He began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.",
      "Plasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.",
      "He admitted to enlisting the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.",
      "\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between the Los Angeles area where Plasencia practiced and San Diego, where Chavez practiced, and exchanged several vials of ketamine, the filings said.",
      "After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Plasencia admitted to visiting Perry's house twice and injecting him with ketamine. He also left ketamine behind and showed Perry's personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, how to inject it, according to Iwamasa's plea agreement. The doctor later met up with Iwamasa and gave him more ketamine for Perry, according to the document.",
      "Perry was also getting ketamine from another source, Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major dealer and supplied the dose that killed the actor.",
      "Sangha has pleaded not guilty \u2014 making her the only one of the five people charged in Perry's death who has not entered a plea agreement. She remains jailed as she awaits trial. Plasencia was freed on bond after his initial court appearances.",
      "Erik Fleming, a friend of Perry who said he acted as a middleman and drug messenger, has also pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with prosecutors.",
      "None of the defendants have yet been sentenced. Plasencia's plea deal makes no specific sentencing guarantees.",
      "Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on \"Friends,\" when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC's megahit.",

    "summary": "Since his death in 1981 at age 38, the singer-songwriter's legacy has only grown beyond such emotional songs as \"Cat's in the Cradle\" and \"Taxi,\" to include charities he founded to address food insecurity, while living life with a simple credo: \"When in doubt, do something.\"",
    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know, I'm gonna be like him\"",
      "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon. \"When you coming home, Dad?\" \"I don't know when, We'll get together then.You know we'll have a good time then\"",
      "To hear Harry Chapin perform \"Cat's in the Cradle,\" click on the video embed below:",
      "So, how did Chapin's own children feel about that song?",
      "Jen Chapin said, \"The one time when I get a little eeehhh is when somebody tells me, like, 'Oh, your dad, he played a three-and-a-half-hour concert, and then he signed every single poetry book, and he kissed my girlfriend, and \u2026' And I'm like, 'That's great, but that was time we didn't have.'\"",
      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",
      "Harry Chapin came from a musical family. He and two of his brothers formed a band. \"We became the Chapin Brothers,\" said Harry's younger brother, Tom Chapin. \"And we played together for ten years. And it was the only time we were ever cool!\"",
      "Tom has his own successful performing career, but Harry was always the driven one. \"When I was a kid, I came up with this line that the family loved: 'Two's company, Harry's a crowd!'\" he laughed. Harry, he said, was outgoing, \"and unafraid. He had this energy that was astonishing.\"",
      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

      "Mason asked, \"How did you feel when you saw the film?\"",
      "\"I was very happy to see the good parts,\" Wilson said. \"But the dark periods were, like, very rough to watch.\"",
      "John Cusack plays an older Brian Wilson, the artist struggling to recover from depression, mental illness and drug abuse. Paul Dano pays the younger Brian Wilson, the musical genius who dreams up the Beach Boys' intricate harmonies and orchestrations.",
      "Wilson was just 20 when the Beach Boys signed with Capitol Records and made their first album in an L.A. studio.",
      "Mason asked, \"Do you remember recording in this room?\"",
      "\"I remember recording 'If everybody had an ocean across the USA ...'\" Wilson said.",
      "He would create the most successful band in America, blending the voices of his brothers Dennis and Carl, cousin Mike Love, and close friend Al Jardine. \"Mike on bass, Al and Dennis and Carl in the mid-range, and me on falsetto. We all sang together. And the harmony just happened.\"",
      "\"Love & Mercy\" focuses on two pivotal points in Wilson's life: First, the recording of The Beach Boys' highly-influential \"Pet Sounds\" album in 1965, that featured \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows.\"",
      "\"I was so proud of that album, I could have cried,\" said Wilson. \"Very proud of it.\"",
      "\"Your father fought you about it, and the band fought you about it,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Well, they didn't like it. Mike and the guys didn't like it. They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "The film's other focus is the 1980s, and Wilson's troubled relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, the psychologist accused of making him a virtual prisoner.",
      "It took nearly two decades for the film to be made. And when Brian's wife, Melinda, first saw it, she said, \"I got up and I bolted. I drove around the city for two hours, And it was tough. It was tough to watch.\"",
      "\"What were you doing while you were driving around the city?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Just thinking. 'Oh my God, did we do the right thing? It's been 19 years and this is how it's ending.'\"",
      "\"And how did you make peace with it?\"",
      "\"It was the truth,\" she said. \"So that's how I made peace with it. When you tell the truth, everything works out.\"",
      "The film tells the story of how Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) first met the troubled musician in 1986.",
      "\"I went to a Cadillac dealership to buy a car,\" recalled Wilson. \"And she was working there, and when I saw her I liked her the first time I saw her. And she sold me a car!\"",
      "Wilson gave Melinda a card that read, \"Frightened, scared, lonely.\"",
      "\"Did you look at that card right away?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Oh yeah, I was just like, What is he trying to tell me?  I knew I liked him. I knew I liked him a lot. And then when he left the card I was just like, what's going on here?\"",
      "Brian was then under the 24-hour care of Dr. Landy (Paul Giamatti in the film), who was controlling every aspect of his life, even co-writing songs, co-producing his records, and screening who could see him.",
      "Mason asked Wilson, \"When you think of that period of your life, what do you think of?\"",
      "\"Unhappiness,\" he said. \"Being tortured.  All that stuff.\"",
      "\"Is it something you try not to think of?\"",
      "\"Yeah.  Yeah.\"",
      "About six months into their relationship, Melinda decided she had to act: \"I called the Attorney General and he said there was nothing that could be done unless his family got involved. So a lot of times with Landy I had to be play-acting because I knew he was a bad guy.\"",
      "\"That's got to be an extremely difficult position to be in,\" said Mason.",
      "\"It was like I said to my mother:  'You know, I feel like a child is being abused.' And I couldn't find anybody that wanted to help. As much as I hate to say it, I think the family just -- they were at their rope's end with Brian and they didn't really know what to do.\"",

      "Melinda recalled Brian telling her, \"I want outta this hellhole.\" And that, she told Mason, gave her all the impetus she needed.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Jun 2025 08:04:16 -0400",
    "summary": "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two measles vaccine doses, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "At least 3% of measles cases confirmed so far this year have been in people who received two doses of the measles vaccine, meaning they were fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two vaccine doses, the agency said Friday in its weekly update on cases. An additional 2% of cases were in people who received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.",
      "Many of the cases were in Texas, which on Tuesday\u00a0counted\u00a0a 21st confirmed measles case in someone with at least two doses of the vaccine.",
      "Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Monday that their first 20 cases were in children 8 years old or younger. Anton did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the additional case, which was reported on Tuesday.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said in an email their data reflects vaccination status at the time someone was exposed to the virus. This means none of the 36 vaccinated cases they confirmed Friday received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",
      "The CDC says people exposed to measles can get vaccinated within 72 hours of when they were first exposed, if they are not fully immunized. \"If administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, MMR vaccine might provide some protection against infection or modify the clinical course of disease,\" the agency's recommendations say.",
      "The CDC spokesperson said, \"The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.\"",
      "\"Disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people,\" the spokesperson said. \"People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.\"",
      "\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" the spokesperson said. \"People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.\"",
      "Texas has seen a deadly outbreak of the highly contagious virus this year. While cases there have recently slowed, CDC officials have said that authorities have been tracking more outbreaks in other communities across the U.S. linked to travel outside and inside the country.",
      "\"Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up,\" Brian Wakeman, deputy lead of the CDC's measles laboratory task force, said Monday.",
      "Wakeman, who spoke on a nationwide call for testing laboratories, said the U.S. is now on pace to top the 1,274 cases of measles seen in 2019. That was the most cases the U.S. has seen in a single year since endemic spread of the virus was declared \"eliminated\" at the end of the 20th century.",
      "\"We're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90s,\" Wakeman said.",
      "None of the confirmed measles cases that led to hospitalizations this year had documented evidence of receiving two doses of vaccine, the CDC spokesperson said. More than 8 in 10 of the cases have been in people 20 years old or older.",
      "Six cases of measles in people who received at least two doses of the vaccine were in Colorado, that state's health department says.",
      "\"None of the six cases with 2+ doses were seniors or required hospitalization,\" Hope Shuler, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email.",
      "Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" said Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Colorado says many of its vaccinated cases have been in residents who were exposed during travel to other parts of the world facing large outbreaks like Canada and Europe.",
      "The state previously said it had linked multiple cases to an infectious traveler who exposed others at Denver International Airport and on a Turkish Airlines flight.",
      "The CDC has\u00a0issued new guidance\u00a0for summer camps to prepare for the threat of measles spread this year, including urging camp operators to check for documentation of immunity among staff and children.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:40:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who led the agency's network to study hospitalization trends from infectious diseases like COVID-19 has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",

      "\"Measles can spread quickly in summer camps because campers and staff spend a lot of time together in close contact with each other. Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",

      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired the previous roster of the CDC's vaccine advisers on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The CDC also removed the career officials tasked with overseeing the committee and its agenda, effectively replacing them with an appointee of the Trump administration.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety. Some have ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. One says he previously invested in a vaccine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy \"has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints\" on the panel and said that ethics agreements would be made public for the new members before they begin work for the ACIP.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "He also previously testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit by a law firm tied to Kennedy against Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil. Kulldorff was being paid $400 an hour, he said in 2024. Reuters previously reported Kulldorff's work for the firm, WisnerBaum.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation process, Senate Democrats had accused him of a conflict of interest for his ties to WisnerBaum and its litigation against Merck's vaccine, calling on him to amend his ethics agreement to avoid cashing in on any settlements or judgments from the lawsuit.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who previously worked as the chair of the FDA vaccine panel that Meissner served on, described Meissner as the only person she knew from Kennedy's list with credible experience in pediatric infectious diseases and analyzing the illnesses and deaths prevented by vaccines.",
      "Meissner was previously listed in April as a consultant to the RSV vaccines work group for the CDC committee, before Kennedy fired its advisers.",
      "\"He's a card-carrying infectious disease person who knows the burden of these diseases, and he knows the risk and the benefit. And I think it will be a challenge for him, but obviously, he knows what he's getting into,\" Edwards said.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Pediatrician Dr. Vincent Iannelli questioned Pebsworth's objectivity in a post Wednesday on his Vaxopedia website, citing a 2009 blog post where she described her advocacy on the issue.",
      "\"For those of us within the vaccine-injured communities who are fighting on behalf of our children for the basic human right to make voluntary, informed vaccination decisions that are based on sound science rather than ideology, it is a battle. And it is personal,\" Pebsworth wrote.",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "In an interview Levi shared on social media after the announcement, he said he would \"keep an open mind,\" but also stood by his previous call for mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 shots to be suspended.",
      "\"I think it's obvious that these mRNA vaccines should not be given to anybody young or healthy. It is also not at all clear to me that they should be given to anybody, based on the evidence,\" he said.",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "In 2021, Levi spoke at a meeting of the FDA's outside vaccine advisers during its public comment session, opposing a broad authorization of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "An article co-authored by Levi in 2022\u00a0raised \"concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side-effects\" based on data from Israeli emergency calls.",
      "He\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0this year for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university.",
      "\"Dr. Michael Ross has not held a faculty appointment at the George Washington University since 2017,\" Katelyn Deckelbaum, a spokesperson for the university, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Deckelbaum said that Ross was previously a clinical professor, but stopped teaching medical students or residents at the university.",
      "A spokesperson for Virginia Commonwealth University, Leila Ugincius, said Ross \"was an affiliate faculty member\" through the university's regional campus at Inova, a hospital system in the D.C. area, before a partnership with the hospital ended in 2021.",
      "Ross\u00a0is listed as cosigning an open letter during the COVID-19 pandemic that criticized a study that concluded ivermectin was ineffective for treating the disease. The University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy\u00a0previously reported Ross had backed the letter.",
      "\"We oppose this fixation on randomized controlled trials at the expense of other clinical and scientific evidence and urge medical policymakers to restore balance to the practice of medicine,\" the letter said.",
      "The investment firm Havencrest Capital Management lists Ross as a partner. The firm said Ross is a pediatrics professor, not an obstetrics and gynecology professor.",
      "Maryland-based Manta Pharma\u00a0had until Thursday listed\u00a0Ross as a medical adviser. On a LinkedIn\u00a0profile\u00a0that had been linked by the company, Ross said he worked for and served on advisory boards for several medical companies, including \"an investment in a vaccine company.\"",
      "HHS, Havencrest Capital Management and Manta Pharma did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Dr. James Pagano",
      "Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a \"strong advocate for evidence-based medicine,\" has published two fiction titles about hospital medicine.",
      "\"Over the course of his medical career he has worked in a number of emergency departments in the greater L.A. area, including major trauma centers as well as smaller community hospitals. He has been the medical director of one ER or another for many years,\" describes an Amazon listing for one of his books in 2012.",
      "A blog and X account with Pagano's name from several years ago wrote about a range of issues, like\u00a0voicing disappointment over Republicans failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but says little about vaccines.",
      "Records from the Medical Board of California list Pagano as being retired.",
      "Dr. Joseph Hibbeln",
      "Another Kennedy pick, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2020. His research portfolio previously covered nutritional intake of fatty acids like omega-3. He previously participated in federal panels related to his work, including the federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.",
      "Kennedy described him as bringing \"expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies.\"",
      "Hibbeln previously co-authored a study probing whether exposure during pregnancy to mercury was linked to autism, in the wake of now-debunked research that falsely suggested a mercury-based preservative that was previously used in vaccines was causing autism.",
      "They concluded that there was \"no consistent evidence from this study to implicate prenatal exposure to mercury\" in causing autism, and that \"the benefits of nutrients in fish counteract any possible adverse cognitive and behavioral differences\" caused by mercury exposure.",
      "A 2023 presentation by Hibbeln about seafood intake in pregnancy listed him as a professor at the University of Bristol and a psychiatrist for California-based Mindful Health Solutions.",
      "Kennedy's monthslong search for new members",
      "Kennedy's picks cap a monthslong search that the secretary and his aides have conducted for replacements to the committee.",
      "Former CDC official Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said he was among those approached for suggestions early this year. He said none of his suggestions were among Kennedy's picks.",
      "Klausner criticized Kennedy's pick of Malone, calling him a \"a well-known promoter of various conspiracy theories and was advocating for use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID.\"",
      "\"Seems like his appointment is not consistent with some of Secretary Kennedy's public commitments,\" Klausner said.",
      "Kennedy told reporters on Monday that he was picking \"highly credentialed\" experts for the panel.",
      "\"We're going to bring people onto the ACIP panel, not anti-vaxxers, who are bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence-based medicine,\" he said.",
      "In an \"FAQ\" document shared with stakeholder groups, HHS said the department intended \"to ensure balanced membership in terms of the points of view represented.\"",

    "summary": "Social Security is dipping into its trust fund to pay current retirees, with spending outpacing its revenue from payroll taxes.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security is on track to deplete its trust fund by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, when the federal retirement program will be required to cut monthly benefits by about 20%.",
      "The new projection, issued Wednesday in the Social Security Board of Trustees'\u00a0annual report,\u00a0is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees, the report said. Last year's report had forecast\u00a0that the program would need to cut benefits starting in 2035, impacting Social Security's 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "The Social Security program has been staring down a financial crunch for years, although the trust fund's depletion date can change from year to year due to fluctuations in the economy and the number of beneficiaries. The trust fund is slated to be depleted partly due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population, which means its reserves are drawing down because spending is outpacing income.",
      "\"Congress, along with the Social Security Administration and others committed to eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, must work together to protect and strengthen the trust funds for the millions of Americans who rely on it \u2014 now and in the future \u2014 for a secure retirement or in the event of a disability,\" said Frank Bisignano, commissioner of Social Security, in a statement.",
      "Even if the trust funds are depleted \u2014 which may not occur if Congress makes changes to how the program is funded, for instance \u2014 benefits won't suddenly disappear.",
      "Instead, Social Security beneficiaries would see a 19% cut to their benefits, the report said.",
      "Changes to Social Security",
      "One of the changes to Social Security this year that will have a \"substantial\" impact on the program is the Social Security Fairness Act, which went into effect on January 5, the report said.",
      "Americans are also filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, the program's data shows. The number of people claiming benefits jumped 17% to 1.8 million\u00a0in 2025 through May versus the same period a year earlier, putting the program on track to enroll 4 million new beneficiaries in 2025.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the\u00a0Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0at the agency and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, which had already been struggling to provide services to retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",

      "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel announced Wednesday that they have finalized their long-awaited partnership.",
      "Under the announced agreement, U.S. Steel will retain its name and headquarters in Pittsburgh. The steel will continue to be \"mined, melted and made\" in the United States, the companies said. The partnership is expected to create more than 100,000 jobs throughout the U.S., and will feature \"unprecedented massive investments in steelmaking in the United States,\" the companies said in their announcement.",
      "A deal between Nippon and U.S. Steel was first proposed in late 2023. Then-President Joe Biden\u00a0rejected the deal\u00a0on national security grounds near the end of his time in office, but President Trump\u00a0ordered a new review\u00a0of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities\u00a0rather than fully acquiring\u00a0the company.",
      "On June 13, Mr. Trump cleared the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel. The companies say they have \"now completed the transaction as contemplated by their merger agreement.\"",
      "The companies have also entered into a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government.",
      "Under that agreement, Nippon Steel has agreed to make about $11 billion in new investments in U.S. Steel by 2028, including an initial investment in a greenfield project that will be completed after 2028, they said. The agreement also requires that the majority of members of U.S. Steel's board of directors and key management personnel, including its CEO, be U.S. citizens, and says that U.S. Steel will remain a U.S.-incorporated entity.",
      "Takashi Mori, Nippon Steel's representative director and vice chairman, will serve as chairman of the board of U.S. Steel, according to the news release.",
      "The United Steelworkers union issued a statement accusing the companies of \"down-playing concerns\" about what the deal would mean over the long-term.",
      "\"As the sale concludes, it seems likely that attention will dissipate,\" USW president\u00a0David McCall\u00a0said. \"However, our union will remain. We will continue watching, holding Nippon to its commitments. And we will use the most powerful tool workers have against global corporations: collective bargaining.\" The union's current contract agreement expires in September 2026.",
      "The deal announced Wednesday requires that U.S. Steel maintain capacity to produce and supply steel from U.S. production locations to meet market demand in the country, and says that Nippon Steel will not \"prevent, prohibit, or otherwise interfere with U.S. Steel's ability to pursue trade action under U.S. law.\"",
      "The company will also issue a \"golden share\" to the U.S. government, which will give the president the power to approve or veto a number of major corporate decisions, and gives the U.S. government the right to appoint one independent director.",
      "The deal comes as Mr. Trump recently doubled tariffs on foreign steel imports.",
      "\"This is a momentous day for our country, our communities, and the American steel industry,\" said U.S. Steel CEO Dave Burritt in a news release announcing the partnership details. \"Thanks to President Trump's bold leadership, American workers secured the best possible deal. U. S. Steel will remain rooted in the United States and continue to call Pittsburgh home. Through our partnership with Nippon Steel, we are poised to grow better and bigger, with transformative investment, cutting-edge technology, and the creation of good-paying jobs across the United States.\"",

      "Keeping the rate unchanged would signal ongoing caution from the Fed as it continues to monitor how Mr. Trump's economic policies will play out.",
      "\"Recent Fed commentary has reinforced a wait-and-see approach, with officials signaling little urgency to adjust policy amid increased uncertainty around the economic outlook,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "While consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, the uncertainty brought on by the president's tariffs hasn't fully faded. The inflation rate also\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0in May to 2.4%, compared with 2.3% in April.",
      "Even though job growth is slowing, the labor market continues to hold up, with payroll gains\u00a0exceeding economists' expectations\u00a0last month.",
      "\"The current data do not support that theory that prices are rising or that the labor market is weakening quickly,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting.",
      "What date is the Fed's next meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 the 12-member group that sets rate decisions \u2014 will meet on June 17-18. The FOMC's decision will be announced on Wednesday, the second day of the meeting.",
      "What time is the Fed rate announcement?",
      "The Fed will share the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on June 18. Powell will then discuss the committee's decision at a press conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. that same day.",
      "The meeting will also include an economic forecast that touches on how interest rates are expected to change in coming years.",
      "One thing to watch will be whether the decision is unanimous, or if there is any dissent from voting members, said Mulberry. A divided decision would mark a shift from May's meeting, when\u00a0all 12 members\u00a0voted to hold the benchmark rate steady.",
      "\"Some members have been expressing concerns about slowing growth, although very slightly, and that should be debated heavily as a driver to cut rates sooner rather than continuing to pause,\" he said in an email.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Not likely. Echoing CME's data, economist polled by FactSet predict a 97.5% probability the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"There is a tendency to romanticize the idea of interest rates coming down, but with the economy chugging along and a lot of uncertainty about what happens with inflation, there is nothing compelling the Fed to cut interest rates right now,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email.",
      "The last time the Fed made a reduction was in December 2024, when it slashed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "While the Fed's decision to hold rates steady may be unwelcome news for the nation's borrowers, it would bode well for savers who benefit from higher interest rates. Schulz said now is to the time for people to shop for high-yield savings accounts or to lock in CD rates. \"Those returns aren't as high as they were a year ago, but they're still really strong,\" he said in an email.",
      "The moment could also be ripe for paying down high-cost credit card debt and padding your emergency savings, said McBride.",
      "If the Fed holds steady, Americans can expect credit card rates, auto loans and mortgages to remain high. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently hovering around 7% while credit card rates have skyrocketed to\u00a0over 20%.",
      "But that's not to say that a rate cute would necessarily bring down borrowing rates for homebuyers, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in a research note.",
      "\"Even a Fed rate cut isn't a guarantee that mortgage rates would fall, since the Fed doesn't impact mortgage rates as directly as it does credit cards,\" said Schulz. \"However, the Fed does impact rates indirectly, so a rate cut, whenever it eventually arrives, would likely be a hopeful signal for shoppers.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, reversing a major policy pivot just a few days after issuing it internally, two sources familiar with the latest guidance told CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were told they could continue carrying out worksite enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants at farms, hotels and restaurants, as long as they are targeted in nature.",
      "The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said ICE officials were informed of the new guidance during a call Monday.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection. But they remain far below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by the White House.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has ignored a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. A deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the president would sign the latest executive order this week delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days, marking the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "The current extension expires Thursday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support that gave ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court days before it took effect.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

    "summary": "The bill was stalled for weeks amid Democratic pushback and contentious amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate crypto after a bumpy path through the upper chamber.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would establish a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "It passed the Senate in a 68 to 30 vote.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who introduced the measure, said the legislation \"ushers in a new era of payments.\"",
      "\"The prospect of faster and cheaper payments will have far-reaching implications for our financial system,\" he said Tuesday. \"Once the GENIUS Act is law, businesses of all sizes and Americans across the country will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously, rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks. Put simply, stablecoins are a paradigm-shifting development that can bring our payment system into the 21st century.\"",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "In early May, Democrats prevented the legislation from advancing, leading to weeks of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes that convinced enough Democrats to come back on board and help propel it through several procedural votes.",
      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",
      "More than 100 amendments were offered from Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from barring the president, vice president and other top government officials from profiting from stablecoin ventures while in office to prohibiting large online platforms from issuing the digital assets.",
      "Two Republicans have also consistently voted against the legislation \u2014 Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 albeit for different reasons. Paul doesn't see a need for federal regulation of the industry, while Hawley has warned that it cedes too much power to tech giants.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, who worked on the bill, defended the framework as long overdue.",
      "\"To date, Congress' failure to act has left the digital asset space as a wild West, where American consumers are vulnerable to scams and businesses are desperate for the regulatory clarity they need to compete with foreign countries, foreign entities that do business in our markets, effectively. Doing nothing and protecting the status quo is not only irresponsible, it's unacceptable,\" she said on the Senate floor last week.",
      "Gillibrand acknowledged that Mr. Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere is \"extremely unhelpful\" but argued it \"does not diminish the excellent work in this legislation.\"",

      "Amazon's CEO envisions an \"agentic future\" in which AI robots, or agents, replace humans working in the company's offices.",
      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",

    "summary": "Utilities are racing to build data centers to meet surging demand for AI and other tech services. Ratepayers will pick up the tab, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

      "At Home's court filings reveal fissures in the company's finances. At Home shuttered six stores in the last year, according to the company's Chapter 11 filing. And some macroeconomic factors like inflation and tariffs have placed \"significant pressure\" on its revenue, the company said.",

      "Fifteen states initially agreed to the settlement in January. Since then, an additional 34 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., joined the settlement, according to details released Monday by attorneys general involved in the case. Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",
      "\"For decades, the Sacklers put profits over people, and played a leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addictions and overdoses,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"While no amount of money can fully heal the destruction they caused, these funds will save lives and help our communities fight back against the opioid crisis.\"",
      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",

      "The details of the golden share were disclosed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Saturday in a social media post, where he described the agreement as including \"powerful terms that directly benefit and protect America, Pennsylvania, the great steelworkers of U.S. Steel and U.S. manufacturers that will have massively expanded access to domestically produced steel.\"",
      "What is a golden share?",
      "A \"golden share\" refers to special rights held by a government over a corporate entity. They are typically granted in relation to newly privatized businesses over which the government wants to maintain some control,\u00a0according to legal research company Westlaw.",
      "Golden shares have been employed in countries ranging from the U.K. to China, although they are rare in the U.S. In the former case, the U.K. government held a golden share in the British Airports Authority, although it was ruled illegal by a court in 2003. In the latter, the Communist Party had taken a percentage ownership in private companies as well as control over government board seats and voting power, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported in 2023.",
      "While presidents can indirectly influence corporate decisions through agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, which reviews mergers for antitrust concerns, it's unusual for a commander-in-chief to exercise the level of control outlined by Lutnick regarding U.S. Steel. According to his post, U.S. Steel \u2014 which would keep its name and headquarters after the merger \u2014 also wouldn't be allowed to change its name from U.S. Steel without President Trump's approval.",
      "The president has the authority to name one of the corporate board's independent three directors and can veto the other two choices, the Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the terms of the agreement who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. The details of the board structure were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "\"The Art of the Deal,\" Lutnick wrote of the agreement, referencing Mr. Trump's best-selling book about his business skills and negotiating techniques.",
      "Terms remain unclear",
      "Lutnick described the golden share in the U.S. Steel deal as \"perpetual.\" The Commerce Department didn't return a request for clarification on if the golden share would transfer to subsequent presidents after Mr. Trump leaves office.",
      "The full terms also remain somewhat unclear. The companies have not made public the full terms of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel nor the national security agreement with the federal government.",
      "On Friday, the two companies\u00a0announced in a joint statement\u00a0that they had agreed to the terms of the government's national security agreement. They added the terms mandate $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and provides for \"a Golden Share to be issued to the U.S. Government.\"",
      "The U.S. Steelworkers union told CBS MoneyWatch that it can't comment on the golden shares without seeing more information about the agreement. But it pointed to a June 15 statement that expressed the union's disappointment with the president's decision to move forward with the merger.",
      "\"Details matter: Neither the government nor the companies have publicly identified what all the terms of the proposed transaction are,\" the union letter said. \"And, while there is a claimed 'golden share,' what can we expect from Nippon's leadership in Japan which continues to build up overcapacity in steel globally and has been charged again with dumping by the Department of Commerce just weeks ago?\"",

    "summary": "The Trump Organization said its $47.45 monthly service will includes unlimited calls, text and data. It's also rolling out a $499 mobile phone.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump Organization announced it is starting a cellular phone service called T1 Phone by Trump Mobile that will charge $47.45 a month and include unlimited calls, text and data. It also plans to roll out a new $499 phone that will be built in the U.S.",
      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",
      "\"We want to have customer service by Americans for Americans,\" Eric Trump said in the Monday interview. \"We want to have phones built by Americans, for Americans, and, you know, and we want to do it better than anybody. We're going to disrupt the space.\"",
      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",
      "If Apple were to build its iPhones in the U.S., they would cost about $3,500 each, more than triple their current retail price of about $1,000, because of the higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S., Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said.",
      "Ethics issues raised",
      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",
      "\"Will they be intimidated to advertise that?\" he pointed out.",
      "And if the phone is made with foreign-made parts, it raises issues about whether the company could get a break on the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"It threatens to be a real distortion of the economy around the Trump brand,\" he said. \"My message to hard-working Americans is to slam down the phone in the face of this marketing ploy.\"",
      "What does Trump Mobile phone plan include?",
      "The Trump Mobile plan will \"revolutionize cell phones, mobile calling,\" Eric Trump told Fox Business.",
      "\"It's going to be cheaper, 47 bucks a month. You're going to have more internet. More international dialing for free, hundreds of countries. International dialing for free. It is the biggest bang for the buck,\" he added.",
      "The plan will include free calls to more than 100 countries, including those with U.S. military bases. People with the plan will also have access to 24/7 roadside assistance through Drive America, as well as telehealth services, the company said.",
      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0with a price tag of $499, requiring a down payment of $100. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The Trump Organization website says the T1 Phone will be available in August, although the Trump Mobile website states the phone will debut in September.",
      "The device, which will have a fingerprint sensor and the ability to unlock using face recognition, will include 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12gb of RAM. It uses the Android operating system.",
      "It's unclear what company will manufacture the devices, with the Trump Mobile website noting that its products and services \"are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.\" The website adds that the T1 Phone LLC is using the \"Trump\" name as part of a limited license agreement.",
      "\"I think we're going to really shake up the space in a very big way, both in terms of the actual hardware of the films and then obviously e-sim cards, and then just what you get for a plan per month,\" Eric Trump added.",

But what exactly sets certain places apart?",
      "A new study from financial site WalletHub seeks to answer that question by analyzing data for 148 of the nation's largest cities.",
      "To determine its rankings, WalletHub looked at dozens of metrics that represent a city's \"quality of services\" across public finances, education, health, safety, infrastructure and more. After scoring cities across these metrics, WalletHub then compared the data against each city's per-capita budget to determine which are run the best.",
      "\"The best-run cities in America use their budgets most effectively to provide high-quality financial security, education, health, safety and transportation to their residents,\" said Chip Lupo, a WalletHub analyst, wrote in the study. \"Many of the top cities also have a very low amount of outstanding government debt per capita, which can prevent financial troubles in the future.\"",
      "Read on to find out where your city falls on WalletHub's list.",
      "What are the best-run cities?",
      "Provo, Utah, ranks as the best-run city in the U.S., according to the WalletHub study. Home to 115,000 people, the western city is probably best known for its towering mountains and as the birthplace of Brigham Young University.",
      "A constellation of factors pushed Provo to the top of the list, including its robust business growth (5.2%), impressive high school graduation rate (91%), infrastructure and safety ratings, with it the fourth-lowest violent crime rate in the country. The nation's average high school graduation rate stands at 87%.",
      "Trailing Provo at number two and number three are Nampa, Idaho, which stands out due to its low government debt and safety ratings, and Manchester, New Hampshire, respectively. The latter notched points for low pollution levels and steady growth in home values.",

      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity.

      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decadelong plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",

They were sold online at Anker's website \u2014 as well as Amazon, eBay and Newegg \u2014 between June 2016 and December 2022 for about $27 across the U.S., according to the recall notice.

    "summary": "An estimated 4 million Americans will lose health insurance over the next decade if Congress doesn't extend enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Miami\u00a0\u2014 Josefina Muralles works a part-time overnight shift as a receptionist at a Miami Beach condominium so that during the day she can care for her three kids, her aging mother, and her brother, who is paralyzed.",
      "She helps her mother feed, bathe, and give medicine to her adult brother, Rodrigo Muralles, who has epilepsy and became disabled after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled against Texas and landowners who challenged a plan to store thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste at a facility in the state.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a challenge brought by Texas and a group of landowners to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to temporarily store thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste at a facility in the state.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a decision for a 6-3 court in the case of NRC v. Texas\t that neither Texas nor a land developer were parties to the commission's licensing proceeding, and therefore are not entitled to obtain judicial review. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.",
      "The court reversed a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that allowed the case to move forward and ordered the lower court to deny or dismiss the petitions for review filed by Texas and the landowners. It did not address a second matter raised in the dispute regarding whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the authority to license private companies to store nuclear waste offsite.",
      "\"In short, the Hobbs Act affords judicial review to those who were parties before the commission. Here, obtaining party status required Texas or Fasken to successfully intervene in the commission proceeding,\" Kavanaugh wrote for the six-justice majority. \"Because neither Texas nor Fasken successfully intervened, they may not obtain judicial review of the commission's licensing decision under the Hobbs Act.\"",
      "The Hobbs Act is a 1950 law that dictates when a \"party aggrieved\" by an agency's final order can seek review from a federal appeals court.",
      "How to address the problem of nuclear waste has been complicated by politics since the advent of nuclear power last century. In 1982, Congress enacted a law requiring the federal government to establish a permanent facility to store spent nuclear fuel. Yucca Mountain in Nevada was later selected to house this repository.",
      "But the site hasn't yet been established amid pushback from the state, and the project was halted during the Obama administration. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will seek to restart the Yucca Mountain project.",
      "The issue of where to put the increasing amount of spent fuel remains. More than 90,000 metric tons of nuclear waste from commercial power plants are currently privately stored, both at or away from nuclear reactor sites, according to the Government Accountability Office. Plants continue to generate an additional 2,000 metric tons of spent fuel each year, as nearly 20% of the nation's electricity is supplied by nuclear energy, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "Spent fuel from a nuclear reactor can remain radioactive and pose health risks for thousands of years,\u00a0according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "In September 2021, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a license to a company called Interim Storage Partners that allowed it to store 5,000 metric tons, and up to 40,000 metric tons, of nuclear waste in dry-cask, above-ground storage for up to 40 years.",
      "The facility would be built in Andrews County, Texas, located west of Dallas and near the New Mexico border. The area is already home to a disposal site for low-level radioactive waste.",
      "Before the commission granted the license, the state submitted comments opposing the storage site and warned against housing spent nuclear fuel on a \"concrete pad\" above Texas' Permian Basin, where 250,000 active oil and gas wells capture 40% of the nation's oil reserves.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott and the Texas Commission on Environmental Equality did not try to intervene during the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's proceedings. But other groups did try to object, including a company that owns land in the Permian Basin, though its request was denied by the commission.",
      "The state and landowners asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to review the government's license to Interim Storage Partners, and the court allowed the legal battle to proceed. The 5th Circuit also ruled that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not have the authority to issue a license that let nuclear waste to be held at privately owned facilities offsite from where the spent fuel was generated.",
      "Whether the commission could allow private companies to temporarily store nuclear waste was only one part of the dispute before the Supreme Court. The first, key issue for the justices to weigh was whether Texas and landowners who challenged the license to Interim Storage Partners could do so in the first place, since they didn't intervene at an earlier stage in the licensing process.",
      "The high court determined that Texas and the landowners could not seek judicial review of the commission's decision to issue Interim Storage Partners its license. Still, Kavanaugh noted that \"history and precedent\" offer support for the commission's interpretation that the Atomic Energy Act allows spent nuclear fuel to be stored offsite at private facilities.",
      "\"To be clear, because Texas and Fasken's claims are not judicially reviewable, we need not and do not decide the ultimate question of statutory authority that the dissent focuses on,\" he wrote for the six-justice majority. \"So that there is no confusion, however, we underscore that in resting on the threshold reviewability issue, we are not somehow assuming or buying into a premise that the commission is wrong on the underlying merits.\"",
      "Writing in dissent, Gorsuch, joined by Thomas and Alito, said that the commission's decision to issue the license to Interim Storage Partners was unlawful. Accepting the commission's argument that Texas and Fasken could not seek review of its licensing decision \"requires us to ignore the full scope of the agency's own licensing proceeding,\" he wrote.",
      "Gorsuch continued: \"It forces us to reimagine a statute expanding public access to the agency's administrative proceedings into one restricting access. And it asks us to believe that the very state in which the agency intends to store spent nuclear fuel indefinitely cannot be heard in court to complain about the agency's plans. Because nothing in the law requires us to indulge any of those fantasies, I respectfully dissent. \"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled that Tennessee's law restricting gender-affirming care for transgender youth does not violate the 14th Amendment.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Tennessee law that restricts access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, a decision that is likely to have broad implications for access to medical treatments for transgender youth in half of the country.",
      "In the case of U.S. v. Skrmetti, high court ruled 6-3 to reject the challenge brought by the Biden administration, three families and a physician who had argued that Tennessee's law violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. The court concluded that the state's measure, which is known as SB1 and was enacted in 2023, does not run afoul of the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"Our role is not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.",
      "The court's majority found that Tennessee's law is not subject to a heightened level of judicial review and satisfies the most deferential standard, known as rational basis.",
      "\"We are asked to decide whether SB 1 is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause,\" Roberts wrote. \"We hold it is not. SB1 does not classify on the bases that warrant heightened review.\"",
      "The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, were in dissent. Sotomayor read her dissent from the bench.",
      "The court, Sotomayor wrote, \"obfuscates a sex classification that is plain on the face of this statute, all to avoid the mere possibility that a different court could strike down SB1, or categorical healthcare bans like it.\"",
      "Joined in her dissent by Kagan and Jackson, she continued: \"The court's willingness to do so here does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight. It also authorizes, without second thought, untold harm to transgender children and the parents and families who love them.\"",
      "The Tennessee law",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18. The state is one of 25 with laws that seek to restrict access to gender-affirming care for young people diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, marked the first in which the Supreme Court stepped into the politically charged debate over health care for transgender youth. In addition to the state prohibitions, President Trump has issued executive orders that address what he calls \"gender ideology.\" One declares that it is the federal government's policy to recognize \"two sexes, male and the female,\" and the second threatens federal funding for medical institutions that offer gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 18.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposals are being challenged in the federal courts.",
      "Known as SB1, Tennessee's law prevents health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state had argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "Shortly before the law took effect, three families with transgender children and a physician who provides the treatments to patients with gender dysphoria challenged the ban in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The Biden administration then intervened in the case.",
      "A federal district court blocked the law, finding that it discriminates based on sex and transgender status. A divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit then reversed that decision and allowed Tennessee's ban to take effect while legal proceedings continued.",
      "The appeals court evaluated the law under rational-basis review, the most deferential of the tiers of judicial scrutiny. But the Biden administration and the families had argued Tennessee's ban should be subject to a more stringent level of review, known as heightened scrutiny, because it draws lines based on sex and discriminates based on transgender status.",
      "But Tennessee had argued that the state aims to protect young people from the consequences of the medical treatments, which it said are risky and unproven. The state said it was setting age- and use-based limits on medical care and exercising its authority to regulate medicine.",
      "Access to gender-affirming care has become a flashpoint in the culture wars, as half of the states have in recent years enacted laws that limit the availability of the medical interventions. Many of those same states have also enacted measures prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.",
      "The court's decision",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority found that Tennessee's law classifies on the basis of age and medical use, since treatments like puberty blockers and hormones can be administered to treat certain conditions, but not gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder or gender incongruence.",
      "Classifications that turn on age or medical use are subject to only rational-basis review, the least demanding level of judicial review, it said.",
      "\"Under SB 1, no minor may be administered puberty blockers or hormones to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence; minors of any sex may be administered puberty blockers or hormones for other purposes,\" Roberts wrote.",
      "The majority said that Tennessee had \"plausible reasons\" for restricting access to gender-affirming care that brought its inquiry over the law's constitutionality to an end, namely concerns about the health risks. The justices said they wouldn't second-guess the legislature over the lines that the ban draws.",
      "\"Recent developments only underscore the need for legislative flexibility in this area,\" Roberts wrote, pointing to a report from England's National Health Service that evaluated the evidence regarding the use of puberty blockers and hormones and characterized it as \"remarkably weak.\"",
      "\"This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,\" he wrote. \"The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.\"",
      "Roberts concluded that the court's role is only to ensure that the law does not violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.",

      "\"There are thousands of volunteers of all political persuasions who serve on hundreds of these boards. That particular board has over 60 people on it. The Governor does not interview applicants for these roles and he does not know Boelter. They are not appointments to a position in the Governor's cabinet. These boards and commissions have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies.\"",

      "David Schultz, political science professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, says under state law, the governor appoints hundreds of people to dozens of boards across the state, ranging in topics as disparate as amateur sports, mosquito control and tourism.",
      "Schultz says appointees are unpaid and the state's boards are more technical than political, with bipartisan appointments and, essentially, citizen volunteers. The governor's role, according to Schultz, is more ceremonial.",
      "\"They're not vetted or reviewed personally by the governor. In many cases, this is done as it should be, by subordinates, you know, who then bring to the governor the recommendations,\" Schultz said. \"And this is no different than what we would find in business and industry, where we don't expect the president of most companies to be involved in the hiring for every position.\"",
      "Schultz says people are oftentimes allowed to serve a couple of terms. Additionally, each board has different meeting requirements. Some meet just once a year, while others meet more frequently. And because these were statewide appointments, meetings often happened over Zoom, especially after the COVID pandemic.",

So far as I know, he has no lawyer. He has been stripped of his due process rights by a government and a judge that owe him a credible fear hearing before they deport him, and yet have decided instead to strip folks like Edgardo.

The violence that you witness from a sitting citywide official who's simply standing to bear witness [to] what is happening to other humans, that violence you saw him experience, just imagine what they do to people who are less well known,\" said New York City Councilmember Alex Avil\u00e9s.",
      "\"What I saw today was not the rule of law,\" Lander's wife says",
      "Lander's wife, Meg Barnette, held an earlier news conference outside the courthouse, saying she was with him when he was arrested.",
      "\"I joined him today, because this is the third time that he has done court watching here, and I have been moved and horrified and found his stories very compelling, and I wanted to be here with him to witness for myself,\" Barnette said. \"What I saw was shocking and unacceptable and not in accordance \u2014 I am an attorney. I haven't practiced law in a while, but I sure know that what I saw today was not the rule of law. That was not due process, and the way people are being treated is absolutely unacceptable in this city and this country.\"",
      "She told reporters Lander and other advocates had repeatedly asked to see the judicial warrant and grounds for deportation and they were linking arms with the person at the center of the hearing, whom he later identified as Edgardo.",
      "\"We're surrounding the individual, locking arms. We asked \u2014 I was part of the group \u2014 and we asked numerous times for the warrant, for their names, for their badge numbers. It was unclear what agency they were from, they're in full uniform, in many cases, with a mask pulled up over the bridge of their nose,\" said Barnette. \"So Brad, I assume, was saying, 'I am an American citizen, I am asking you for the judicial warrant, you do not have grounds to arrest me.'\"",
      "Lander has been going to immigration court on separate occasions for several weeks after a number of undocumented immigrants, including a Bronx public school student named Dylan, were arrested by masked ICE agents after showing up to routine hearings.",
      "Public Advocate Jumaane Williams joined the news conference and said, \"Thank you to Brad Lander.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, all the power we have is to be present and to witness what is happening. And everyone of any moral character, any moral consciousness will be thanking Brad Lander for being that witness and using what he could where he was with what he had to try to help someone,\" Williams said. \"What is happening in this country, what is happening in that building is simply unacceptable.\"",
      "Lander's rabbi was also at the courthouse as an observer and spoke during the news conference.",
      "\"I share the public advocate's view that I have never been as proud of him as I am today, and I've known him in many situations,\" said Rabbi Ellen Lippmann. \"I have never been as ashamed to be an American or a New Yorker as I feel today, except for the uprising from all the incredible New Yorkers who represent the good and the true and the right in this city.\"",
      "What advocates allege is happening in immigration court",
      "Barnette described seeing multiple cases where the person is told that their case is dismissed and they have 30 days to appeal, but said they were then met by agents waiting for them in the hallway.",
      "\"What I saw happen, repeatedly, there and what I understand from other stories has continued to happen is that these folks have pending asylum cases, they are told, 'Your case is dismissed.' That sounds like good news. It is not good news. What that means is that you are subject to immediate removal when you leave the courtroom,\" she explained. \"And the ICE agents are lining the hallway, and that is not explained to people.\"",
      "\"They are kidnapping our neighbors off of the street. They are bamboozling them, they are tricking them to tell them to come here and something good will happen. And when they hear the court news, they believe something good has happened. And then they're faced with people in fatigues, with masks on their faces, and they're taken, having not understood even what just happened legally and what their recourse is,\" added Williams. \"That is something that we all have to stand up against.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is emphasizing her life and career as she aims to become the next governor of Virginia at a time when her national party is searching for answers on how to win over voters after an election cycle filled with setbacks.",
      "The Spanberger campaign's new advertisement for the general election, first reported by CBS News, shows her reflecting on the various kinds of hallways she's walked through, starting with her education at Virginia's J.R. Tucker High School, before quickly pivoting to the CIA, where she was a case officer, and then to the Capitol, where she was a bipartisan-minded U.S. House representative.",
      "\"As governor, I'll work to lower costs and make sure our schools prepare all our kids for jobs of the future,\" Spanberger said in the advertisement.",
      "According to the campaign, the advertisement is set to run in the Norfolk and Richmond markets along with digital platforms.",
      "The messaging approach comes as Spanberger prepares to try and introduce herself to a wider range of voters with less than five months to go before this fall's off year election. Before running for governor, Spanberger served three terms in Congress after unseating a Republican incumbent in the 2018 midterm elections.",
      "Over the last 25 years, Virginia has shifted from backing Republicans in presidential elections to Democrats. That has not been the case in races for governor however, with the office shifting back and forth between the two major parties over the same period of time.",
      "The state's gubernatorial contests, which take place in the off year after presidential elections, have long been viewed as political bellwethers, with voters typically favoring a governor from the party opposite the president. That pattern has held in nearly every presidential election since 1980, from Ronald Reagan to Joe Biden. Most recently, Republican Glenn Youngkin's 2021 victory was seen as an early warning sign for Democrats ahead of their midterm challenges.",
      "Strategists from both parties see this year's outcome as a test of the national mood \u2014 and of messaging on key issues ranging from abortion, crime and education to the economy and immigration.",
      "Youngkin's 2021 victory over then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when backlash against Democrats during the early days of the Biden administration appeared to energize Republican voters. Under Virginia law, a governor cannot serve for two consecutive terms, which has resulted in open races for the office without the advantage of incumbency.",
      "Virginia GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running to be Youngkin's successor, is facing both a challenging national political climate in her attempt to keep the governor's office under Republican control during the second Trump administration and a notable local dynamic. Republicans haven't won two straight races for governor in the Commonwealth since George Allen and Jim Gilmore did so in the 1993 and 1997 elections.",
      "\"We are going to win this in November and make sure we keep common sense, conservative policies in the governor's seat,\" Earle-Sears said in a recent social media post. \"Virginia is thriving, and I will continue to grow our long list of successes as governor.\"",

This is the deployment of the second set of 2000 federalized Guard soldiers, under the June 9 order.

      "The downtown protests\u00a0were in response\u00a0to a series of immigration raids throughout the L.A. area.",

      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection. But they remain far below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by the White House.",

      "The Justice Department lost 4,000 employees in the Trump administration's controversial government downsizing initiative, and critics worry those cuts will impact safety in U.S. communities.",
      "The so-called \"fork in the road\" deferred resignation program, which incentivized some employees to leave federal government service, reduced the manpower in the agency for an estimated savings of $470 million, according to a department budget summary reviewed by CBS News.",
      "Further reductions are planned, according to the summary, including 1,500 positions to be eliminated in the FBI. More than 700 vacant FBI agent positions are to be part of those cuts.",
      "The reductions have been championed by the new leadership inside the Justice Department.\tIn the agency's budget summary, referred to the cuts as part of a streamlining and right-sizing process.",
      "\"Capitalizing on increased efficiency, FBI will prioritize core missions of securing the border, eliminating transnational criminal organizations, reinforcing national security, and protecting the American people from violent crime,\" the department said in the summary.",
      "The cuts represent a small percentage of an agency that has approximately 105,000 employees. But former officials and law enforcement analysts said they're draining the Justice Department of experienced agents and leaders.",

      "Young is the executive director of Justice Connections, an advocacy group made up of former Justice Department employees.",
      "Thomas Chittum, a former assistant director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, called the cuts \"shortsighted.\" He predicted the reductions in staff \"would immediately diminish investigative capacity\" and also \"undermine long-term effectiveness\" because fewer senior agents would overlap with new agents. This, he said, has been \"critical to transferring hard-earned institutional knowledge.\"",
      "\"No one becomes a seasoned investigator overnight,\" Chittum said. \"We should not mortgage the future of federal law enforcement for short-term cost savings.\"",
      "Congress must still approve funding for the Justice Department, including the FBI, and will review the budget requests and recommendations submitted by the agency.",

It was founded during the civil rights era in the mid-20th century, and its mission is to be \"America's peacemaker,\" tasked with \"preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, conflicts, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.\"",
      "Former Justice Department official Bert Brandenburg blasted the agency's plans to close this office.\u00a0 \"Sacking expert conciliators on the eve of a summer of growing tension is like turning off fire hydrants as flames approach,\" Brandenburg told CBS News. \"This is a recipe for more chaos and more violence.\"",

      "He testified that it would \"increase the investigative capacity in 49 of our 55 field offices.\"",
      "Some employees who opted for the administration's \"fork in the road\" resignation program criticized rapid and controversial changes in the agency. \tFormer Justice Department spokesman Joshua Stueve, who resigned in February, wrote in his resignation letter, \"[I]t has been an honor to serve this department under multiple administrations led by both Republicans and Democrats, each of whom have previously treated career staff with respect and dignity. It is heartbreaking to see that basic decency come to an end.\"",
      "In its Jan. 28 letter to federal employees, the White House Office of Management and Budget explained its efforts to reduce some of the federal workforce, including inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"At this time, we cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency but should your position be eliminated you will be treated with dignity and will be afforded the protections in place for such positions,\" the letter read. \"If you choose not to continue in your current role in the federal workforce, we thank you for your service to your country and you will be provided with a dignified, fair departure from the federal government utilizing a deferred resignation program.\"",

      "\"It is important for your office to know much additional pain you've caused on an unspeakably horrific weekend,\" said the email, which CBS News obtained. \"Why would you use the awesome power of a United States Senator office to compound on people's grief?\"",
      "Smith, asked whether she had considered elevating the incident to leadership, said she hadn't thought about it, adding that \"I hope that my talking with him will cause him to think more about the hateful things that he has been putting out on his personal X account that really should have no place in our public discourse.\"",

And he used the person who murdered their parents as a way to, you know, accomplish some, you know, something on social media that was just only to benefit him,\" she told Garrett. \"It's shameful.\"",
      "Smith also criticized President Trump for \"pardoning people who attacked our \u2014 the base of our government operations and people who committed assault against police officers.\"",
      "\"The dynamic of what this really means in our country today just seems very, very challenging,\" she told Garrett. \"I think we're at a tipping point. We can either take a step back and try to figure out how to reclaim the civic ground, or we are gonna inevitably continue down this path of more violence and more chaos. And we cannot let that be the path that we choose.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke about Lee's post on the Senate floor Monday, saying he was \"deeply disappointed and sickened to see a member of this chamber use the tragedy in Minnesota to take cheap political shots at the other side on social media, and risk escalating a perilous moment.\"",
      "\"What the senior senator from Utah posted after the shooting was reckless and beneath the dignity of his office,\" Schumer said, urging Lee to take down his posts.",
      "Lee did not respond to questions from reporters about his conversation with Smith at the Capitol on Monday. Smith, asked about Lee's reaction, said, \"Honestly, he seemed a little surprised to be confronted.\"",

      "An Afghan man who worked alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers last week in San Diego.",
      "In a video obtained by CBS News, two unidentified ICE agents put Sayed Naser in handcuffs and escorted him from the federal courthouse in downtown San Diego after he attended a mandatory immigration hearing on Wednesday, June 11.",
      "\"For more than three years I worked for the U.S. military back in my home country,\" Naser said in the video as the masked officers took him into custody. \"I came here to make a better life. I didn't know this was going to happen like this for me.\"",

      "Naser was legally paroled into the U.S in 2024, according to his lawyer, Brian McGoldrick. In addition to an active asylum case, he has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case because of his long history supporting the U.S. military. SIVs are provided to foreign nationals who worked with U.S. military forces\u00a0in war zones including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Naser has no criminal record in the U.S. or Afghanistan, according to court records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This man served with our troops. He came through the front door. He followed every rule. And we locked him up anyway,\" said Shawn VanDiver, executive director for #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for U.S. wartime allies. He said it's unknown how many Afghan allies have been detained by ICE officials.",
      "The Department for Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2015 to 2018. He and his brothers also co-owned a logistics company that provided anti-mining support to American troops, according to employment records viewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This individual was an important part of our Company commitment to provide the best possible service for our clients, who were the United States Military in Afghanistan,\" says one employment document submitted as part of Naser's SIV application.",
      "But after the U.S. withdrew from the country in August 2021, his partnership with American forces put targets on the backs of Naser and his family. In 2023, Taliban fighters killed his brother and abducted his father at a family wedding. The attack drove Naser out of the country and forced his wife and children to flee their home.",
      "\"I cannot return to Afghanistan under any circumstances because I am accused of collaborating with U.S. forces. From the Taliban's perspective, anyone who worked with foreign forces during the past 20 years is a spy, an infidel, and must be killed,\" Naser wrote in his asylum declaration. His family remains in hiding outside of Afghanistan.",
      "After his brother was killed, Naser fled to Brazil, where he was granted a humanitarian visa. He then made the more than 6,000 mile journey on foot through the Dari\u00e9n Gap before reaching Mexico. In 2024, he set up an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app formerly known as CBP One \u2014 which allowed migrants to schedule appointments at legal ports of entry \u2014 where he was granted lawful parole into the U.S.",
      "As part of his asylum process, Naser was required to attend an in-person hearing last week in front of a judge and a lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security. But when Naser showed up to court, the DHS lawyer said that his case was \"'improvidently issued.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what that means,\" said McGoldrick, who tried to dispute the ruling. When pressed, the DHS lawyer refused to clarify further.",
      "\"'Improvidently issued' is becoming ICE's new catch-all \u2014 a vague, unchallengeable justification being used to clear dockets and meet removal and detention quotas,\" said VanDiver. \"It's being weaponized to put lawful, parole-compliant asylum-seekers in cells.\"",
      "When Naser left the courtroom after his hearing ended, he was immediately detained by ICE agents.",
      "Naser is now being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. According to McGoldrick, he could be kept there for up to three months while his asylum case is adjudicated. If he is denied asylum, Naser will be put on an expedited removal list and likely deported. His lawyer does not know where he would be deported to, and DHS did not respond to our request for more information.",
      "\"He's still in shock. He cannot believe this is happening to him,\" McGoldrick said.",
      "Naser's wife, who remains in hiding with their children, found out about her husband's detention when she saw the video of his detainment on social media.",
      "Increase in arrests in courthouses",
      "The last few weeks have seen an increase in ICE arrests outside of immigration hearings in courthouses around major American cities. In May, CBS News reported that the Trump administration was launching an operation to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by dismissing their cases and subsequently arresting them at courthouses around the country. The move shocked immigration advocates, as their clients are legally required to show up at their hearings.",
      "Public arrests outside courts in Los Angeles led to more than a week of demonstrations as protesters faced off against thousands of law enforcement officials, including the National Guard.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump called on ICE to increase arrests in order to achieve his goal of the \"largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History,\" according to a post on Truth Social, the social media platforms he owns.",
      "Reports from within the administration say that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been pushing agencies since late May to meet a higher quota of deportations \u2014 including as much as 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.",
      "Typically, ICE agents need probable cause in order to detain someone to check their immigration status. This requires a higher standard of evidence pointing to an individual's alleged violation of immigration law.",
      "It's not clear in Naser's case what evidence there is that he was violating the law, his lawyer said. ICE provided a warrant for Naser's arrest to his attorney outside the courtroom after he was detained.",
      "\"It's really shocking what's happening in courthouses in San Diego and around the country,\" said McGoldrick. \"You walk down the hall and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all these armed personnel just eyeballing everybody as we come down. It's just so intimidating that our clients are terrorized.\"",
      "Uncertain future for thousands of Afghans",
      "The Trump administration has demonstrated a sharp turn away from supporting Afghans who worked with the U.S. government in the military's two-decade-long conflict with the Taliban.",
      "In May, Noem announced that the administration was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. TPS is an immigration designation that allows people from countries deemed dangerous by the U.S. to live and work in the United States without being detained by DHS. Nearly 11,000 Afghans who are in the U.S. under TPS will be at risk of deportation when the change in policy comes into effect in mid-July, said VanDiver.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration also instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, citing a need to address security concerns. Ahead of this announcement, over 100,000 Afghan wartime allies and their families had been vetted and cleared to enter the U.S., says #AfghanEvac. They are now unable to travel to the U.S. unless they are granted an SIV visa and can fund their own travel, without government support. Many live in danger of retribution from the Taliban.",
      "\"Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,\" said VanDiver. \"The United States cannot abandon its allies and call that immigration policy.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 18:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has ignored a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. A deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the president would sign the latest executive order this week delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days, marking the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "The current extension expires Thursday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",

      "Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support that gave ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court days before it took effect.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:50:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The bill was stalled for weeks amid Democratic pushback and contentious amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate crypto after a bumpy path through the upper chamber.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would establish a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "It passed the Senate in a 68 to 30 vote.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who introduced the measure, said the legislation \"ushers in a new era of payments.\"",
      "\"The prospect of faster and cheaper payments will have far-reaching implications for our financial system,\" he said Tuesday. \"Once the GENIUS Act is law, businesses of all sizes and Americans across the country will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously, rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks. Put simply, stablecoins are a paradigm-shifting development that can bring our payment system into the 21st century.\"",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "In early May, Democrats prevented the legislation from advancing, leading to weeks of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes that convinced enough Democrats to come back on board and help propel it through several procedural votes.",
      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",
      "More than 100 amendments were offered from Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from barring the president, vice president and other top government officials from profiting from stablecoin ventures while in office to prohibiting large online platforms from issuing the digital assets.",
      "Two Republicans have also consistently voted against the legislation \u2014 Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 albeit for different reasons. Paul doesn't see a need for federal regulation of the industry, while Hawley has warned that it cedes too much power to tech giants.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, who worked on the bill, defended the framework as long overdue.",
      "\"To date, Congress' failure to act has left the digital asset space as a wild West, where American consumers are vulnerable to scams and businesses are desperate for the regulatory clarity they need to compete with foreign countries, foreign entities that do business in our markets, effectively. Doing nothing and protecting the status quo is not only irresponsible, it's unacceptable,\" she said on the Senate floor last week.",
      "Gillibrand acknowledged that Mr. Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere is \"extremely unhelpful\" but argued it \"does not diminish the excellent work in this legislation.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 16:57:33 -0400",
    "summary": "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit heard arguments on whether President Trump must return control of California National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in San Francisco weighed Tuesday whether President Trump can continue with his deployment of California's National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities during enforcement operations and appeared skeptical of the state's arguments against the president's mobilization of more than 4,000 troops.",
      "The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit heard arguments on a Justice Department request for it to halt a district judge's order that required Mr. Trump to return control of the National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom while the court fight moves forward. Newsom, a Democrat, objects to the federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles.",
      "Brett Shumate, an assistant attorney general with the Justice Department, said Mr. Trump's decision to call National Guard troops into federal service under a law known as Title 10 is unreviewable by courts, regardless of the facts of the case. If the panel were to side with California, he warned, \"it puts Article III judges on a collision course with the commander-in-chief.\"",
      "Shumate said that California's interpretation of the law is \"dangerous\" and would allow Newsom to issue a \"pocket veto\" of any future orders from Mr. Trump. He said it's \"essential\" that the district court's injunction be lifted and said leaving it intact would put \"lives and property at risk.\"",
      "Shumate said that if the 9th Circuit declines to halt the district judge's order, it should allow the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "But Sam Harbourt, a deputy solicitor general for California, said Mr. Trump's order calling the National Guard into federal service sweeps too broadly. He told the court that the president failed to consider any \"modest measures\" to quell protests in Los Angeles before taking the \"grave and extraordinary step\" of calling forth the National Guard.",
      "Harbourt told the judges that Mr. Trump circumvented Newsom when he unilaterally decided to deploy the California National Guard to Los Angeles and warned that the continued presence of troops in city streets would escalate tensions and the risk of violence.",
      "The three judges considering the Trump administration's request for a stay during the appeal are Judges Mark Bennett, Eric Miller and Jennifer Sung. Mr. Trump appointed Bennett and Miller during his first term, and former President Joe Biden tapped Sung for the 9th Circuit.",
      "Early on, Bennett appeared skeptical of the Trump administration's position that courts cannot review the president's decision to federalize the National Guard and should not second-guess his military judgments. But as the arguments continued, all three judges pressed Harbourt on his position.",
      "Bennett asked where in the law there is a requirement for the president to have considered alternative measures before exercising control of the National Guard. He also probed Harbourt on his claim that Title 10 required Mr. Trump to consult with Newsom before calling the California troops into federal service.",
      "Miller cited a state law that he said effectively makes the adjutant general of the California National Guard a \"substitute\" for the governor. Mr. Trump had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to effectuate the federalization of Guard troops, and he then issued memoranda to the adjutant general to transfer authority over the Guard from the state to the federal government.",
      "The case landed before the 9th Circuit after U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled last week that Mr. Trump's actions in deploying the National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles were illegal and blocked the administration from deploying the troops in the city.",
      "The Trump administration swiftly appealed that decision, and the 9th Circuit panel issued a temporary administrative stay while it took more time to consider the issue.",
      "The legal battle involves whether the president exceeded his authority when he invoked Title 10 to call forth the California National Guard in response to protests in California's largest city. Demonstrations broke out earlier this month after immigration agents conducted raids across Los Angeles as part of the administration's efforts to crack down on immigration and execute mass deportations.",
      "Title 10 lays out three circumstances under which the National Guard can be called into federal service: when the U.S. is invaded or in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; when there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the U.S.; or when the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws. It then says that orders \"shall be issued through\" the governor.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his June 7 memorandum ordering the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members that the protests in Los Angeles \"constitute a form of rebellion,\" which allowed him to federalize the National Guard and bypass Newsom. An additional 2,000 troops were brought under federal command. Roughly 700 active-duty U.S. Marines have also been mobilized to the area to protect federal property and immigration agents during arrests.",
      "In his decision, Breyer rejected the president's claim that the demonstrations are a \"rebellion,\" writing that he is \"troubled by the implication inherent in defendants' argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion.\"",
      "The protests, the judge said, \"fall far short\" of rebellion, and the administration failed to identify a \"violent, armed, organized, open and avowed uprising against the government as a whole.\" The judge's order did not address the president's mobilization of the Marines to Los Angeles.",
      "In filings with the 9th Circuit, the Trump administration argued that courts do not have a role in reviewing the president's decision to deploy the troops. Even if courts could review his decision to call the National Guard into federal service, the Justice Department said the president had ample reason to determine that the protests in Los Angeles rose to the level of a \"danger\" of rebellion, one of the conditions laid out in Title 10.",
      "\"The district court's order improperly impinges on the commander in chief's supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the Held, and puts federal officers (and others) in harm's way,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "Newsom and California officials told the 9th Circuit in filings that Breyer's order should be left undisturbed, as it restored the status quo in place before Mr. Trump's June 7 memorandum.",
      "\"Considered individually, defendants' legal arguments are meritless. Considered in the aggregate, they are terrifying,\" California lawyers wrote. They said that the administration's interpretation of Title 10 \"would empower the president to commandeer a state's National Guard based merely on evidence that some civilians opposed his authority, disobeyed his commands, or presented operational difficulties for civil law enforcement officials \u2014 and without any input from (or even notice to) the governor. \"",
      "They said that \"unchecked power\" could be used in any context, \"not just where civilians are protesting immigration enforcement, but also where they are protesting other policies of a federal administration, or protesting in advance of a hotly contested federal election.\"",
      "\"Collectively, defendants' arguments would sideline the judiciary, ignore Congress's limitations, and trample over the states' sovereign interest in their own militias,\" California's attorneys argued.",
      "Among the issues before the 9th Circuit panel is whether the Trump administration properly notified Newsom of its order calling the National Guard into federal service. The Justice Department argued in lower court proceedings that it did because two memos calling up the National Guard went through California's adjutant general, who runs the California National Guard, and not Newsom's office, as California has argued is necessary.",
      "That argument, Breyer wrote, \"strains credibility\" because Congress mandates that the National Guard requires the notice to be \"issued through the governors.\"",

      "\"The ideologically motivated directives to terminate grants alleged to constitute DEI, 'gender ideology,' or other forbidden topics were, in fact, arbitrary and capricious, and have now been ruled unlawful,\" Dr. Peter Lurie, head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a statement Tuesday. Lurie's group was among those that filed the lawsuit.",
      "Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts capped a trial Monday for multiple lawsuits that were filed against the Trump administration: one by a coalition of public health groups and another by several Democratic state attorneys general.",

      "\"HHS is exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal and moving to stay the order,\" Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.",
      "Nixon said the department \"stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people,\" saying the department wanted taxpayer dollars to support \"gold standard science\" and not \"divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology.\"",
      "The court has not yet published Young's order in the case, but notes from the clerk announced that the challenged directives have been vacated and that the Trump administration was ordered to \"promptly comply.\"",

      "\"These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens,\" the president wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump's declaration comes after weeks of increased enforcement, and after Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of the president's immigration policies, said ICE officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration has directed ICE to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's\u00a0crackdown\u00a0on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News.

    "summary": "If initial results hold up, NASA says the delayed launch of a commercial research mission to the station could come as early as Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "NASA is evaluating apparently successful efforts by Russian cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station to seal up small-but-persistent air leaks in a vestibule leading to an aft docking port, the U.S. space agency said Saturday.",
      "Pending additional analysis to verify the initial results, NASA said in a blog post the delayed launch of the privately-funded Axiom-4 research mission to the station could come as early as Thursday.",
      "The agency did not provide any additional launch details, but based on the space station's orbit and rendezvous requirements, a Thursday takeoff would be targeted for 4:53 a.m. EDT.",
      "If that schedule holds up, commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu would aim for a docking at the space-facing port of the station's Harmony module around 10:30 a.m. on Friday.",
      "The flight originally was planned for last Tuesday but it was repeatedly delayed, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by troubleshooting to find an oxygen leak in the first stage of the crew's Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "While SpaceX worked to resolve the oxygen propellant leak, NASA managers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to stop or minimize air leaks in a Russian vestibule, known as the PrK, that serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019 and up to now, efforts to seal them off have been unsuccessful. But on Friday, Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, reported cosmonauts aboard the station had successfully eliminated the leaks in the PrK.",
      "\"Following the most recent repair, pressure in the transfer tunnel has been stable,\" NASA confirmed in a blog post Saturday. \"This could indicate the small leaks have been sealed.\"",
      "The leak rates seen earlier could be related to \"a small amount of air flowing into the transfer tunnel across the hatch seal from the main part of the station,\" NASA said.",
      "\"By changing pressure in the transfer tunnel and monitoring over time, teams are evaluating the condition of the transfer tunnel configuration, resulting in an updated launch opportunity for the private astronaut mission.\"",
      "The flight is the fourth Crew Dragon launch chartered by Houston-based Axiom Space. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries.",
      "They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab.",
      "\"We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,\" Whitson said. \"The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station.\"",

    "story": [
      "Concern about a small but persistent air leak in a Russian compartment of the International Space Station has prompted NASA and Axiom Space to indefinitely delay this week's launch of a commercial flight to the orbiting outpost, officials said Thursday.",
      "The privately-financed Axiom-4 crew \u2014 commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu \u2014 originally planned to take off Tuesday.",
      "But the flight was delayed to the end of the week, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by an oxygen leak in their Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX tentatively targeted Thursday and then Friday for launch, with Saturday and Sunday available if needed.",
      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

    "summary": "Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, said he expects the company to reduce its workforce over the next few years as it rolls out more generative AI and agents.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon's CEO envisions an \"agentic future\" in which AI robots, or agents, replace humans working in the company's offices.",
      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",
      "Jassy's pledge to invest in AI comes after the company announced in May that it would cut 100 jobs in its devices and services\u00a0unit, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed.",

As the\u00a0Black Lives Matter movement gained renewed power across the country and abroad the previous year with the police killings of Black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, public calls grew louder for the federal government to acknowledge emancipation as the critical turning point it was in U.S. history. Advocates sought, again, for leaders to codify the Juneteenth holiday into law, decades after communities began to push for broader recognition of Juneteenth as an emblem of unity, power and resilience in the wake of the police beating of Rodney King in 1991.",
      "Federal recognition came in 2021. A bill to solidify Juneteenth National Independence Day as a legal public holiday passed almost unanimously through both chambers of Congress before being signed by President Biden on June 18. At a White House ceremony held for the occasion, Mr. Biden said: \"All Americans can feel the power of this day, and learn from our history.\" It was the first time a national holiday was established in the U.S. since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was set to honor the late civil rights leader's birthday in 1983.",
      "Juneteenth became a legal federal holiday in the U.S. on the eve of its earliest nationwide observance, on June 19, 2021, and it is observed and celebrated each year on that same date. Some upcoming celebrations for the 2025 holiday are expected to be smaller than they were in years past, as corporate sponsors taper their support for Juneteenth events amid wider political efforts to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Pride Month sponsorships have followed a similar pattern.",
      "Despite any funding changes, Juneteenth festivities are still set to draw crowds across the country for at least the fourth time in a row. And communities in a number of places have been celebrating for much longer than that: New York City kicked off its 16th annual Juneteenth festival last weekend with a parade across Brooklyn, and will host a range of activities through June 19.",
      "The origins of Juneteenth",
      "The name Juneteenth is a portmanteau that combines the words June and nineteenth. Its origins date back to June 19, 1865, when the last group of people enslaved in the southern U.S. were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation more than two years earlier, on Jan. 1, 1863, declaring that everyone held as a slave was, and would continue to be, free.",
      "The proclamation took effect as the country neared its second year of the Civil War and technically applied to enslaved people in Confederate states. However, it could not actually be implemented in Confederate territory, and the war would not end in victory for the Union Army until much later, in the spring of 1865. In Texas, the westernmost state controlled by the Confederacy, news of freedom and the tenets of the Emancipation Proclamation arrived that summer. On June 19, thousands of Union soldiers reached Galveston Bay, along the northeastern coast of Texas in the Gulf of Mexico, and announced that all enslaved people in the state were freed by executive order.",
      "At the time, more than 250,000 Black people were being held as slaves in Texas alone, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which writes in a description of the holiday that the \"historical legacy of Juneteenth shows the value of never giving up hope in uncertain times.\" Once the Emancipation Proclamation laid its roots in Texas, those freed from slavery declared the day of its arrival \"Juneteenth\" in homage to the date when it finally happened.",
      "Although the Emancipation Proclamation set the stage, critically, for an end to slavery throughout the U.S., it was the 13th Amendment to the Constitution that actually did it. The amendment's passage through Congress and across Lincoln's desk began in January 1865. It was ratified in December of that year, abolishing slavery nationwide.",
      "How to celebrate Juneteenth",
      "Observing Juneteenth each year on June 19 does memorialize that specific day in Galveston in 1865, but it is also symbolic. Many regard the holiday as a joyful anniversary of independence and an opportunity to remember the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.",
      "Historically, communities in different parts of the U.S. have celebrated Emancipation Day on different dates, a tradition that nodded to the fact that news of the Emancipation Proclamation reached people enslaved by the Confederacy at different times after the Civil War. In Florida, for example, advocates in 2021 pushed for the state to recognize and observe Emancipation Day on May 20, because that was the date in 1865 when news of Lincoln's executive decree reached enslaved people there. Washington, D.C., has in the past observed a city-wide Emancipation Day on April 16.",
      "Juneteenth celebrations vary. Public festivities often include parades, parties, concerts, educational workshops and other cultural events centered on art and cuisine. For some, commemorating Juneteenth is mainly about tapping into the spirit of the holiday. Koritha Mitchell, an English professor at Ohio State University who celebrated Juneteenth growing up in a small town outside of Houston, told CBS News in 2021 that, for her, the day revolved around family and \"creating community and connection.\"",
      "Opal Lee, the retired teacher and counselor whose activism played a huge role in Juneteenth becoming a federally recognized holiday, recalled joyful memories of the annual celebrations in the Texas town where she lived as a child.",
      "\"When I was a little one and we lived in Marshall, Texas, we'd go to the fairground,\" she said in a\u00a0CBS News interview\u00a0in 2022. \"There'd be games and food and food and food. I'm here to tell ya it was like Christmas!\"",
      "Lee, now 97, became known as the \"Grandmother of Juneteenth\" for her famous trek from Fort Worth, Texas, to Washington, D.C., to ultimately deliver 1.5 million signatures to Congress advocating for a law to make the date a federal holiday. She shared her thoughts on the essence of Juneteenth in that 2022 interview.",
      "\"People think it's a Black thing when it's not. It's not a Texas thing. It's not that,\" Lee said. \"Juneteenth means freedom, and I mean for everybody!\"",
      "Unlike previous years, Lee will not lead this year's Walk for Freedom in Fort Worth, Texas, after being hospitalized in May for unknown reasons, CBS News Texas reported. Her granddaughter, Dione Sims, told the station that she will lead the walk in her grandmother's place, \"carrying on her legacy.\"",

The steel will continue to be \"mined, melted and made\" in the United States, the companies said. The partnership is expected to create more than 100,000 jobs throughout the U.S., and will feature \"unprecedented massive investments in steelmaking in the United States,\" the companies said in their announcement.",
      "A deal between Nippon and U.S. Steel was first proposed in late 2023. Then-President Joe Biden\u00a0rejected the deal\u00a0on national security grounds near the end of his time in office, but President Trump\u00a0ordered a new review\u00a0of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities\u00a0rather than fully acquiring\u00a0the company.",
      "On June 13, Mr. Trump cleared the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel. The companies say they have \"now completed the transaction as contemplated by their merger agreement.\"",
      "The companies have also entered into a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government.",
      "Under that agreement, Nippon Steel has agreed to make about $11 billion in new investments in U.S. Steel by 2028, including an initial investment in a greenfield project that will be completed after 2028, they said. The agreement also requires that the majority of members of U.S. Steel's board of directors and key management personnel, including its CEO, be U.S. citizens, and says that U.S. Steel will remain a U.S.-incorporated entity.",
      "Takashi Mori, Nippon Steel's representative director and vice chairman, will serve as chairman of the board of U.S. Steel, according to the news release.",
      "The United Steelworkers union issued a statement accusing the companies of \"down-playing concerns\" about what the deal would mean over the long-term.",

We will continue watching, holding Nippon to its commitments. And we will use the most powerful tool workers have against global corporations: collective bargaining.\" The union's current contract agreement expires in September 2026.",
      "The deal announced Wednesday requires that U.S. Steel maintain capacity to produce and supply steel from U.S. production locations to meet market demand in the country, and says that Nippon Steel will not \"prevent, prohibit, or otherwise interfere with U.S. Steel's ability to pursue trade action under U.S. law.\"",
      "The company will also issue a \"golden share\" to the U.S. government, which will give the president the power to approve or veto a number of major corporate decisions, and gives the U.S. government the right to appoint one independent director.",
      "The deal comes as Mr. Trump recently doubled tariffs on foreign steel imports.",
      "\"This is a momentous day for our country, our communities, and the American steel industry,\" said U.S. Steel CEO Dave Burritt in a news release announcing the partnership details. \"Thanks to President Trump's bold leadership, American workers secured the best possible deal.

    "published": "Wed, 18 Jun 2025 11:43:54 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled against Texas and landowners who challenged a plan to store thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste at a facility in the state.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a challenge brought by Texas and a group of landowners to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to temporarily store thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste at a facility in the state.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a decision for a 6-3 court in the case of NRC v. Texas\t that neither Texas nor a land developer were parties to the commission's licensing proceeding, and therefore are not entitled to obtain judicial review. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.",
      "The court reversed a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that allowed the case to move forward and ordered the lower court to deny or dismiss the petitions for review filed by Texas and the landowners. It did not address a second matter raised in the dispute regarding whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the authority to license private companies to store nuclear waste offsite.",
      "\"In short, the Hobbs Act affords judicial review to those who were parties before the commission. Here, obtaining party status required Texas or Fasken to successfully intervene in the commission proceeding,\" Kavanaugh wrote for the six-justice majority. \"Because neither Texas nor Fasken successfully intervened, they may not obtain judicial review of the commission's licensing decision under the Hobbs Act.\"",
      "The Hobbs Act is a 1950 law that dictates when a \"party aggrieved\" by an agency's final order can seek review from a federal appeals court.",
      "How to address the problem of nuclear waste has been complicated by politics since the advent of nuclear power last century. In 1982, Congress enacted a law requiring the federal government to establish a permanent facility to store spent nuclear fuel. Yucca Mountain in Nevada was later selected to house this repository.",
      "But the site hasn't yet been established amid pushback from the state, and the project was halted during the Obama administration. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will seek to restart the Yucca Mountain project.",
      "The issue of where to put the increasing amount of spent fuel remains. More than 90,000 metric tons of nuclear waste from commercial power plants are currently privately stored, both at or away from nuclear reactor sites, according to the Government Accountability Office. Plants continue to generate an additional 2,000 metric tons of spent fuel each year, as nearly 20% of the nation's electricity is supplied by nuclear energy, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "Spent fuel from a nuclear reactor can remain radioactive and pose health risks for thousands of years,\u00a0according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "In September 2021, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a license to a company called Interim Storage Partners that allowed it to store 5,000 metric tons, and up to 40,000 metric tons, of nuclear waste in dry-cask, above-ground storage for up to 40 years.",
      "The facility would be built in Andrews County, Texas, located west of Dallas and near the New Mexico border. The area is already home to a disposal site for low-level radioactive waste.",
      "Before the commission granted the license, the state submitted comments opposing the storage site and warned against housing spent nuclear fuel on a \"concrete pad\" above Texas' Permian Basin, where 250,000 active oil and gas wells capture 40% of the nation's oil reserves.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott and the Texas Commission on Environmental Equality did not try to intervene during the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's proceedings. But other groups did try to object, including a company that owns land in the Permian Basin, though its request was denied by the commission.",
      "The state and landowners asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to review the government's license to Interim Storage Partners, and the court allowed the legal battle to proceed. The 5th Circuit also ruled that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not have the authority to issue a license that let nuclear waste to be held at privately owned facilities offsite from where the spent fuel was generated.",
      "Whether the commission could allow private companies to temporarily store nuclear waste was only one part of the dispute before the Supreme Court. The first, key issue for the justices to weigh was whether Texas and landowners who challenged the license to Interim Storage Partners could do so in the first place, since they didn't intervene at an earlier stage in the licensing process.",
      "The high court determined that Texas and the landowners could not seek judicial review of the commission's decision to issue Interim Storage Partners its license. Still, Kavanaugh noted that \"history and precedent\" offer support for the commission's interpretation that the Atomic Energy Act allows spent nuclear fuel to be stored offsite at private facilities.",
      "\"To be clear, because Texas and Fasken's claims are not judicially reviewable, we need not and do not decide the ultimate question of statutory authority that the dissent focuses on,\" he wrote for the six-justice majority. \"So that there is no confusion, however, we underscore that in resting on the threshold reviewability issue, we are not somehow assuming or buying into a premise that the commission is wrong on the underlying merits.\"",
      "Writing in dissent, Gorsuch, joined by Thomas and Alito, said that the commission's decision to issue the license to Interim Storage Partners was unlawful. Accepting the commission's argument that Texas and Fasken could not seek review of its licensing decision \"requires us to ignore the full scope of the agency's own licensing proceeding,\" he wrote.",
      "Gorsuch continued: \"It forces us to reimagine a statute expanding public access to the agency's administrative proceedings into one restricting access. And it asks us to believe that the very state in which the agency intends to store spent nuclear fuel indefinitely cannot be heard in court to complain about the agency's plans. Because nothing in the law requires us to indulge any of those fantasies, I respectfully dissent. \"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Tennessee law that restricts access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, a decision that is likely to have broad implications for access to medical treatments for transgender youth in half of the country.",
      "In the case of U.S. v. Skrmetti, high court ruled 6-3 to reject the challenge brought by the Biden administration, three families and a physician who had argued that Tennessee's law violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. The court concluded that the state's measure, which is known as SB1 and was enacted in 2023, does not run afoul of the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"Our role is not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.",
      "The court's majority found that Tennessee's law is not subject to a heightened level of judicial review and satisfies the most deferential standard, known as rational basis.",
      "\"We are asked to decide whether SB 1 is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause,\" Roberts wrote. \"We hold it is not. SB1 does not classify on the bases that warrant heightened review.\"",
      "The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, were in dissent. Sotomayor read her dissent from the bench.",
      "The court, Sotomayor wrote, \"obfuscates a sex classification that is plain on the face of this statute, all to avoid the mere possibility that a different court could strike down SB1, or categorical healthcare bans like it.\"",
      "Joined in her dissent by Kagan and Jackson, she continued: \"The court's willingness to do so here does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight. It also authorizes, without second thought, untold harm to transgender children and the parents and families who love them.\"",
      "The Tennessee law",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18. The state is one of 25 with laws that seek to restrict access to gender-affirming care for young people diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, marked the first in which the Supreme Court stepped into the politically charged debate over health care for transgender youth. In addition to the state prohibitions, President Trump has issued executive orders that address what he calls \"gender ideology.\" One declares that it is the federal government's policy to recognize \"two sexes, male and the female,\" and the second threatens federal funding for medical institutions that offer gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 18.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposals are being challenged in the federal courts.",
      "Known as SB1, Tennessee's law prevents health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state had argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "Shortly before the law took effect, three families with transgender children and a physician who provides the treatments to patients with gender dysphoria challenged the ban in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The Biden administration then intervened in the case.",
      "A federal district court blocked the law, finding that it discriminates based on sex and transgender status. A divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit then reversed that decision and allowed Tennessee's ban to take effect while legal proceedings continued.",
      "The appeals court evaluated the law under rational-basis review, the most deferential of the tiers of judicial scrutiny. But the Biden administration and the families had argued Tennessee's ban should be subject to a more stringent level of review, known as heightened scrutiny, because it draws lines based on sex and discriminates based on transgender status.",
      "But Tennessee had argued that the state aims to protect young people from the consequences of the medical treatments, which it said are risky and unproven. The state said it was setting age- and use-based limits on medical care and exercising its authority to regulate medicine.",
      "Access to gender-affirming care has become a flashpoint in the culture wars, as half of the states have in recent years enacted laws that limit the availability of the medical interventions. Many of those same states have also enacted measures prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.",
      "The court's decision",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority found that Tennessee's law classifies on the basis of age and medical use, since treatments like puberty blockers and hormones can be administered to treat certain conditions, but not gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder or gender incongruence.",
      "Classifications that turn on age or medical use are subject to only rational-basis review, the least demanding level of judicial review, it said.",
      "\"Under SB 1, no minor may be administered puberty blockers or hormones to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence; minors of any sex may be administered puberty blockers or hormones for other purposes,\" Roberts wrote.",
      "The majority said that Tennessee had \"plausible reasons\" for restricting access to gender-affirming care that brought its inquiry over the law's constitutionality to an end, namely concerns about the health risks. The justices said they wouldn't second-guess the legislature over the lines that the ban draws.",
      "\"Recent developments only underscore the need for legislative flexibility in this area,\" Roberts wrote, pointing to a report from England's National Health Service that evaluated the evidence regarding the use of puberty blockers and hormones and characterized it as \"remarkably weak.\"",
      "\"This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,\" he wrote. \"The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.\"",

      "\"There are thousands of volunteers of all political persuasions who serve on hundreds of these boards. That particular board has over 60 people on it. The Governor does not interview applicants for these roles and he does not know Boelter. They are not appointments to a position in the Governor's cabinet. These boards and commissions have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies.\"",

      "Schultz says people are oftentimes allowed to serve a couple of terms. Additionally, each board has different meeting requirements. Some meet just once a year, while others meet more frequently. And because these were statewide appointments, meetings often happened over Zoom, especially after the COVID pandemic.",

    "story": [
      "Authorities have released new images that they say may show what Travis Decker, the Washington state man suspected of killing his three young daughters, looks like after several weeks on the run.",
      "Investigators have been searching for Decker, 32, since May 30, when he failed to return the girls to their mother's home after a scheduled custody visit. Authorities found the bodies down an embankment at a campsite in the Cascade Mountains on June 2. A man's blood was discovered at the scene, investigators said.",
      "Attention quickly turned to Decker, who had been the last person to see the girls. Decker is a former soldier with extensive survival skills. The girls' mother, Whitney Decker, said in a petition to modify their parenting plan in September 2024 that Decker had worsening mental health issues and was becoming increasingly unstable.",
      "On Tuesday, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office, one of the agencies involved in the investigation, issued new images that they said showed how Travis Decker could have modified his appearance. One image shows Decker with a shaved head and no facial hair. Another shows him with a shaved head and thick mustache. A third shows him with shoulder-length hair, wearing a baseball cap.",
      "Previously released photos\u00a0and Ring camera footage taken in the days before his disappearance show Decker with facial hair, long dark hair gathered into a ponytail and tattoos. He is described as 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighing 190 pounds.",
      "The sheriff's office also said in a news release that the U.S. Marshals Service is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to Decker's arrest. The sheriff's office warned that Decker should be considered armed and dangerous, and said that anyone who sees him should not attempt to contact or approach him. Instead, they should call 911 immediately. Officials previously said they do not believe Decker poses a threat to public safety, but have warned some residents in remote areas to keep their doors and windows locked.",
      "The search for Decker continues, the sheriff's office said, with their detectives, members of the neighboring Kittitas County Sheriff's Office, the Washington Army National Guard and the Marshals Service taking part in the efforts. The sheriffs' offices have deployed personnel throughout the region and are processing evidence, reviewing data and conducting follow-up interviews. The Chelan County Sheriff's Office search and rescue and air support units have also been engaged in the investigation.",
      "The Kittitas County Sheriff's Office, which has experience searching for suspects in the woods, has placed \"numerous resources on the ground and in the air,\" the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said. The National Guard is providing air assets, conducting air surveillance and moving personnel into remote areas for tracking and searching. The Marshals Service has taken the lead role in the search for Decker, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office  said.",

      "FSIS is currently investigating and has not yet determined the source of contamination, according to the notice. The agency says it is working with public health partners to \"identify whether a specific ingredient in the chicken fettucine alfredo may be the source of this strain of Lm.\"",

    "summary": "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two measles vaccine doses, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "At least 3% of measles cases confirmed so far this year have been in people who received two doses of the measles vaccine, meaning they were fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two vaccine doses, the agency said Friday in its weekly update on cases. An additional 2% of cases were in people who received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.",
      "Many of the cases were in Texas, which on Tuesday\u00a0counted\u00a0a 21st confirmed measles case in someone with at least two doses of the vaccine.",
      "Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Monday that their first 20 cases were in children 8 years old or younger. Anton did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the additional case, which was reported on Tuesday.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said in an email their data reflects vaccination status at the time someone was exposed to the virus. This means none of the 36 vaccinated cases they confirmed Friday received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",
      "The CDC says people exposed to measles can get vaccinated within 72 hours of when they were first exposed, if they are not fully immunized. \"If administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, MMR vaccine might provide some protection against infection or modify the clinical course of disease,\" the agency's recommendations say.",
      "The CDC spokesperson said, \"The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.\"",
      "\"Disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people,\" the spokesperson said. \"People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.\"",
      "\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" the spokesperson said. \"People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.\"",
      "Texas has seen a deadly outbreak of the highly contagious virus this year. While cases there have recently slowed, CDC officials have said that authorities have been tracking more outbreaks in other communities across the U.S. linked to travel outside and inside the country.",
      "\"Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up,\" Brian Wakeman, deputy lead of the CDC's measles laboratory task force, said Monday.",
      "Wakeman, who spoke on a nationwide call for testing laboratories, said the U.S. is now on pace to top the 1,274 cases of measles seen in 2019. That was the most cases the U.S. has seen in a single year since endemic spread of the virus was declared \"eliminated\" at the end of the 20th century.",
      "\"We're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90s,\" Wakeman said.",
      "None of the confirmed measles cases that led to hospitalizations this year had documented evidence of receiving two doses of vaccine, the CDC spokesperson said. More than 8 in 10 of the cases have been in people 20 years old or older.",
      "Six cases of measles in people who received at least two doses of the vaccine were in Colorado, that state's health department says.",
      "\"None of the six cases with 2+ doses were seniors or required hospitalization,\" Hope Shuler, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email.",
      "Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" said Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Colorado says many of its vaccinated cases have been in residents who were exposed during travel to other parts of the world facing large outbreaks like Canada and Europe.",
      "The state previously said it had linked multiple cases to an infectious traveler who exposed others at Denver International Airport and on a Turkish Airlines flight.",
      "The CDC has\u00a0issued new guidance\u00a0for summer camps to prepare for the threat of measles spread this year, including urging camp operators to check for documentation of immunity among staff and children.",

      "Kelly was told he would need to stay at the hospital for seven days and was scheduled for a surgery for the clots, according to the motion. However, officers then came into his hospital room and removed Mr. Kelly.",
      "\"He was taken from the hospital against his will and against the directives of the doctors,\" Brindley said. \"Mr. Kelly's life is in jeopardy right now because the Bureau of Prisons denied him necessary surgery to clear clots from his lungs.

    "summary": "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, reversing a major policy pivot just a few days after issuing it internally, two sources familiar with the latest guidance told CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were told they could continue carrying out worksite enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants at farms, hotels and restaurants, as long as they are targeted in nature.",
      "The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said ICE officials were informed of the new guidance during a call Monday.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection. But they remain far below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by the White House.",

    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "\"The ideologically motivated directives to terminate grants alleged to constitute DEI, 'gender ideology,' or other forbidden topics were, in fact, arbitrary and capricious, and have now been ruled unlawful,\" Dr. Peter Lurie, head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a statement Tuesday. Lurie's group was among those that filed the lawsuit.",

      "The war has also sparked an exodus from Iran's capital Tehran with video showing thousands of vehicles at a near standstill on primary exit routes.

    "summary": "Iran has long been suspected of hiding work toward a nuclear weapon at its underground Fordo enrichment site.",
    "story": [
      "Iran has two known underground nuclear enrichment sites, the one Israel attacked on the first day of its assault at Natanz, and another at Fordo. Both sit south of Tehran in central Iran, but Fordo has long been the Iranian nuclear facility of most concern to international monitors and experts.",
      "Buried deep in a mountain, Fordo is where many analysts believe Iran has concealed clandestine efforts to work toward a nuclear weapons capability. There have been no reported Israeli strikes on the Fordo enrichment facility.",
      "As recently as March, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said American intelligence agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon, but Israel's military asserted hours after initiating its attack on Iran last week that the U.S. information was outdated, claiming Iran was \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\"",
      "Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin claimed Friday that the country had intelligence indicating the Iranian regime \"has established a secret program, within the framework of which senior nuclear scientists in Iran secretly conducted the experiments required to build nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters early Tuesday morning, President Trump appeared to have been swayed. Asked about the assessment Gabbard delivered in March, he said: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Iran's leaders have always denied any interest in building a nuclear weapon, insisting the program is for civilian purposes. But if that's obfuscation, as Israel insists, and the Iranians are close to a nuclear weapons capability, more than a decade of analysis of Iran's nuclear facilities by experts around the world suggests Fordo would be central to those efforts.",
      "Why is Iran's Fordo nuclear site such a concern?",
      "Two experts told CBS News in 2012 \u2014 the last time Netanyahu looked close to attacking Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 that Fordo, buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by significant air defenses, was the most likely location for a hypothetical nuclear weapons \"breakout\" program.",
      "Fordo is \"obviously for nuclear weapons hedging, to preserve centrifuges in case of an attack\" on other, more vulnerable facilities, Mark Fitzpatrick, an expert on Iran's nuclear program at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CBS News in 2012.",
      "Israel attacked the only other nuclear facility known to house significant uranium enrichment facilities in Iran last week, causing damage at Natanz.",
      "But the progress made at Fordo even at that stage, before the U.S.-brokered nuclear deal with Iran brought United Nations inspectors into the country, and since Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement during his first term, prompting an escalation of Iran's efforts, has remained unverified.",
      "The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts for the first time in 20 years just hours before Israel attacked. The lack of understanding of Iran's work at the facility has long been a concern, but those concerns have mounted in recent years, since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal spurred Iran to reduce cooperation with international inspectors and ramp up its enrichment.",
      "In late 2023, Manuel Herrera, a weapons non-proliferation expert with two different European think tanks, said Fordo remained \"one of the main concerns regarding Iran.\"",
      "\"Fordo has always been a major concern because of its location and because of its size,\" Herrera said during a discussion with fellow Iran expert William Alberque, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"We all knew from the beginning that Fordo was a site that aimed to enrich uranium for weapons purposes, because of its location, because of its size, because of its technical capacity. And\u2026 that the Iranians have been expanding that site and also expanding the stockpile of enriched uranium in that site, should be a concern for us because, actually, we don't have a lot of transparency on what's going on there.\"",
      "Herrera noted that, \"in contrast with Natanz, which is overground, Fordo is underground \u2014 it's a facility which actually has a tunnel structure.\"",
      "In addition to its well-fortified location and structure, Herrera said Fordo \"has always been assumed to be an enrichment plant with military purposes\" due to the machinery at the site.",
      "He noted that the Iranian regime had boasted in 2019 of installing advanced \"IR-6\" centrifuges at Fordo, capable of enriching uranium to higher purity levels much more quickly than most of its older equipment. In early 2023, the IAEA said it had found uranium particles at Fordo enriched to almost 84% purity, which is incredibly close to the 90% purity uranium that would be required for a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"This tells us that the Iranians at least are experimenting with this kind of uranium enriched level,\" Herrera said.",

      "Researchers have confirmed that the 18th-century British explorer Captain James Cook's lost ship found its final resting place in Rhode Island's Newport Harbor, solving a decadeslong mystery, according to the Australian National Maritime Museum.",
      "Two Australian historians, Mike Connell and Des Liddy, originally pinpointed the location of the ship, called HMS Endeavour\u00a0in 1998, the museum said in a report released earlier this month. The museum's report detailed how a 26-year archival and archaeological research program ultimately determined that the Endeavour was, in fact, at the bottom of Newport Harbor as Connell and Liddy had thought.",
      "Captain Cook famously sailed the Endeavour across the Pacific Ocean multiple times in the mid-1700s. He is remembered for his voyage to Tahiti, New Zealand and Australia, which he claimed for Britain, as well as Hawaii, where he ultimately met his fate in a dispute with indigenous residents. Cook's exploration of the islands laid the foundation for British colonization in those areas, which is why, for different reasons, it's an important part of Australian history, according to the museum's report.",
      "\"For some, the Pacific voyage led by James Cook between 1768 and 1771 embodies the spirit of Europe's Age of Enlightenment,\" the executive summary of the report reads, \"while for others it symbolises the onset of colonisation and the subjugation of First Nations Peoples.\"",
      "After Cook's death, the Endeavour returned to England, which went on to use it for transporting British troops and detaining prisoners during the American Revolutionary War. It was sold to private owners, who renamed the ship Lord Sandwich, and deliberately sunk in Newport Harbor in the midst of war in 1778.",
      "When Australian maritime experts\u00a0initially announced in 2022 that they believed the Endeavour was among a number of ancient shipwrecks still scattered across Newport Harbor, the claim was widely debated. But a partnership between the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission and the Australian National Maritime Museum forged ahead with the research that eventually led to the wreck's identification. They are working to ensure that the wreck site is protected from now on.",
      "\"Given Endeavour's historical and cultural significance to Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand, England, the United States of America and First Nations peoples throughout the Pacific Ocean, positive identification of its shipwreck site requires securing the highest possible level of legislative and physical protection,\" the report says.",

Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel would like to see, and even help to precipitate, a change of regime in Iran, which has been ruled by a hardline theocratic government since the 1979 Islamic revolution.",
      "On Friday, after ordering the first attacks on\u00a0Iran's nuclear sites, Netanyahu said: \"Israel's fight is not against the Iranian people. Our fight is against the murderous Islamic regime that oppresses and impoverishes you.\"",
      "He urged the people of Iran \"to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime,\" adding, \"This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard.\"",

      "\"I imagine the supreme leader is currently unable to sleep and worried about whether he'll be alive or not,\" Holly Dagres, a regional expert and senior fellow at the Washington Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Israel's ongoing strikes have killed several of Iran's top generals and security advisers to the ayatollah, dealing a blow to his inner circle, which, according to the Reuters news agency, consists of only 15 to 20 trusted loyalists. The dead include the commander-in-chief of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Hossein Salami, the chief of Iran's ballistic missile program Amir Ali Hajizadeh, and spy chief Mohammad Kazemi.",
      "On Tuesday, Israel's military boasted about killing the man tapped to replace the Iranian military's chief of staff, just four days after it killed his predecessor in its first round of strikes.",
      "\"We eliminated Ali Shadmani, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime,\" Israeli military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said Tuesday. \"He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation. He only managed to fill the position for 4 days.\"",
      "But even if Israel were to kill the ayatollah himself, Dagres said Iran's clerical regime has an established process in place to keep the government stable.",
      "Iran is not run by \"one man and some generals\"",
      "\"The thing with the Islamic Republic is this isn't just one man and some generals,\" Dagres told CBS News. \"This is a system or an apparatus that has been thought through very extensively. The Islamic Republic has something that's akin to the (Vatican's) College of Cardinals \u2014 the Assembly of Experts, and they actually determine who gets to be supreme leader.\"",
      "The top-level religious body, also known as Iran's Council of Experts, is composed of 88 senior Islamic clerics who are responsible for electing Iran's supreme leader, usually when the current one dies.",
      "\"From what we've been seeing so far, it doesn't sound like any of those people have been targeted\" by Israel, said Dagres. \"This is a replaceable regime in terms of leadership at the top, because they're prepared for the eventual death of a supreme leader.\"",
      "Even if Iran's entire theocratic system of government were to collapse, the upheaval would not necessarily guarantee a new government that is any friendlier to Iran's own repressed people, to Israel, or to the United States.",
      "\"There could be a scenario where the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps takes over, and they could go in different directions,\" said Dagres. \"They could be more authoritarian. They can be more Western-friendly. We don't know. I think one of the lessons of the Arab Spring, up until the fall of Assad, was that what happens isn't always better.\"",
      "Those Arab Spring pro-democracy uprisings across the Middle East in 2010 \u2014 in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Tunisia \u2014 were initially met with hope in the democratic Western world, but in most of those countries, the bids for democracy either devolved into civil war, or were beaten back by new or returning authoritarian regimes or the rise of extremist groups.",
      "Could internal tension threaten Iran's regime?",
      "Echoing Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned Iran's supreme leader on Tuesday he could suffer a fate similar to Iraq's former President Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi strongman's regime fell in 2003 after nearly a quarter century. He was found hiding in a bunker by U.S. forces and was then sentenced to death by a special Iraqi tribunal and hanged for crimes against humanity.",
      "\"I warn the Iranian dictator against continuing to commit war crimes and launch missiles toward Israeli civilians,\" Katz said on Tuesday. \"He should remember what happened to the dictator in the neighboring country to Iran who took the same path against Israel.\"",
      "Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat and commentator in Tel Aviv, told CBS News on Tuesday that the \"kinds of tensions that cause a regime to fall are usually internal, not external.\"",
      "\"A country of 10 million cannot precipitate a regime change in a country of 90 million,\" Pinkas noted, highlighting the vast discrepancy in size between Israel and the much larger Iran, which he noted was also 1,100 miles away.",
      "\"For that to happen, for a regime change to happen, you need basically a reenactment of the failed Iraq invasion [by the U.S.] of 2003,\" Pinkas said. \"And I don't think anyone wants that, certainly not the Americans.\"",
      "He views Netanyahu's call for Iranians to rise up against their own leadership as \"sheer arrogance.\"",
      "\"I doubt anyone living in Tehran and listening to Netanyahu would say, 'Oh, wow, you know, this is a call for action, I should get out and fight the regime because Mr. Netanyahu, a thousand miles away, told me to do so.'\"",
      "The last time mass anti-government street protests erupted in Iran was in 2022 with the so-called \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" movement. That outrage was sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran's religious police, reportedly after being detained for an improper head covering.",
      "Netanyahu has repeated the three-word protest refrain in messages aimed directly at Iranians since his country launched its attacks late last week.",
      "But those protests in Iran were quashed quickly \u2014 and aggressively \u2014 by Iranian authorities and had died down by the spring of 2023.",
      "Since Israel started bombing Iran last week, no one has taken to the streets in Iranian cities. The country's residents appear to be focusing on the immediate threat, scrambling for shelter and to evacuate major cities as Israeli bombs fall.",
      "\"Why would you be on the streets if Israeli jets are bombarding those very streets or bombarding military targets not far from you,\" noted Pinkas. \"They're driving away, as far away as possible from Tehran \u2026 but I think that when the dust settles \u2014 and that could be in two, three days, it could also be in three weeks, I honestly cannot predict that \u2014 I think a lot of that anger will be taken out on the regime.\"",
      "In other words, even if Israel's actions don't prompt an immediate toppling of Iran's Islamic rulers, it could fuel Iranians' determination to stand up to their clerical leaders. If that happens, it could come at one of the ayatollah's weakest moments in almost half a century.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 12:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump says he's not just \"looking for a ceasefire\" in the Israel-Iran war. He also warned all of Tehran's residents to evacuate.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said early Tuesday morning that he wants \"a real end\" to Iran's nuclear problem, with Tehran \"giving up entirely\" its enrichment activities. He said he was not just working toward a ceasefire to end the war between Iran and Israel, which has claimed at least two dozen lives in Israel and hundreds in Iran as it enters its fifth day.",
      "\"I didn't say I was looking for a ceasefire,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One after\u00a0cutting short his time at the G7 summit in Canada. \"We're looking for better than a ceasefire,\" he added.",
      "Hours later, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.\"",
      "He did not elaborate, but his statement came a day after Israel's military said it had taken full control of the airspace over Tehran.",
      "\"Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn't compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured 'stuff,'\" Mr. Trump said in his post Tuesday. \"Nobody does it better than the good ol' USA.\"",
      "Before Mr. Trump's post, administration officials had stressed that the U.S. was \"not involved in Israel's unilateral action against targets in Iran.\"",
      "The president also\u00a0said earlier\u00a0that French President Emmanuel Macron had \"mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a 'cease fire' between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump predicted that Israel would not slow its assault on Iran, which has largely decapitated the Islamic republic's military command and inflicted significant damage to its controversial nuclear program.",
      "\"You're going to find out over the next two days. You're going to find out. Nobody's slowed up so far,\" he said, hours after issuing an ominous warning that all of Tehran's roughly 10 million inhabitants should \"immediately evacuate.\"",
      "Asked about that warning on Air Force One early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted \"people to be safe,\" without offering any further explanation. Israel on Monday warned about 300,000 residents in a central district of Tehran to evacuate, pending attacks in the area.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested the reason he didn't want to stay in Canada was because he couldn't confidentially monitor developments in the Middle East. He said he could be \"more well versed\" in the White House Situation Room and avoid cellphones. \"I don't believe in telephones \u2014 because people like you listen to them,\" he told reporters on the plane. \"Being on the scene is much better.\"",
      "A source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News on Monday that Tehran had indicated to negotiators in Qatar and Oman that it was prepared to discuss a new deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but not while it was still under Israeli attack.",
      "The president said it was possible he could send special envoy Steve Witkoff or Vice President JD Vance, or both, to meet with Iranian negotiators, but \"it depends what happens when I get back\" to Washington.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Mr. Trump added. \"I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.\"",
      "Addressing any possible threat to U.S. interests in the region, Mr. Trump said Iran knew not to target U.S. forces, as the U.S. would \"come down so hard if they do anything to our people.\"",
      "The president declined to say whether Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Lt. Gen. Dan Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had provided him with options in the event Iran does attack U.S. bases in the Middle East.",
      "\"I can't tell you that,\" he said.",
      "Asked if it would take U.S. involvement to destroy Iran's nuclear program, Mr. Trump said he hoped it would be \"wiped out long before that.\"",
      "Vance says Trump has \"shown remarkable restraint\" but \"may decide he needs to take further action\"",
      "Vance weighed in on the Iran situation and Mr. Trump's response in a lengthy social media post Tuesday morning. Vance said the president has \"shown remarkable restraint\" in how he uses the U.S. military and that people are \"right to be worried about foreign entanglement,\" but argued the president has \"earned some trust on this issue.\"",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump \"may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,\" a decision that \"ultimately belongs to the president.\"",
      "\"And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish the American people's goals,\" Vance wrote. \"Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",
      "Trump says Iran was \"very close\" to obtaining a nuclear weapon",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has framed the attack he ordered on Iran late last week as an \"existential\" battle for Israel's survival. He claimed intelligence \u2014 which Israel has not shared publicly \u2014 showed the country was \"racing\" toward the development of a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu, along with all recent U.S. presidents including Mr. Trump, have always said they could not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "Just several months ago, however, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard delivered an assessment to lawmakers that said U.S. agencies continued \"to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.\"",
      "Gabbard said the U.S. was continuing to \"monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program,\" and she noted that \"in the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.\"",
      "Asked on Air Force One about that assessment from Gabbard, that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Israel expands assault on Iran",
      "Israel expanded its aerial assault on Iran Monday, hitting not only nuclear and military facilities and assassinating senior military leaders, but targeting the regime-controlled media. Iranian State TV's sprawling headquarters in Tehran came under attack as the network was broadcasting.",
      "CBS News' Seyed Bathaei in Tehran said the network remained on the air, but that one part of its compound was on fire Monday evening.",
      "Asked about the strike on Tuesday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said the network \"was used to spread anti-Israeli propaganda and called for genocide for several decades. We attacked it just as we attack all components of the Iranian terrorist regime and the plan to destroy Israel.\"",
      "In a clear show of domination over its long-time archrival, Israel also said Tuesday that it had killed the Iranian military's chief of staff Ali Shadmani, just four days after his predecessor was killed in Israel's first round of strikes.",
      "\"Following precise intelligence received by the Intelligence Branch, we eliminated Ali Shadamnai, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime. He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation.\"",
      "The attacks have sent thousands of Iranians racing to try to evacuate major cities. A massive explosion in the city of Isfahan was caught on someone's dashcam over the weekend as the passengers tried to flee.",
      "\"We can't leave. What else can we do,\" the car's anxious occupants can be heard saying.",
      "The human cost of the war is escalating on both sides. Iranian officials haven't provided an update since Sunday, when they said at least 220 people had been killed. They did not give a breakdown but said many civilians were among the casualties.",
      "In Israel, Netanyahu said Monday that at least 24 people had been killed by Iranian missiles that managed to evade the country's robust air defenses.",
      "The attacks continued Monday evening and into Tuesday morning, with Defrin saying Iran had launched 30 missiles, most of them intercepted, \"but several hits were identified.\"",
      "He did not report any new casualties, but warned Israelis: \"We must not be complacent, the Iranians still have intentions and the ability to strike.\"",
      "On Monday, an Iranian missile slammed into an apartment building in the central Israel city of Peta Tikva, killing four people.",
      "Israeli American Lihi Griner was there, with her husband and three children, hiding in their safe room.",
      "\"It was the biggest boom ever,\" she told CBS News. \"Even our safe room was shaking.\"",
      "When the family emerged, they found shattered glass strewn across their apartment.",
      "Given Mr. Trump's warnings and Netanyahu's stated determination to remove what he considers the multi-faceted threat posed by the Iranian regime, CBS News asked Griner if she was prepared for the war with Iran to get worse before it gets better.",
      "\"I'm not prepared,\" she said. \"I'm just gonna go and run in my little, you know, bomb shelter. I'm not prepared for everything. I wasn't prepared for this.\"",

      "Russia has in recent months stepped up its aerial attacks. It launched almost 500 drones at Ukraine on June 10 in the biggest overnight drone bombardment of the war. Russia also pounded Kyiv on April 24, killing at least 12 people in its deadliest assault on the capital in eight months.",
      "The intensified long-range strikes have coincided with a Russian summer offensive on eastern and northeastern sections of the roughly 620-mile front line, where Ukraine is short-handed and needs more military support from its Western partners.",

    "summary": "Residents in Barcelona, Spain, and several other popular European destinations say tourism in their cities is driving up housing costs for locals.",
    "story": [
      "Residents in Spain and several other popular destinations in Europe protested against mass tourism Sunday, saying a flood of summer visitors is driving up housing costs in their cities and pushing out locals.",
      "Some of the protesters in Barcelona and on the Spanish island of Mallorca sprayed tourists with water guns.",
      "The protests were part of the first coordinated effort by activists concerned with the ills of overtourism across southern Europe's top destinations. While several thousands rallied in Mallorca in the biggest gathering of the day, hundreds more gathered in other Spanish cities, as well as in Venice, Italy, and Portugal's capital, Lisbon.",
      "\"The squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\" Andreu Mart\u00ednez said in Barcelona with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \"Barcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\"",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 million people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 million visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaud\u00ed's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \"bubble tea\" spots.",
      "\"Our lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, are coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\"",
      "Around 5,000 people gathered in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, with some toting water guns as well and chanting \"Everywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\" The tourists who were targeted by water blasts laughed it off. The Balearic island is a favorite for British and German sun-seekers. Housing costs have skyrocketed as homes are diverted to the short-term rental market.",
      "Hundreds more marched in Granada, in southern Spain, and in the northern city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, as well as the island of Ibiza.",
      "In Venice, a couple of dozen protesters unfurled a banner calling for a halt to new hotel beds in the lagoon city in front of two recently completed structures, one in the popular tourist destination's historic center where activists say the last resident, an elderly woman, was kicked out last year.",
      "Protesters in Barcelona blew whistles and held up homemade signs saying \"One more tourist, one less resident.\" They stuck stickers saying \"Citizen Self-Defense,\" in Catalan, and \"Tourist Go Home,\" in English, with a drawing of a water gun on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protesters as he slammed the hostel's doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona's main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but Wanda said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit weather.",
      "\"That's lovely, thank you sweetheart,\" she said to the squirter. \"I am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\"",
      "There were also many marchers with water guns who didn't fire at bystanders and instead solely used them to spray themselves to keep cool.",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with mass tourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Spain, where protesters in Barcelona first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles in Spain, whose 48 million residents welcomed a record 94 million international visitors in 2024. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain's capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \"Get Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Spanish authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry while not hurting an industry that contributes 12% of gross domestic product.",
      "Last month, Spain's government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform that it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain's Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \"cannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\" which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "The boldest move was made by Barcelona's town hall, which stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing last year the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "That sentiment was back in force on Sunday, where people held up signs saying \"Your Airbnb was my home.\"",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\"I think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\" Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago, recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city, he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\"In the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\" he said.",
      "In another strategy, last year, Barcelona's leaders launched a program to replace outdated infrastructure in public schools to address rising temperatures, paid for by a tax on tourists.",
      "\"The possibility of using these revenues, the tourism tax, for such a project is very important so that we can accept tourism in our city and the role that tourism has,\" Barcelona's Deputy Mayor Laia Bonet told CBS News at the time.",
      "But some residents say the program misses the point.",
      "\"The government should be doing this without depending on tourism \u2026 it's public health,\" activist Agnes Rodriguez said. \"If you're coming to Barcelona tonight, to Chicago or to New York, and you're staying in a tourist apartment where a family should be living, you are part of this city changing. You're affecting the life of people living there.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/louvre-paris-closed-reopening-unclear/",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 10:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A spontaneous strike at the Louvre erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts.",
    "story": [
      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decadelong plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",

      "5. Use alias email addresses:\u00a0Create separate email addresses for things like online shopping, sign-ups, and banking.

These calls often come from spoofed or international numbers and may include\u00a0fake IRS agents,\u00a0tech support scams, or phony insurance offers. To fight back, enable your phone carrier's spam call protection (AT&T ActiveArmor, Verizon Call Filter, or T-Mobile Scam Shield). You can also use third-party apps like RoboKiller, Hiya, or Truecaller to screen calls, block known scam numbers, and report suspicious callers. Be sure to avoid answering unknown calls, even pressing a button to \"opt out\" can confirm your number is active and lead to more spam.

      "These enhancements are primarily rolling out to devices running Android 16. Some protections, such as enhanced theft protection and AI-powered scam detection, are also becoming available on select devices running Android 10 and later via Google Play Services updates.",
      "The most advanced features, including Identity Check and device-level Advanced Protection, are initially launching on Google Pixel and Samsung devices with One UI 7, with plans to expand to other manufacturers as they update to Android 16. Let's take a look at how these innovations are making Android security smarter and more comprehensive.",

      "Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1. Smarter protections against phone call scams",
      "Phone scammers are becoming increasingly creative, often attempting to trick people into changing device security settings or granting risky permissions during calls. Android's new\u00a0in-call protections add a layer of defense by blocking certain actions during calls with non-contacts. For example, you won't be able to disable Google Play Protect, sideload an app for the first time, or grant accessibility permissions while on a call with someone not in your contacts. If you're screen-sharing during a call, Android will prompt you to stop sharing when the call ends.",

      "Android's AI-powered\u00a0Scam Detection in Google Messages and Phone by Google is now even more intelligent. It can identify suspicious conversation patterns in real-time and warn you before you fall victim to a scam. This protection covers a wide range of scams, including toll road and billing fee scams, cryptocurrency scams, financial impersonation scams, gift card and prize scams, tech support scams, and more. All message analysis happens on your device, so your conversations stay private.",
      "Availability can vary depending on your device, region, and carrier. If you don't see these features yet, make sure your\u00a0app is updated and keep an eye out as Google continues to expand support to more users worldwide.",
      "Scam Detection (Google)",
      "3. Fighting fraud and impersonation with Key Verifier",
      "To help protect you from scammers who try to impersonate someone you know, Android is rolling out Key Verifier in Google Messages. This feature lets you and your contact verify each other's identity using public encryption keys, either by scanning a QR code or comparing numbers. If a contact's verification status changes, like after a SIM swap, you'll see a warning, giving you extra confidence that you're talking to the right person.",

Now, Find My Device is evolving into\u00a0Find Hub, making it easier to keep track of your devices, family, and friends all in one place, with more partner brands joining the network.",
      "Find Hub is also becoming more personalized. Whether you want built-in luggage tracking from\u00a0July and\u00a0Mokobara, ski protection with\u00a0Peak integration, or Disney-themed Bluetooth tags from Pixbee, there are options to suit different needs. Soon, tags that are enabled with ultra-wideband, starting with moto tag, will provide improved nearby location tracking.",
      "Later this year, Find Hub will include satellite connectivity, allowing you to stay connected with friends and family even when cellular service is unavailable. For travelers, new partnerships with airlines such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Iberia, and Singapore Airlines will let you share your Bluetooth tag's location directly with these airlines.

      "You can review and adjust related security settings within the Advanced Protection menu, such as app permissions and network controls, as new features become available. If you don't see the option, make sure your device is updated to Android 16 and check for any additional requirements, such as a Google account or specific device compatibility.

To do this, go to\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0System or\u00a0About phone, select\u00a0Software update or\u00a0System update, then tap\u00a0Download and Install if an update is available.",

      "Regularly review your privacy settings: Make sure you're comfortable with what you're sharing. Adjust settings to limit data sharing and enhance your privacy whenever possible.",

      "1) Always access the payment app from the official app or website, and not from any third-party platforms or services.",
      "2) Look at the security settings that the payment app offers and make sure they\u2019re all set to the highest and most protective settings.",
      "3) Consider using a personal data removal service to protect your privacy and reduce your risk of scams.\u00a0Scammers who target payment apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal often rely on information found on data broker and people-search sites to craft convincing impersonations or phishing attempts. These sites can list your name, address, phone number, and even connections to organizations you support, making it easier for fraudsters to trick you or others into sending money to fake accounts.",
      "Personal data removal services work by automatically removing your information from hundreds of data broker sites, making it much harder for scammers to find and misuse your details. By scrubbing your data from these sources, you lower your risk of being targeted in payment app scams and reduce the likelihood that someone could impersonate you or a nonprofit you care about.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",

      "5) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication, which means that you need to enter a code or use your fingerprint or face to unlock your account to prevent unauthorized access. This way, even if someone knows your password, they can\u2019t log in without your device or confirmation.",
      "6) Lock your device and log out of your apps. You should always lock your phone with a password, PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face. Never share your password, PIN, or security code with anyone. You should also log out of your mobile payment apps after each use and turn off the auto-login feature. This way, even if someone takes or borrows your device, they can\u2019t access your mobile payment apps without your approval.",
      "7) Verify the identity and legitimacy of the sender or receiver. You should always check the name, photo, username, and contact information of the person or organization you are sending money to or receiving money from before accepting or sending any payment requests. You should also confirm the reason and amount of the transaction before you agree to it. If you are not sure or have any doubts, you should contact the person or organization directly through another way, such as a phone call, text message, or email, but only if you know for sure that those forms of communication are legitimate. You should never send money or give your account details to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust, or anyone who asks you to do so out of the blue.",
      "8) Link your Venmo to a credit card as opposed to a debit card, so you can dispute a charge from scammers more easily. However, keep in mind, linking a credit card to your payment app can provide additional protection in the event of fraud, but this can come with extra costs in terms of transaction fees.",
      "9) Try not to keep a balance in your money-transferring apps.\u00a0You have a much better chance of being helped by your bank or credit card company when it comes to fraud than you do from a money-transferring app.",
      "10) Use strong antivirus software and never click on links from unknown sources,\u00a0especially when an email or text appears to have come from the payment App. Protect yourself from accidentally clicking on malicious links by running antivirus software on your device.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "11) Monitor your account activity and report any suspicious or unauthorized transactions.\u00a0You should set up notifications from your payment app and your bank via text or email, and check your account activity regularly. Look for any signs of fraud, such as payments you didn\u2019t make or receive, or changes to your account settings or information.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Unlike traditional banks, which are bound by federal consumer protection laws and fraud resolution timelines, peer-to-peer payment apps operate in a much looser regulatory environment. Services like Venmo often state in their user agreements that they are not responsible for mistaken or unauthorized payments unless there is clear evidence of account compromise or technical malfunction. Venmo\u2019s only suggestion here was to respond to a support ticket and wait. There was no emergency fraud hotline, no dedicated contact for nonprofits, and no indication that urgent action would be taken. Payment apps that allow donations to flow as quickly as a text message must also bear the responsibility of keeping those transactions safe. When a nonprofit has to beg for support just to protect its own identity, something is broken.",

      "Hugging Face, a well-known name in AI development, is making big moves in the world of robotics. The company has just introduced two open-source humanoid robots, HopeJR and Reachy Mini, designed to make advanced robotics more accessible to everyone, from researchers and developers to students and hobbyists.",

      "HopeJR is\u00a0Hugging Face's new full-size humanoid robot. It stands out for its impressive 66 actuated degrees of freedom. This means it can walk, move its arms, and perform a wide range of independent gestures, making it a versatile platform for research, experimentation, and even household tasks in the future. Imagine a robot that can help with chores or serve as a hands-on learning tool. HopeJR is designed to be just that.",
      "One of the biggest talking points is price. Hugging Face aims to keep HopeJR affordable, with an estimated cost of around $3,000. That is a fraction of what most full-scale humanoid robots cost, opening the door for smaller labs, schools, and dedicated enthusiasts to get involved in advanced robotics development.",

It can move its head, listen, speak, and interact with AI applications, making it a fun and practical tool for developers and educators alike.",
      "Reachy Mini is expected to cost between $250 and $300. It is designed to be a hands-on gateway into robotics, letting users build, customize, and experiment with embodied AI.

Hugging Face's CEO, Clem Delangue, emphasized that this approach helps keep robotics open and accessible rather than dominated by a handful of companies with proprietary black-box systems.

I thought it was Microsoft so I called the number. The guy was good. He gave me a name and employee number and we went through some things on my computer which brought up a screen that said 'scammers were listening' and my IP was being used on the Porn Hub. I thought, how could that be? But still, I was obtuse.",
      "\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.",
      "\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line.

      "Scammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.",
      "If you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.",
      "Protect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords",
      "Make sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password.\u00a0Consider using a\u00a0password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised.

      "Keep in mind that scammers are constantly evolving their tactics. You must always be on guard. Do not rely too heavily on technology to protect you, since there is a psychological aspect to their methods as well. Have a skeptical mindset and trust your instincts.

      "For context, the current V-Class starts at about $60,000 in Germany and can exceed $100,000 with options, so it's reasonable to expect the Vision V to command a significant premium, positioning it well above existing luxury van offerings. As with most high-end vehicles, the final price will likely depend on customization and selected features, but the Vision V is clearly aimed at buyers seeking exclusivity and the ultimate in automotive luxury.",

      "In the past decade, healthcare data has become one of the most sought-after targets in cybercrime. From insurers to clinics, every player in the ecosystem handles some form of sensitive information.",
      "However, breaches do not always originate from hospitals or health apps. Increasingly, patient data is managed by third-party vendors offering digital services such as scheduling, billing and marketing.",
      "One such breach at a digital marketing agency serving dental practices recently exposed approximately 2.7 million patient profiles and more than 8.8 million appointment records.",

      "Massive healthcare data leak exposes millions: What you need to know",
      "Cybernews researchers have discovered a misconfigured MongoDB database exposing 2.7 million patient profiles and 8.8 million appointment records. The database was publicly accessible online, unprotected by passwords or authentication protocols. Anyone with basic knowledge of database scanning tools could have accessed it.",
      "The exposed data included names, birthdates, addresses, emails, phone numbers, gender, chart IDs, language preferences and billing classifications. Appointment records also contained metadata such as timestamps and institutional identifiers.",
      "MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS",
      "Clues within the data structure point toward Gargle, a Utah-based company that builds websites and offers marketing tools for dental practices. While not a confirmed source, several internal references and system details suggest a strong connection. Gargle provides appointment scheduling, form submission and patient communication services. These functions require access to patient information, making the firm a likely link in the exposure.",
      "After the issue was reported, the database was secured. The duration of the exposure remains unknown, and there is no public evidence indicating whether the data was downloaded by malicious actors before being locked down.",

      "Medical identity theft allows attackers to impersonate patients and access services under a false identity. Victims often remain unaware until significant damage is done, ranging from incorrect medical records to unpaid bills in their names. The leak also opens the door to insurance fraud, with actors using institutional references and chart data to submit false claims.",
      "This type of breach raises questions about compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which mandates strong security protections for entities handling patient data. Although Gargle is not a healthcare provider, its access to patient-facing infrastructure could place it under the scope of that regulation as a business associate.",

      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If nothing else, this latest leak shows just how poorly patient data is being handled today. More and more, non-medical vendors are getting access to sensitive information without facing the same rules or oversight as hospitals and clinics. These third-party services are now a regular part of how patients book appointments, pay bills or fill out forms. But when something goes wrong, the fallout is just as serious. Even though the database was taken offline, the bigger problem hasn't gone away. Your data is only as safe as the least careful company that gets access to it.",

      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",

      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.",
      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains.

      "The good news is that you can take steps to reduce the risks and keep your address private. However, keep in mind that data brokers and people search sites can re-list your information after some time, so you might need to request data removal periodically.",
      "I recommend a few ways to\u00a0delete your private information, including your home address, from such websites.",
      "1. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0Data brokers can sell your home address and other personal data to multiple businesses and individuals, so the key is to act fast. If you\u2019re looking for an easier way to protect your privacy, a data removal service can do the heavy lifting for you, automatically requesting data removal from brokers and tracking compliance.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "2. Opt out manually : Use a free scanner provided by a data removal service to check which people search sites that list your address. Then, visit each of these websites and look for an opt-out procedure or form: keywords like \"opt out,\" \"delete my information,\" etc., point the way.",
      "Follow each site\u2019s opt-out process carefully, and confirm they\u2019ve removed all your personal info, otherwise, it may get relisted.",
      "3. Monitor your digital footprint:\u00a0I recommend regularly searching online for your name to see if your location is publicly available. If only your social media profile pops up, there\u2019s no need to worry. However, people finder sites tend to relist your private information, including your home address, after some time.",
      "4. Limit sharing your address online:\u00a0Be careful about sharing your home address on social media, online forms and apps. Review privacy settings regularly, and only provide your address when absolutely necessary. Also, adjust your phone settings so that apps don\u2019t track your location.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your home address is more vulnerable than you think. People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks. Taking proactive steps to protect your home address is essential. Do it manually or use a data removal tool for an easier process. By understanding how your location is collected and taking measures to remove your address from online sites, you can reclaim control over your personal data.",

      "AI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations.

      "Your email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.",
      "My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is\u00a0to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

The malware turns home electronics into participants in a global network of cybercrime, often before the user even powers them on.",
      "In a statement, the FBI says BadBox 2.0 is commonly found on cheap Android-based devices manufactured in mainland China.

The original botnet was briefly disrupted in Germany in 2024 when security researchers \"sinkholed\" the malware's command servers. That wiped out part of the operation, but not for long. Just a week later, the malware reappeared on nearly 200,000 devices, including more recognizable brands like Hisense smartphones and Yandex TVs.",

      "1. You bought a low-cost Android-based device from an unknown or no-name brand:\u00a0Devices sold online through third-party sellers or unknown brands, especially if advertised as \"unlocked,\" \"jailbroken\" or offering free streaming, are at higher risk. Models like the T95 box or other generic Android TV boxes are known carriers. Specifically, the following devices have been identified as impacted by BadBox malware:",

      "2. Only buy certified and trusted devices:\u00a0Stick to devices certified by Google or other recognized platforms. Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",

      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "A group of foreign policy and security experts have compiled a report looking at a solution for a \"day after\" plan in Gaza, and believe private security contractors, which have heavy experience in the Mideast could be a solution to replace Hamas.",
      "The question of a \"day after\" plan in the Gaza Strip has plagued negotiations between Israel, the U.S., Arab nations and Hamas for months and has ultimately led to the terrorist network\u2019s refusal to release the 55 hostages still held there.",

      "\"We needed a solution on humanitarian aid,\" Hannah said. \"And when we looked around the world, who could do this, take over the humanitarian aid? We were left with one option.\"",

      "PSCs have a storied history in the Middle East, and not only the U.S. war on terror. They have been used by nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which could lend them a level of acceptance that would not be attainable by another force.",

      "\"It's not at all foreign to these Arab parties that you might employ PSCs for certain critical missions,\" Hannah said. \"Our idea was, let's scale it up. Let's unify the effort. Let's have America and the Arabs lead it.",
      "\"The Arabs would put in most of the humanitarian aid workers, a lot of the financing, and then they would hire some of these international PSCs with a lot of experience to come in and protect those operations,\" he explained. \"You'd have the Arabs engaged, which we thought was absolutely critical.\"",
      "The plan also included bringing in other international aid organizations that would work with these PSCs to expand developments like housing projects, community development and infrastructure repair to restore electricity and water.",
      "\"And eventually, hopefully, begin to identify new leadership, local leadership in Gaza, who would be prepared to cooperate with the operations of this nonprofit entity,\" Hannah said. \"Local Gazans of goodwill, who wanted to be rid of Hamas, who this entity could provide some support to, some protection to so they can, could begin rebuilding Gaza civil administration.\"",

      "Israel\u2019s preemptive attack on Iran not only marked a major milestone for the 77-year-old nation, but also a turning point for the Middle East. According to a former IDF spokesperson, as Jerusalem grapples with the ongoing war in Gaza, it\u2019s clear Israel has its eyes set on one major goal: ensuring that Tehran never obtains a nuclear weapon.",

      "In the early hours of Friday morning local time, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes and covert operations to take out Iranian infrastructure and senior leadership.

      "\"To be frank, a nuclear program like that means it's personnel before it is infrastructure. And if we're serious about it \u2014 to have a meaningful lasting impact on the Iranian nuclear weapons program means that Israel has to work quite long and quite hard and it means a lot of knowledge has to be deleted,\" Conricus said.",

      "\"So, I think that with the benefit of hindsight, Iranian strategic planners, when they were thinking about this multi-front assault on Israel from Gaza, from Lebanon, from Syria, maybe from other places, and they had these pipe dreams that that would somehow eradicate the State of Israel \u2014 with the benefits of hindsight \u2014 may not have been such a brilliant idea.\"",

Following Israel\u2019s attacks, several countries, including France and the U.K., reaffirmed their opposition to Tehran gaining a nuclear weapon, even while criticizing Jerusalem for its operation.",
      "\"Many countries behind the scenes are very positive and cheering on Israel and even sending messages of support and wishing us the best of luck against the Iranians because it would suit their strategic goals, and they're happy that someone is standing up to the regional bully, which is Iran,\" Conricus said.",

      "However, he noted that those countries still have an opportunity to assert themselves.",
      "Conricus also believes that while \"it\u2019s too early in the game\" to predict what this could mean for Iran domestically, there is a chance that the Iranian regime could be at stake. The country was already dealing with internal unrest prior to Israel\u2019s attack as the population revolted against the regime\u2019s quashing of basic rights and freedoms.",

      "With his country having killed some of Iran\u2019s top military commanders and rattled its leadership, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his government\u2019s aerial assault on Iran could trigger the collapse of the regime, opening the door to a popular uprising.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to predict, but it could be the result of our mighty action,\u201d Netanyahu told reporters. \u201cWe are changing the face of the Middle East.\u201d",
      "That scenario, according to scholars who study Iran, as well as former U.S. and Israeli officials, is unlikely. The theocratic government remains deeply unpopular, but it still has a tight grip on power, and no organized opposition is poised to seize authority, they say. And if there is change at the top, it might come not from a popular uprising but from a coup within the regime, which might produce an even more authoritarian result.",
      "Still, the Iranian government is struggling to cope with the attacks. Some experts say that even if Israel\u2019s onslaught does not topple the regime, it could inflict permanent damage, leaving it in a weakened state that could embolden opposition activists or fuel internal power struggles inside the theocratic system.",
      "After having initially targeted nuclear and missile sites at the start of its air campaign last week, Israel has expanded its target list to include oil facilities, police headquarters and the state television center \u2014 all representing crucial elements of the government\u2019s political and economic power.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going after the apparatus of repression inside the regime,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank that has called for imposing tougher sanctions and other measures against Iran.",
      "If they weaken the security services used to crush dissent in Iran, the strikes could open up more space for opponents of the regime, Dubowitz said.",
      "\u201cI think their hope is we can undermine and distract the security forces and have Iranians take to the streets, as they\u2019ve been for many years now, and take back their country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the key pillars of the Israeli strategy.\u201d",
      "Wary of foreign interference",
      "But Israeli missiles may not be the ideal vehicle for overturning Iran\u2019s authoritarian rule, experts said.",
      "Hamidreza Azizi, a former professor at Iran\u2019s Shahid Beheshti University who is now a visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said that several days into the conflict, \u201cwe still see no sign of a popular uprising against the government.\u201d",
      "On the contrary, Azizi said, \u201cimages of devastation in civilian areas and the deaths of innocent people are making Iranians \u2014 who are inherently patriotic and emotionally connected to their nation \u2014 quite uneasy about Israel\u2019s ultimate intentions.\u201d",
      "Suzanne Maloney, who has written about Iran\u2019s politics and advised previous U.S. administrations, said the Iranian people\u2019s dissatisfaction with the regime is also coupled with deep national pride and a wariness of foreign interference.",
      "\u201cIranians are very well understood to resent their government. They\u2019re deeply critical of its failures, both in terms of how it has governed the country and how it has represented their interests on the world stage,\u201d said Maloney, a vice president at the Brookings Institution think tank. \u201cBut they also are fiercely nationalistic.\u201d",
      "Given Iran\u2019s bitter experience with foreign meddling, distrust of outside powers is pervasive, and it is a \u201cthird rail\u201d in Iranian politics since a U.S.-British coup toppled a democratically elected prime minister in 1953, she said.",
      "Since it came to power in the 1979 revolution that toppled the country\u2019s pro-Western monarch, the Islamic Republic has a long record of repression, using its security services to crush protests and imprison dissidents.",
      "The government is also struggling to contain rising discontent over the ailing economy, which has been plagued by rampant inflation and financial misery for millions of Iranians, according to regional analysts and Western diplomats. Officials in Tehran have blamed U.S. sanctions for the economic troubles.",
      "Every few years, popular anger erupts in the streets. Most recently, demonstrators vented their outrage after the killing of Mahsa Amini, who died in a hospital in 2022 after the country\u2019s morality police arrested her for not adhering to the country\u2019s dress code, which requires women to conceal their hair and the shapes of their bodies.",
      "Iranian opponents of the regime have had mixed reactions to the Israeli strikes.",
      "Reza Pahlavi, the eldest son of the deposed shah, who ruled Iran for four decades until he was forced out by mass street protests in 1979, said that the regime in Tehran was \u201cat its weakest point\u201d and that Iranians now had an opportunity to secure democratic rule. \u201cNow is our moment,\u201d he said on X.",
      "Several prominent Iranian activists and filmmakers, including Nobel laureates Shirin Ebadi and Narges Mohammadi, wrote an op-ed calling for an immediate end to the fighting and demanded that the Iranian government halt uranium enrichment work.",
      "The group also denounced attacks on civilians by both Iran and Israel and called for a transition to democracy in Iran.",
      "\u201cDeeply committed to Iran\u2019s territorial integrity and the inalienable right of its people to self-determination under genuine sovereignty, we believe that continuing uranium enrichment and the devastating war between the Islamic Republic and the Israeli regime neither serves the Iranian people nor humanity at large,\u201d it said.",
      "It added: \u201cIran and its people should not be sacrificed for uranium enrichment and the ambitions of the Islamic Republic.\u201d",
      "Imprisoned reformist Mostafa Tajzadeh \u2014 an ardent critic of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \u2014 has condemned Israel\u2019s barrage, arguing it did not offer a legitimate way to oust the regime.",
      "\u201cI know that some sections of the people are happy with these attacks, because they see them as the only way to change the failed clerical government,\u201d Tajzadeh said in a letter from prison, according to Gooya, a Persian-language news website based in Belgium. \u201cBut even if the war leads to such an outcome, Iran will be left in ruins, where most likely statelessness and chaos will prevail.\u201d",
      "Tajzadeh, who was deputy interior minister more than 20 years ago and has favored a rapprochement with the West, called Israel\u2019s strikes \u201cthe aggression of a foreign army, on the orders of someone who has been accused of war crimes\u201d \u2014 referring to Netanyahu \u2014 which, \u201cin my opinion, lacks political and moral justification and has no precedent in post-constitutional Iran.\u201d",
      "So far, there have been no signs of major defections from the country\u2019s political leadership, and most Iranians are focused on trying to seek safety amid daily bombing raids from Israel, said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\u201cI think people are under aerial bombardment, and they\u2019re just thinking about staying alive and staying safe, staying secure. They\u2019re not thinking about waging political protests,\u201d he told MSNBC.",
      "Although an overwhelming majority of Iranians reject the government\u2019s rule, there is no opposition in waiting, and the regime remains heavily armed and organized, Sadjadpour said. \u201cAt the moment, they probably are calculating \u2018kill or be killed,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have their fingers on the trigger right now.\u201d",
      "Regime change",
      "Unlike their Israeli counterparts, President Donald Trump and his top aides have not encouraged the Iranian people to rise up or invoked the idea of ousting the regime. During his first term, Trump\u2019s deputies expressed solidarity with the Iranian people and privately argued that economic sanctions could cause the regime to unravel.",
      "But Trump and his current Cabinet are outspoken critics of previous U.S. attempts at \u201cregime change\u201d in Iraq and elsewhere, and some of Trump\u2019s supporters worry the United States could be drawn into another military intervention in the Middle East.",
      "Daniel Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank who was U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Biden administration, said Israel should stick to a more realistic goal of disabling Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs and steer clear of trying to shape Iran\u2019s internal politics.",
      "\u201cThere are certainly plausible scenarios where this becomes a regime-threatening event, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s imminent, and I don\u2019t think it should be the goal of the military campaign,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "An attempt to change the regime would be a \u201cmassive undertaking\u201d that would depend on factors beyond the control of any outside power, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a recipe for overreach and for getting drawn into a lengthy and potentially fruitless kind of military engagement. The memory is very heavy of what happened to us in Iraq,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "An elite coup?",
      "The Israeli assault has exposed widespread vulnerabilities in Iran\u2019s security and military establishment, which could fuel power struggles and possible defections, experts said.",
      "\u201cThe Tehran regime is unlikely to be toppled by a popular uprising, but it is possible that Iran witnesses an elite coup,\u201d said Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at the London think tank Chatham House.",
      "Israel\u2019s extensive infiltration of Iran\u2019s military and government, illustrated by its ability to assassinate top military commanders, shows that Israel most likely has a degree of support among elements of the Iranian regime, Khatib said.",
      "Even though those Iranians might not support Israel itself, they \u201cshare with Israel the objective of regime change,\u201d she said.",
      "Israel\u2019s bid to topple the Iranian government carries serious risks, including producing an even harder-line regime dominated by members of the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps, experts said.",
      "\u201cGiven the history of this regime, given what the Iranian people have suffered, I think it\u2019s a wrongheaded and ineffective strategy and one that it may, in fact, backfire on Israel,\u201d Maloney of Brookings said.",
      "\u201cBe careful what you wish for. An Iran that is racked by violence and chaos is not going to be a better neighbor,\u201d she added."

    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s unprecedented shake-up of a key federal vaccine advisory panel ushered in appointees who have expressed skepticism about the value and safety of vaccines \u2014 raising concerns about the group\u2019s objectivity.",
      "The eight new members Kennedy appointed to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about who should get certain vaccines, include three people who have testified as expert witnesses against vaccine makers, NBC News found in a review of the members\u2019 professional backgrounds.",
      "One of the new members has published articles questioning the safety of Covid vaccines and received thousands of dollars from a libertarian think tank that opposed pandemic-era restrictions. A few have promoted misinformation about vaccines and public health.",
      "The group\u2019s first meeting, scheduled for June 25-27, is set to include votes on recommendations for Covid, HPV, influenza, meningococcal and RSV vaccines.",
      "Kennedy billed his firing of the entire 17-member panel as a way to restore public trust in vaccines and eliminate conflicts of interest, but three health policy experts said his new slate brings fewer qualifications and more anti-vaccine views compared with the previous one.",
      "\u201cThis is an attempt to replace one of the most powerful and important vaccine advisory groups in perhaps the world with folks who are anti-vaccine,\u201d said Matt Motta, an assistant professor of health law and policy at Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health.",
      "Motta said he is concerned that the group, as it stands, would choose not to recommend future lifesaving mRNA vaccines even if the data supported it. Most of the members, he said, \u201care folks who may have scientific credentials, but they are at the fringes of their field.\u201d",
      "As founder of the country\u2019s largest anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, Kennedy's skeptical views about vaccines are well-documented. As health and human services secretary, he has downplayed the importance of the measles vaccine amid a major outbreak, instead touting unproven treatments like cod liver oil and an inhaled steroid. Under his leadership, the CDC also stopped recommending Covid vaccines for healthy children, and the Food and Drug Administration has said it will limit the approval of updated Covid shots to older adults and younger people with underlying medical conditions.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that the new panel \u201cincludes highly credentialed scientists, leading public-health experts, and some of America\u2019s most accomplished physicians. All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense.\u201d",
      "While the group includes some doctors, epidemiologists and medical researchers, an NBC News review found many lack specific expertise in vaccine science or policy.",
      "\u201cI see way more conflict with Kennedy and with the new appointees than I do anything even remotely close with the old group,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, head of the medical ethics division at NYU Langone Medical Center.",
      "Several new members have been outspoken critics of vaccines for years. During the pandemic, physician and scientist Robert Malone, who was involved in some early research into mRNA technology, spread false allegations of widespread dangers and deaths from the Covid vaccines, leading Twitter to suspend his account. Most recently, Malone published misinformation about the Texas measles outbreak, suggesting that measles-mumps-rubella vaccines, which the federal government has approved for decades, might be to blame and saying the vaccines carry \u201csimilar risks as the wild measles virus,\u201d which is untrue.",
      "Malone\u2019s advocacy has led to speaking engagements, a Substack newsletter with more than 350,000 followers \u2014 some paying $6 a month \u2014 and a private consulting business that charges $500 for 15-minute \u201chealth and wellness\u201d consultations.",
      "He has also been an expert witness in multiple vaccine-related lawsuits, including a case in which he testified that Merck misrepresented trial data and lacked evidence that its mumps vaccines provided protection. A judge found in favor of Merck, and the opinion was upheld on appeal. In addition, Malone testified in challenges by service members fighting Covid vaccination requirements, in which he said all the available Covid vaccines were \u201cexperimental medical products\u201d and therefore not FDA-approved. Both of those cases were dismissed after the Defense Department rescinded its vaccination mandate. Court filings show he charged $350 an hour in one case.",
      "\u201cI have no bias against Merck,\u201d Malone said by email, referring additional questions to HHS.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said Malone\u2019s \u201crole as an expert witness in these cases reflects the appropriate application of his scientific expertise in legal and regulatory settings: an entirely standard practice for subject matter experts in modern medicine. Similarly, his work in the biotech industry, published writings, and consulting engagements reflect both professional credibility and a commitment to public dialogue.\u201d",
      "Another new appointee to ACIP, Vicky Pebsworth, has worked for anti-vaccine groups for about 20 years. Pebsworth, a registered nurse with a doctorate in public health and nursing from the University of Michigan, is a board member and the volunteer director of research and public safety for the National Vaccine Information Center, which researchers consider a leading source of misinformation about vaccines. She has been a consumer representative on several federal vaccine panels and working groups.",
      "In bios and conference speeches, Pebsworth says her activism was sparked by her only child\u2019s autism diagnosis, which she attributes to vaccines he received at his 15-month well-baby visit. She became a prominent voice for the debunked claim that thimerosal \u2014 a preservative removed from childhood vaccines in 2001 \u2014 triggers conditions like autism.",
      "She also was an expert witness in a failed federal lawsuit brought by activists who sought to outlaw childhood vaccination mandates, claiming they prevented meaningful safety comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated children \u2014 a view espoused by Kennedy. A judge dismissed the case in 2021 for lack of standing.",
      "In a public comment letter to the FDA in May, Pebsworth wrote that regulators \u201cshould not make vaccine use recommendations for anyone\u201d about Covid shots. She did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Dr. Walter Orenstein, who directed the CDC\u2019s National Immunization Program from 1988 to 2004, reviewed the list of the eight appointees and said he is aware of only one \u2014 Dr. Cody Meissner, a Dartmouth University professor of pediatrics and a previous ACIP member \u2014 who has relevant expertise.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not aware of qualifications for any of the other people that would normally be used in selecting\u201d ACIP members, said Orenstein, who is now a professor emeritus of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine. The committee typically looks for people with backgrounds in vaccine research or policy, he said, who publish frequently in respected scientific journals. Many of those experts should be physicians who see patients and are familiar with the infectious diseases that vaccines are designed to prevent, he added.",
      "Historically, ACIP membership follows a yearslong vetting process in which nominees are screened for conflicts of interest. Experts who are employed by vaccine manufacturers, own significant stock in vaccine companies or hold patents on vaccine products or vaccine-related technology generally cannot serve on the committee, per ACIP policy. To become members, experts must also agree to give up any advisory or consulting roles for vaccine manufacturers, except for roles in clinical trials or on data monitoring boards.",
      "Once appointed, members file annual financial reports with the Office of Government Ethics and must disclose any vaccine-related activities before every meeting. When conflicts do arise \u2014 which happens, given that vaccine expertise often comes with professional ties to manufacturers \u2014 CDC waivers may allow members to join discussions while barring them from voting on the matters.",
      "Past members have received grants from manufacturers for trials or had previous work experience with pharmaceutical companies. Out of 17 voting members last year, only two declared conflicts that prevented them from voting at a meeting, according to the CDC\u2019s website.",
      "Contrary to Kennedy\u2019s claim that the previous ACIP members were not properly vetted for conflicts, \u201cthere are many steps and many safeguards, and they\u2019re serious about it,\u201d Caplan said. \u201cSome people have complained over the years who were turned down that the screening for conflict of interest is too strict. No one has ever said it\u2019s not strict enough.\u201d",
      "It is unclear what vetting process went into selecting the eight replacements for ACIP, though Nixon told NBC News last week that the review was thorough.",
      "Another ACIP appointee, Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician, is one of three co-authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, a widely criticized memo that decried pandemic-era lockdowns and advocated for letting people at minimal risk of dying get exposed to Covid. Kulldorff, who did not respond to requests for comment, says he was fired from Harvard for refusing to get a Covid vaccination. He is senior scientific director at the Brownstone Institute, a libertarian think tank that paid him $108,333 in 2022 and publishes his articles criticizing public health measures.",
      "In a deposition last year, Kulldorff estimated that he earned $49,000 as a $400-an-hour expert for plaintiffs who claimed Merck\u2019s Gardasil vaccine, which protects against HPV, caused injuries. In a written report, Kulldorff criticized what he said were flaws in the company\u2019s safety analyses. The lawsuit was dismissed in favor of Merck, which denied the claims.",
      "The new ACIP member with the strongest industry connections is Dr. Michael Ross, an obstetrician-gynecologist, who earns a living on the investment side of health care. Ross is listed on the company website as an operating partner at Havencrest Capital Management, a Dallas private-equity fund that has raised roughly $600 million and has invested in clinical trials of vaccines and autism services.",
      "Ross\u2019 LinkedIn account lists board or advisory seats at a half-dozen biotech startups and a previous role as CEO of the contact lens maker Euclid Systems Corp. During the pandemic, he co-signed an open letter criticizing a study that found no benefit from ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug that became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among Covid deniers despite a lack of evidence of its efficacy. Ross declined requests for comment.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s other ACIP picks do not have the same clear industry or advocacy ties.",
      "MIT operations management professor Retsef Levi posted a viral video in 2023 that urged an \u201cimmediate suspension\u201d of mRNA shots and co-authored two papers linking Covid vaccines to negative health effects and \u201csignificantly higher risk\u201d of death, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary; one was not peer-reviewed, and the other had multiple corrections. Meissner, the Dartmouth professor, signed the Great Barrington Declaration and has questioned Covid vaccinations for healthy children. Retired California emergency physician James Pagano does not have any published vaccine research and has shared incendiary views online about Islam. And Dr. Joseph Hibbeln is a longtime nutrition scientist and seafood industry adviser without apparent vaccine expertise.",
      "Hibbeln said by email that he has \u201cno conflicts of interest of any kind\u201d and has \u201creceived no funds or anything else that may be considered a conflict of interest.\u201d Levi referred NBC News\u2019 inquiry to HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard, who said that his \u201cexpertise in decision science, risk-benefit tradeoffs, and data integrity is highly relevant to the work of ACIP\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to reduce his qualifications ignores the breadth and substance of his contributions to public health and safety.\u201d Meissner and Pagano did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Health policy experts said they are hopeful the new ACIP members will disclose their conflicts before meetings and recuse themselves from voting when appropriate. But they shared reservations about whether the standard ACIP policies will be enforced under Kennedy\u2019s leadership, given his own anti-vaccine sentiments and decision to fire qualified ACIP members.",
      "\u201cUltimately, the person who\u2019s going to hold those individuals accountable for reporting conflicts of interest is Secretary Kennedy,\u201d said Motta of Boston University."

      "Charles Dalzell, a 46-year-old from St. Thomas, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and charged with interstate threats and threats against a federal officials. It\u2019s not immediately clear if he\u2019s retained an attorney.",

In that case, the shooting suspect had first opened fire upon state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette Hoffman, and went to the homes of other state politicians.",
      "The Sunday email indicated that Dalzell was allegedly owed money after a court victory. According to the complaint, he claimed he raised concerns regarding his legal case to federally elected public officials but was ignored, and police \"were attempting to silence him so public officials could engage in corruption",
      "The complaint said Dalzell indicated two officers told him the public officials were not interested in helping him, and he was close to going to jail.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Right-wing media personality Tucker Carlson clashed with Sen. Ted Cruz in an interview and posted a clip Tuesday night in which the senator was unable to answer questions about Iran.",
      "\"How many people live in Iran, by the way?\" Carlson asked the Texas Republican.",
      "\"I don't know the population,\" Cruz responded.",
      "\"At all?\" Carlson asked, prompting Cruz to reiterate that he did not know. \"You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?\"",
      "Asked again how he did not know Iran's population, the senator responded, \"I don't sit around memorizing population tables.\" (The CIA estimated in 2024 that the country's population level sits at around 88 million.)",
      "The clip immediately caught fire online, with Carlson's post racking up more than 22 million views and thousands of comments, according to X analytics.",
      "The clash underscores a broader split within the MAGA movement over U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. One faction of the movement, including Carlson, has urged against U.S. intervention, painting the other side as \"warmongers.\" The more hawkish faction, which includes Cruz, has forcefully supported the United States backing Israel's efforts.",
      "The conflict comes as President Donald Trump weighs what he will do next, with a senior administration official telling NBC News on Wednesday morning that \"all options remain on the table.\" Asked about potential U.S. strikes against Iran, Trump told reporters Wednesday, \"I may do it, I may not do it.\"",
      "Cruz said in a Fox News interview on Sunday that he believed \u201cit is very much in the interest of America to see regime change\u201d in Iran.",
      "Also included in the clip of Carlson's interview, which airs in full on Wednesday, the former Fox News host argued that Cruz's knowledge about Iran's population was \"kind of relevant because you're calling for the overthrow of the government.\"",
      "Moments later, Carlson asked Cruz for the ethnic mix of Iran.",
      "\"They are Persians and predominantly Shia,\" Cruz said, referring to a sect of Islam.",
      "Carlson cut in to ask for percentages and Cruz retorted, \"this is cute\" as the two men talked over each other. (Persians make up Iran's largest ethnic group, but the country also has Azeri, Kurd, Lur and other groups, according to the CIA.)",
      "\"You don't know anything about Iran,\" Carlson said, and the interview devolved into a heated, overlapping exchange.",
      "After the clip was published, Cruz accused Carlson on X of releasing \"a snippet playing a 'gotcha' on the population of Iran.\"",
      "\"I declined to play that silly game,\" he continued, encouraging people to watch the full interview when it airs.",
      "Trump has weighed in on Carlson's criticism of potential U.S. strikes on Iran, calling the former Fox News host \"kooky.\"",
      "\"Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,\u201d IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday before the interview clip was posted on  X.",
      "Asked by a reporter Monday for his response to Carlson calling Trump \"complicit\" in the conflict with Iran, Trump said, \"I don\u2019t know what Tucker Carlson is saying. Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\" Carlson left Fox News in 2023."

    "story": [
      "Attorneys of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil and the Trump administration clashed in court over Khalil\u2019s renewed request to be released on bail or, at least, transferred to a detention center in New Jersey to be closer to family.",
      "Both parties submitted new filings after U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz declined to release Khalil last week. While Farbiarz had blocked Khalil\u2019s detention and deportation based on allegations that his presence in the country threatened U.S. foreign policy, the administration argued that it would continue to detain Khalil for allegedly lying on his permanent residency application.",
      "Judge Farbiarz previously said it was \"overwhelmingly likely\" that Khalil wouldn\u2019t be detained solely over allegations related to his residency application. The judge, however, ultimately sided with the government, finding that Khalil's legal team hadn\u2019t successfully argued why detention on those grounds would be unlawful.",
      "Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and former Columbia University student, was arrested in March by immigration agents and has been held since then at a facility in rural Jena, Louisiana. He played an active role in the protests over the war in Gaza on the New York City campus last year, negotiating between the student protesters and the university administration.",
      "His attorneys urged the court this week to immediately release him from a Louisiana detention center on bail, adding that the administration\u2019s efforts to keep him detained based on alleged omissions in an immigration application were \"rare and extremely unusual.\"",
      "The allegations, which were brought after Khalil\u2019s arrest, included claims that he failed to disclose continued employment at the British Embassy in Beirut and a prior role as an officer at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in New York.",
      "NBC News found that the administration had relied on unverified tabloid articles and made erroneous claims about Khalil's work history and affiliations after reviewing over 100 pages of evidence submitted by the government.",
      "Khalil has no criminal record and has not been charged with a crime.",
      "In court filings, Khalil's lawyers said his custody \"amounts to further unconstitutional retaliation and adds to the extraordinary circumstances warranting relief.\"",
      "\"Like it has for the past three months, the government is using all of the tools available to it to hinder justice for Mahmoud,\" said Brett Max Kaufman, senior counsel at the ACLU. \"The government practically never holds people in detention on a charge like this, and it\u2019s clear that the government is doing anything they can to punish Mahmoud for his speech about Palestine.\"",
      "If not released, Khalil\u2019s attorneys asked for him to be transferred to a detention center in New Jersey, pointing to a policy that requires noncitizen parents or legal guardians, who are primary caretakers or have custody of minor children, to be placed in facilities close to their children.",
      "According to emails reviewed by NBC News, Khalil\u2019s legal team asked\ufeff ICE to transfer him to New \ufeffJersey earlier this month so that he could be closer to his newborn son. However, the New Orleans ICE Field Office said Khalil did not meet the policy\u2019s criteria and denied the request without explanation.",
      "On Tuesday, the Trump administration pushed back in court filings, arguing that green card application allegations \"independently\" justified Khalil\u2019s detention.",
      "In court documents, the Justice Department said the federal judge \"should not order Khalil\u2019s outright release, because doing so would impede the Government\u2019s discretionary decision to detain him on lawful independent grounds. Congress barred judicial intervention over those decisions.\"",
      "The Trump administration said the Department of Homeland Security, not the courts, also has the authority to determine where individuals in deportation proceedings are held.",
      "In response to Khalil's attorneys citing agency policy for his transfer, the Trump administration said, \"They are policies or guidelines, not regulations.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyers added that the detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, is over capacity and ordering a transfer \"would undoubtedly affect the facility\u2019s continued efforts to fall back within operational norms.\"",
      "The Department of Justice declined to comment, and the Departments of Homeland Security and ICE did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Tennessee law restricting gender transition care for minors, delivering a major blow to transgender rights.",
      "The 6-3 ruling is likely to have a broad impact as 24 other states have already enacted laws similar to the one in Tennessee, which bars gender transition surgery, puberty blockers and hormone therapy for youth.",
      "Those laws now look set to survive similar legal challenges. The ruling does not affect states that do not have such bans, meaning care in those states will still be available.",
      "The court was divided on ideological lines, with the six conservatives in the majority and the three liberals in dissent.",
      "Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts concluded that the Tennessee law does not constitute a form of sex discrimination that would violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "\"This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,\" Roberts wrote. \"The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound.\"",
      "\"The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion that contrary to the majority's conclusion, the law does discriminate based on both sex and transgender status and should therefore be analyzed closely.",
      "\"By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims,\" she wrote. \"In sadness, I dissent.\"",
      "Sotomayor also took the relatively unusual step of reading a summary of her decision from the bench in court, saying the impact of the decision is \"incredibly dangerous.\"",
      "Trans rights activists have warned that a ruling allowing bans on care for trans minors could pave the way for similar restrictions aimed at adults.",
      "\"Today's ruling is a devastating loss for transgender people, our families, and everyone who cares about the Constitution,\" Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the challengers, said in a statement.",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti welcomed the decision as a win for \"common sense over judicial activism.\"",
      "He added that legislators should give \"careful scrutiny\" before allowing such treatments, making judgments \"based on science, not ideology.\"",
      "The legal challenge was brought by the administration of former President Joe Biden, as well as transgender teens and their families.",
      "The ruling does not resolve all legal issues relating to the state bans, as it did not address a separate argument under the 14th Amendment that the laws violate the right of parents to make health care decisions for their children.",
      "The court also did not rule on the question of whether laws that discriminate against transgender people are subject to what is called \"heightened scrutiny,\" meaning that judges should review them with a skeptical eye. But three of the conservative justices said transgender people are not a \"suspect class,\" meaning laws targeting them should not receive heightened scrutiny.",
      "Other issues involving transgender rights, such as laws blocking transgender girls from participating in sports, are likely to reach the court in due course.",
      "Upon taking office in January, President Donald Trump has set about unwinding Biden policies that sought to bolster transgender rights. Among other things, he signed an executive order seeking to restrict gender-affirming care for teenagers nationwide. A judge quickly blocked it.",
      "Trump has also imposed new restrictions on transgender people serving in the military.",
      "Enacted in 2023, the Tennessee law is among a wave of similar measures taken by states imposing restrictions on gender transition treatments. In defending its ban, the state's lawyers pointed to similar measures taken in other countries, including in Europe.",
      "Skrmetti emphasized in court papers the evolving debate over how best to treat minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the clinical term given to the distress people can experience when their gender identities are in conflict with the genders assigned to them at birth.",
      "Major medical organizations say gender-affirming treatments are an effective way to treat gender dysphoria.",
      "The challengers argued that the law is a form of sex discrimination that violates the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause because the treatments at issue in the case \u2014 puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u2014 can be used in other situations.",
      "The case marks the most significant ruling on transgender rights since the court in 2020, to the surprise of many, ruled that federal employment protections extend to gender identity, as well as sexual orientation.",
      "The dispute reached the Supreme Court after the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2023 rejected challenges to the Tennessee law and a similar measure in Kentucky.",
      "A district court judge had blocked parts of the law, while concluding that the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to challenge the surgery ban. That provision of the law was not at issue before the Supreme Court."

      "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The Indiana Pacers are preparing for the possibility of not having Tyrese Haliburton available to play in Game 6 of the NBA Finals, coach Rick Carlisle said in a radio interview on Wednesday morning.",
      "Haliburton has been dealing with a lower right leg injury throughout the series and it worsened during Monday's Game 5 loss. Haliburton played through it for most of his 34 minutes, but failed to make a field goal in the game and Indiana lost to Oklahoma City 120-109 \u2014 falling behind 3-2 in the title series.",
      "Now facing a win-or-else scenario, there is a chance Haliburton does not play in Game 6 on Thursday.",
      "\"He is going to be carefully evaluated over the next 36 hours and will likely be listed as questionable on the injury report and probably will be a game-time decision for Game 6,\" Carlisle said on Indianapolis radio station 107.5 The Fan.",
      "Haliburton, part of the team that won Olympic gold in Paris for USA Basketball last year, was undergoing evaluation Tuesday to determine the extent of the injury.",
      "After Game 5, Carlisle did not specifically say that the MRI would be part of the team's next moves in figuring out how best to proceed with Haliburton, though made clear that the Eastern Conference champions would be taking a close look at the injury. Given that it is evidently a muscular injury, an MRI is part of the typical evaluation process.",
      "\"We have to prepare for two scenarios \u2014 one where he plays and one where he does not,\" Carlisle said in the radio interview.",
      "If Haliburton cannot play, it would seem likely that the Pacers would promote guard TJ McConnell to a starting role. McConnell has been brilliant throughout these playoffs and sparked a rally where Indiana closed an 18-point deficit to a two-point difference in the second half of Game 5, before Oklahoma City pulled away again and for good.",
      "\"Depending on the situation tomorrow, we may need him for significantly more minutes,\" Carlisle said of McConnell.",
      "Haliburton left Game 5 late in the first quarter and returned to the bench area with a wrap on his lower leg. He not only returned to the game, he played 34 minutes \u2014 but did so while missing all six of his shots and with him barely looking to shoot at all in the second half. He finished the game with seven rebounds and six assists, but only four points.",
      "It was the first time in Haliburton's career that he logged at least 34 minutes and failed to make a single field goal.",
      "The Pacers, Carlisle said, discussed not letting Haliburton play in the second half. Haliburton vetoed those plans and played 17 minutes in the second half, leading the Pacers in rebounds and assists after intermission.",
      "\"I mean, it's the NBA Finals. It's the finals, man,\" Haliburton said after Game 5. \"I've worked my whole life to be here and I want to be out there to compete. Help my teammates any way I can. I was not great tonight by any means, but it's not really a thought of mine to not play here. If I can walk, then I want to play. They understand that. And it is what it is. Got to be ready to go for Game 6.\"",
      "The Pacers are scheduled to practice Wednesday. It will largely be a meeting and walk-through session, Carlisle said."

      "The court ruled 6-3 on technical grounds that the state of Texas and others that sued could not pursue their claims because they had failed to intervene at an earlier stage when the agency was considering the proposal.",
      "As a result, the justices did not reach the legal question of whether the NRC could authorize a temporary, privately owned storage site and allow for waste to be transported there.",
      "At issue was whether the commission correctly allowed a company called Interim Storage Partners\u00a0to store spent nuclear fuel in Andrews County, Texas, for up to 40 years.",
      "As was discussed during the oral argument in March, the site could effectively become permanent, as the agency could extend the 40-year deadline indefinitely.",
      "The United States has no permanent storage facility in large part because a long-gestating plan to construct one at Yucca Mountain in Nevada was never completed amid political opposition.",
      "The decision could affect a similar proposal for a site across the border in New Mexico, which the commission also approved.",
      "The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the commission for its 2021 decision, leading the Biden administration to take the case to the Supreme Court. The Trump administration took over the case and defended the commission\u2019s authority to approve private nuclear waste storage sites.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and others, including major landowner Fasken Land and Minerals, challenged the commission's decision in court. The appeals court ruled both that they had a right to file suit and that the agency did not have the authority to issue the license.",

      "The United States government will activate an extra 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles, the military confirmed in a statement Tuesday night, as a legal battle continues over the deployment.",
      "Protests against federal immigration policies that exploded in Los Angeles and across the country in recent weeks have since died down, and a nighttime curfew has been lifted as businesses return to normality.",
      "Nevertheless, the U.S. Northern Command said the reinforcements were needed to  \"support the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property in the greater Los Angeles area.\"",
      "The 2,000 troops are deployed at the direction of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, using Title 10, which allows the president to call in the National Guard when the country is at risk of invasion or rebellion.",
      "That means at least 4,100 National Guard troops and 700 Marines have been deployed to the streets of L.A. after 2,100 were sent there on June 9. Tuesday's statement confirms a statement from last Monday on the troop increase.",
      "The soldiers cannot participate in civilian policing, leading city leaders to attack the deployments as political theater.",
      "\"The soldiers are completing training on de-escalation, crowd control, and use of the standing rules for the use of force in advance of joining the federal protection mission,\" the military statement said.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom condemned the move and said the troops would be \"twiddling their thumbs.\"",
      "\"This isn\u2019t a new deployment \u2014 it\u2019s the same group of soldiers who have been diverted from critical wildfire work and work at the border, now twiddling their thumbs for Donald Trump\u2019s political theater,\" Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson from Newsom\u2019s office, said.",
      "Newsom said last week that the deployment of an extra 2,000 personnel would be \"reckless, pointless and disrespectful to our troops.\"",
      "L.A. Mayor Karen Bass has called the deployment a \"chaotic escalation.\"",
      "The confirmation of the extra personnel came hours after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on whether the federal government can deploy troops to American cities, or should turn over their command to Californian officials.",
      "The court heard an appeal and ruled last week that President Donald Trump can retain command of the troops, pausing a ruling from District Court Judge Charles Breyer that said the deployment was unlawful.",
      "Tuesday's hearing considered whether the most recent order can stand as the case proceeds through the courts. The three-judge panel seemed unlikely to be interested in lifting the pause that was imposed by the Appeals Court.",
      "That court is expected to make a decision in the coming days, ahead of a Friday hearing before Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco federal court.",
      "The Appeals Court\u2019s decision \u2014 and any potential Supreme Court involvement \u2014 could have huge ramifications for the political executive's powers and activities in Washington and whether troops can be sent to other cities."

      "Experts say the attacks on Iran are unlikely to lead to a regime change. The Federal Reserve will decide whether to change interest rates or keep them the same. And pop star Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s new album cover sparks scrutiny and debate.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know today.",
      "Israeli assault could fuel power struggles in the Iranian regime",
      "President Donald Trump is considering options including a possible U.S. strike on Iran, multiple current and former administration officials said after he met yesterday with his national security team in the White House Situation Room to discuss the conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump also called on Iran to surrender unconditionally and appeared to show solidarity with Israel in posts on social media/ \u201cWe now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,\u201d one read, referring to the U.S. and Israel.",
      "This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.",
      "Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country\u2019s assault could trigger the collapse of the Iranian regime and open the door to a popular uprising. But scholars who study Iran, as well as former U.S. and Israeli officials, say that scenario is unlikely.",
      "There are a few factors:",
      "\u2192 First, Iranian opponents of the regime have mixed reactions to the Israeli strikes. Given the country's bitter experience with foreign meddling, distrust of outside powers is pervasive. Several days into the conflict, \"we still see no sign of a popular uprising against the government,\" one expert said. Another noted, \"Iranians are very well understood to resent their government... but they are also fiercely nationalistic.\"",
      "\u2192 While a popular uprising is unlikely, \u201cit is possible that Iran witnesses an elite coup,\u201d an associate fellow at the London think tank Chatham House said. The Israeli assault has exposed widespread vulnerabilities in Iran\u2019s security and military establishment, which could fuel power struggles and possible defections. A coup from within the regime might produce an even more authoritarian result, experts said.",
      "Regardless, the Iranian government is struggling to cope with the attacks. Even if Israel\u2019s onslaught does not topple the regime, it could inflict permanent damage.",

      "The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting today as it continues to assess the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs and focus on clamping down on inflation. If so, the announcement likely won\u2019t sit well with Trump, who has called for lower rates and asserted there is no inflation. But retail spending is down, and the president\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs rollout has left businesses and consumers in limbo.",
      "The Fed is also keeping an eye on ongoing signs that the job market is slowing down. Last week, filings for unemployment insurance climbed to just short of 2 million, the most since November 2021, and hiring rates remain at lows not seen in more than a decade. Read the full story here.",

The Department of Homeland Security said they arrested Lander for \u201cassaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.\u201d But Lander said after his release that he did not assault law enforcement and criticized the Trump administration. \u201cWe are not going to let Donald Trump wreck the rule of law, to deny people due process, and to turn our country into something that doesn\u2019t meet its obligation under international law,\u201d he said.",

      "Artificial intelligence chat tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Google\u2019s Gemini and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot have achieved significant public adoption, according to the latest NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey. Nearly three-quarters of adults \u2014 74% \u2014 say they\u2019ve used one of the tools at some point. And 44% say they use them \u201csometimes\u201d or \u201coften.\u201d",
      "Despite rising acceptance, the future ubiquity of artificial intelligence tools like those put out by OpenAI and Google remains an open question. Polling data suggests that current adoption rates of AI chat tools look similar to internet adoption rates at the turn of the century. But the trajectory of AI\u2019s growth and the challenges it faces are unique.",

      "In the recent survey, 47% said they believe a school that prohibits using AI would better prepare students for the future. That sentiment extends even to the most frequent AI chat tool users \u2014 one-fifth of those who say they use AI tools \u201coften\u201d say prohibiting them in the classroom would better prepare students.",

      "The split views on AI use and AI\u2019s impact on the future come as elected officials in Washington have largely left AI companies untouched, introducing few regulations that constrain them.",
      "President Donald Trump has undone many of the initial attempts at regulation and oversight put in place by then-President Joe Biden, and many Republicans have embraced the Trump administration\u2019s anti-regulation stance on AI. But in the background, college professors and teachers across the U.S. have expressed exasperation at the potential influence that increasing student use of AI could have on young minds, and many progressives have balked at AI\u2019s potential influence on the job market and the environment, with many urging others to abandon the use of AI altogether.",
      "Slightly less than half \u2014 44% \u2014 of U.S. adults surveyed said that they used AI tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini or Microsoft Copilot \u201csometimes\u201d or \u201cvery often,\u201d while 56% said they used these tools \u201crarely\u201d or \u201cnever.\u201d",

      "The divide comes as educators grapple with the encroachment of increasingly accessible technologies capable of helping students research, study or cheat more efficiently. While some teachers have swung back toward handwritten essays and in-class work in efforts to prevent AI use, others have embraced AI by intentionally integrating it into assignments.",
      "Last year, OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT Edu, a version of its flagship chatbot made specifically for use on college campuses. Google\u2019s Gemini and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot are also among the major AI models that have introduced tools for education.

      "In 2023, Apple TV+ released the first season of the romantic historical fiction drama, based on the Edith Wharton novel of the same name. The series follows Nan St. George (Kristine Froseth) and her gregarious group of friends as they leave behind the new money of New York City and venture into the stiff London society across the pond.",
      "Season 1 ended with Nan marrying Theo, the Duke of Tintagel (Guy Remmers), even after it was revealed that she is illegitimate and born from one of her father's affairs.",
      "In the finale's last scene, Colonel St. George, Nan's father, told his wife and the woman who raised Nan, Patti (Christina Hendricks), that Nan's birth mother was at the wedding.",
      "The Season 2 premiere, which hit the streaming platform June 18, picked up right where things left off, with Hendricks' character storming through the crowd before she encounters Nan's birth mother: a woman named Nell, played by Meester.",
      "\"Nice hat,\" Nell tells Patti as they are reunited for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "Over the course of the Season 2 premiere, viewers learn that not only is Nell Nan's birth mother, she's also Patti's younger sister.",
      "It is revealed that after Patti had older daughter Jinny (Imogen Waterhouse), Nell moved in with the St. Georges. While living with the family, Nell had an affair with Colonel St. George, resulting in a pregnancy. After Nan's birth, Nell absconded, and she didn't lay eyes on her daughter again until her wedding day.",
      "When Nan interrupts the two sisters, Patti simply introduces her sibling as \"Aunt Nell,\" keeping her identity as Nan's mother a secret.",
      "Meester tells TODAY.com in an interview that one of the questions she had to grapple with was why her character would choose to attend the wedding.",
      "\"(Nell) probably, in my mind, stayed away as much as possible, but always had her ear pricked to what was going on in Nan\u2019s life, even before she was going to marry a duke,\" she says.",
      "So why now?",
      "\"I think that once it came out that Nan was illegitimate \u2014 the word that they were using \u2014\u00a0a little valve was released of the shame and the pain of all those years, of holding it in and thinking that it was the absolute worst thing, this mark on her, her family and Nan. And that it could potentially threaten Nan's future,\" Meester explains.",
      "But as the events of Season 1 showed, Nan's secret being exposed didn't have the impact she feared.",
      "Nan's heritage was revealed behind her back, but she later publicly owned it. Theo also stood up for her, strengthening their relationship in the lead up to their eventual marriage.",
      "\"(Nan) was able to freely open up about this information. I think that it freed Nell to some extent to go,\" Meester says.",
      "In the premiere, Nell's arrival certainly makes for a dramatic entrance, the \"Gossip Girl\" actor adds. But for Meester, her character's goal was simple.",
      "\"She knew where (Nan) was going to be at one moment, one place in time. I think she maybe didn't think, 'I will go tell Nan.' But (she went) at least to have some kind of contact, because to be away for so long from your own family is devastating,\" Meester says.",
      "As for what her character has been up to for the past 19 years, Meester says she was \"focused on forging ahead.\"",
      "\"I also think that she did, in my mind, spend many years punishing herself. And, I would put this in quotes, but 'behaving badly,'\" Meester adds. \"Because I think that's what she thought she deserved and what was expected of her.\"",
      "\"So she wasn't living a, quote, unquote good life,\" she continues. \"I think she was probably treating herself and others poorly during those years because she felt she was not good enough.\"",
      "Episode 1 ends with Nell offering Nan advice as her daughter suffers immediate regret for marrying Theo due to her lingering feelings for Guy (Matthew Broome). Then after a heart-to-heart with Patti, where Nell reminds her older sister that she was younger than Nan is now when she got pregnant, the sisters return to New York together.",
      "To Meester, Nell represents someone who survived the pain of not only giving up her child, but also the turmoil of living with that choice and keeping it a secret.",
      "\"I think you get the chance now to say that was the correct choice and the braver choice,\" Meester says. \"And that still remains today, when people have to make a decision like that. It is almost always the more sound choice if they've thought it out, which usually people have.\"",
      "Meester meticulously crafting her character's backstory is one of the many reasons co-stars Kristine Froseth and Christina Hendricks praised her addition to the cast.",
      "\"We love her,\" Hendricks tells TODAY.com. \"I was really, really excited about the casting when I found out about it. I had never met her before, but I was a fan, and so (I) didn't know what to expect.\"",
      "Hendricks notes that Meester was also tasked with joining a large ensemble cast that had already developed chemistry.",
      "\"It's always strange to come in as a newcomer when a show is already established and on its way, but she just fit right in,\" she says.",
      "\"(Meester) came in with lots of great ideas and great questions and just seamlessly fit in immediately,\" she adds.",
      "Froseth reveals it was \"nerve-wracking\" after Meester's casting was announced and she learned she would portray her birth mother. The 29-year-old actor is a huge \"Gossip Girl\" fan, but Froseth's nerves quickly settled once she met Meester.",
      "\"She's so down to earth, and so down to talk about character, and immediately wanted to do that,\" Froseth recalls. \"We didn't have much time beforehand to prep, but right away we started texting.\"",
      "She says they created a group chat so they could all be on the same page by the time filming began. For Froseth, the communication established a \"support system\" she could lean on.",
      "\"I'm really glad we had each other, because those dynamics are so nuanced and things move so fast in the show. I think it was important for me, at least, to get to talk to you guys about how you were feeling,\" she says, while gesturing to Hendricks.",
      "The \"Mad Men\" alum agrees, adding that with only eight episodes, there isn't as much time to explain the history between their characters. So, the three of them worked together to ensure audiences could sense the strained and complicated relationship.",
      "\"'What would have happened the last time they (saw) each other? What has transpired in that amount of time? Who lived where?' were some of the questions they discussed,\" Hendricks shares. \"Just technical things that the audience may not see right away, but will definitely enrich the performance and (were) important for us to have the relationships we wanted.\""

When former Islander Yulissa tries to kiss Jeremiah during the game, he deflects and opts for a kiss on the cheek instead \u2014 signaling quite early he has eyes for just Huda. By Episode 3, they are laughing about being the \u201cmom and dad\u201d of the villa.",

      "\u201cI was not expecting Jeremiah and Olandria to, like, actually kiss,\u201d Huda says in her confessional. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see that going on.\u201d",
      "When she confronts Jeremiah about it, he doubles down on his actions and responds coolly, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d",
      "The situation escalates when other Islanders begin side-eyeing Huda\u2019s reaction to the kiss. Nic asks Jeremiah if Huda\u2019s protective behavior is \u201cover the top,\u201d wondering if that level of reaction would be an issue for him in a \u201creal relationship.\u201d",
      "Jeremiah shrugs off the comments, responding simply, \u201cI mean I can\u2019t control what she do.\u201d",
      "But the real shock comes when host Ariana Madix sweeps through the villa to lead a re-coupling. In a \u201cLove Island USA\u201d first, America had voted on pairings for the new bombshells \u2014 Pepe, Iris and Jalen \u2014 and those left single would be at risk. In the most surprising twist, viewers choose to pair Jeremiah with Iris, effectively separating him from Huda.",
      "The re-coupling leaves Huda single and vulnerable. When the remaining coupled Islanders have to vote someone out of the villa, Huda receives two votes \u2014 from Nic and Ace, two of Jeremiah\u2019s close pals \u2014 but was ultimately saved when another Islander, Charlie, is eliminated instead.",

      "The fallout from Episode 12 \u2014 from America choosing to separate Huda and Jeremiah, from Nic and Ace voting to eliminate Huda, and from Jeremiah\u2019s massive shrug at all of it \u2014 was immediate and explosive in Episode 13. Jeremiah doesn\u2019t speak to Huda for the rest of the evening after the re-coupling, later saying he was \u201cchecked out.\u201d",
      "Nic and Ace get in front of Jeremiah, though. Their conversation escalates quickly, with Nic suggesting Huda had been marking Jeremiah with hickeys so other women wouldn\u2019t engage.",
      "\u201cBoth of you are just closed off, it\u2019s been tunnel vision since day one,\u201d Nic says.",

      "Meanwhile, Huda is spinning about the viewers\u2019 choice to separate her and Jeremiah. Does America not like her, or is America seeing something about Jeremiah that she isn\u2019t? She appears to believe the latter: She rages to the girls that Jeremiah didn\u2019t check on her after the re-coupling and rages some more about it from the shower, which Jeremiah overhears.",
      "If those seeds of doubt weren\u2019t planted by the guys before, that shower moment might\u2019ve done it for Jeremiah. When Jeremiah and Iris are sent on a date, along with the other re-coupled Islanders, he says he is open to new connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited to hit the reset button with you,\u201d he tells her. \u201cAmerica put us together for one reason or another.\u201d",

      "The breaking point comes when Huda overhears Jeremiah debriefing the rest of the boys on his date with Iris. \u201cHuda\u2019s cooked, I\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d Jeremiah says. He reveals that he\u2019d heard Huda in the shower the night before calling him a \u201cb----\u201d and \u201cliar.\u201d",
      "\u201cTruthfully now in hindsight, I would have rather Huda have gone home, just because of the way she reacted,\u201d Jeremiah tells the guys.",
      "Huda emerges from behind a wall where she\u2019d been eavesdropping and confronts Jeremiah directly: \u201cBy all means, explore,\u201d she says, flipping him off.",
      "The episode ends with a private conversation, where Jeremiah apologizes to Huda for not being there when she was almost eliminated, but Huda isn\u2019t having it.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the reason why everything happened. You\u2019re the reason why I reacted the way I reacted,\u201d she tells him. \u201cI don\u2019t want s--- to do with you.\u201d",
      "What Happened in Episode 14?",
      "The June 17 episode picks up where Episode 13 ends, during that conversation with Huda and Jeremiah. Huda tells him that the Islanders and the viewers believe he has done \u201csubtle things\u201d that have shown his true colors, but Jeremiah replies that she has it flipped.",
      "\u201cWe have such different vibes and expectations, it seems,\u201d Jeremiah says in a confessional.",
      "Nevertheless, Jeremiah tries to make amends with Huda the next morning. During a private chat, he tells her that he\u2019d like to start over as friends. Huda\u2019s not interested in that, though. She storms away, yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me!\u201d",
      "The rest of the Islanders are watching all of this from various parts of the villa, and, as Nic says, they\u2019re drained.",
      "Fast forward to the end of the episode, when Ariana Madix shows up once again for a surprise re-coupling. This time, it involves a game where each of the women stand behind a locked door. Only the guy they want to couple with can open that door, though. Any guy who\u2019s met with a locked door and any girl who remains behind a door is left single and vulnerable.",
      "Jeremiah is the last guy to choose a door \u2014 and it\u2019s between Iris\u2019s and Huda\u2019s. He chooses Iris.",
      "That move now leaves Huda vulnerable once again, along with one other Islander, Jalen. And because \u201cLove Island\u201d never stops there, the rest of the Islanders are then tasked with voting one of the two singles out of the villa.",
      "While Huda ends up safe, receiving eight backers versus Jalen\u2019s four, the vote gave viewers a clear view of the Islanders\u2019 thoughts on this saga. Jeremiah is among the four who vote to keep Jalen and dump Huda. And another shocker? Ace backs Huda instead of Jalen \u2014 but maybe not for reasons Huda thought. When Huda reaches her hand out to thank Ace, he leans away. \u201cHell, no,\u201d he whispers.",
      "So the saga continues."

    "summary": "Barbara Walters' relationship with her daughter, Jacqueline Guber, is highlighted in a new documentary \"Barbara Walters Tell Me Everything.\"",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Walters was best known for her career as a pioneering journalist who spent many years with TODAY and ABC News. But much less well known is the tumultuous story of her private life, particularly with her lone child, Jacqueline, whom she adopted in 1968.",
      "In the new ABC News Studios documentary \u201cBarbara Walters Tell Me Everything,\u201d which features archival footage of Walters, who died in 2022, she calls her daughter \u201ca blessing\u201d that came about after three miscarriages. She adds that having a daughter was \u201cthe best thing\u201d she ever did.",
      "But others took a different cue from the challenges Walters and Jackie faced over the years, especially when paired with a demanding, international career.",
      "\u201cShe had a charged, complex relationship with her daughter,\u201d says Oprah Winfrey in the doc, adding that witnessing how parenthood played out for Walters partially influenced her decision not to have children at all.",
      "In recent years, Jacqueline Guber, now in her late 50s, has kept her private life private, but there\u2019s much to know about her younger years and her relationship with her mother.",
      "Jacqueline was named for Barbara\u2019s sister",
      "Walters adopted Jacqueline with her second husband, theater producer Lee Guber. When Jacqueline was born, the couple kept her adoption a secret, making no press announcement, NBC News reported in 2002.",
      "\u201cIn part because I really didn\u2019t want the biological mother to know that Jackie had been adopted by us,\u201d Walters said. \u201cI just kept right on working.\u201d",
      "The adoption specifics were a bit unique, though. Walters told Winfrey in a 2014 interview, \u201cWe had dinner one night with a couple we rarely saw. The woman said that she had a little girl who was blonde and blue-eyed, and they wanted to adopt a boy. ... They didn\u2019t want the girl. And we said, \u2018We\u2019ll take the girl!\u2019\u201d",
      "She told Winfrey she named her after her older sister.",
      "In the documentary, Walters reflects on some of the challenges her sister faced.",
      "\u201cToday, they would talk about it as a disability,\u201d she says, \u201cand it may even be that my sister was autistic and we didn't know it.\u201d",
      "Walters also elaborated on the name significance in her 2014 retirement special, \u201cBarbara Walters: Her Story,\u201d according to People.",
      "\u201cI knew that my sister was never going to be married and have a child, and I wanted her to have part of the joy that I had.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline helped her mother accept \u2018Baba Wawa\u2019",
      "At the height of her fame, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member Gilda Radner did an impression of Walters on the show known as \u201cBaba Wawa,\u201d honing in on how the journalist pronounced her \u201cr\u201d letters.",
      "Walters didn\u2019t like being made fun of until her daughter told her to \u201clighten up.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hated the Gilda Radner \u2018Baba Wawa\u2019 until I walked into my daughter\u2019s room one night,\u201d Walters said during a 2009 interview with the Television Academy Foundation. \u201cShe was up watching it ... I said, \u2018What are you doing up?\u2019 and she said, \u2018I\u2019m watching Baba Wawa.\u2019\u201d",
      "When Walters explained she didn\u2019t like the impression, Jacqueline said, \u201cLighten up.\u201d And in the interview, Walters said, \u201cI did.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline was a runaway as a teenager",
      "After her divorce in the 1970s, it was virtually impossible for Walters as an ambitious single woman to also be a full-time mother. As former TODAY co-anchor Katie Couric says in the new documentary, being a working mother was seen as \u201can oxymoron\u201d back then.",
      "Jacqueline was not left alone, journalist Cynthia McFadden, who was adopted herself, notes in the film.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to say Jackie had a father, and Jackie had a governess,\u201d McFadden says.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how tough it was because she had a mother who was a celebrity,\u201d says Walters of her daughter in the doc.",
      "Walters explains Jacqueline struggled with schools and began taking pills. At 16, she ran away.",
      "\u201cI loved to run,\u201d Jacqueline told NBC in 2002. \u201cI thought running would solve all my problems.\u201d",
      "When Walters learned where her daughter was, she had a former Green Beret pick her up and sent her to an intervention program in Idaho for three years.",
      "\u201cEven though she, you know, probably kicked and screamed, she knew that things were getting so desperate, she had to go,\u201d Walters said in 2002. \u201cBut to send a child away is heartbreaking \u2026 I just knew that for this child, who was struggling enough to be her own person and not be Barbara Walter\u2019s daughter, to have this be headlines. I could have lived with it, OK. You know? But it would have been terrible for her.\u201d",
      "The program saved her life, Jacqueline said in 2002.",
      "She ran a wilderness camp for troubled teens",
      "After getting her diploma and completing the program, Jacqueline\u2019s father, Lee Guber, died. She was just 18, and moved to Oregon to find some anonymity, according to NBC News.",
      "She later moved to Maine where she met a licensed wilderness guide named Mark Danforth, and the two married.",
      "In 2001, she started a wilderness camp for troubled teens, New Horizons for Young Women, which was open from 1999 to 2008. The camp closed during the recession after financial challenges, as she outlined in a letter at the time.",
      "Jacqueline remains private today",
      "These days, Jacqueline is living a life out of the headlines and spotlights. But in 2001, at Walters\u2019 request, McFadden sat down to interview Jacqueline for a special about adoption called \u201cBorn in My Heart: A Love Story.\u201d",
      "As clips in the new documentary show, when McFadden asks what is tougher on Jacqueline, being adopted or being the child of a famous parent, the answer comes easily: being the child of a famous parent.",
      "\u201cHands-down,\u201d says Jacqueline.",
      "\u201cI could be the bum down there on the street corner\u2019s child. \u2026 And here I am, today, made up, dressed up and it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s almost like I was pasted into this world. And yet ... I am so regular,\u201d she adds.",
      "She also apologizes for making her mother\u2019s life hard when she was younger.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said, 'I\u2019m sorry,' for so many things. \u2026 I was sorry for my whole teenage years,\u201d she says.",
      "As Couric notes late in the documentary, it seems that Walters\u2019 relationship with her daughter ultimately came in second place to her career.",
      "\u201cI felt like she neglected her personal life and poured so much into her work life, that I\u2019m not sure she was a truly happy person,\u201d Couric says.",
      "\u201cI always got the sense that Barbara wishes she had paid more attention to that.\u201d",
      "\u201cBarbara Walters Tell Me Everything\u201d begins streaming June 23 on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+."

    "story": [
      "Brad Pitt may be an Oscar-winning actor, but he says he\u2019ll never quite own his own stunts like Tom Cruise does.",
      "Pitt, who plays a veteran race car driver in the new film \u201cF1 The Movie,\u201d really did rev up the engines while behind the wheel for the part.",
      "\u201cOur first scene was on the grid during race weekend at Silverstone (home of British Grand Prix events), where F1 started, and we were on the grid with the drivers,\u201d he told TODAY\u2019s Savannah Guthrie at a June 16 New York City screening of the film in an interview that aired June 17. \u201cWe got one take, and we\u2019re moving on. And it just led to this great kind of energy you'll see that I think shows on the screen.\u201d",
      "Savannah pointed out that Cruise is known for his own stunts in movies, prompting her to ask Pitt if he\u2019s now been inspired to do the same.",
      "\u201cNot a chance. Tom has cornered the market, and none of us are going to get close to him,\u201d he said.",
      "Pitt is in awe of what it\u2019s like driving these cars.",
      "\u201cIt is such a thrill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to explain what these cars can do. We would be barreling down the straight at 180, and you think that\u2019s something. But the fact that these cars can brake, can stop and make a complete right turn. It feels like the car is going to flip, and it sticks. It is unbelievable. It\u2019s unbelievable what these drivers can do.\u201d",
      "Pitt may have been driving, but he said it wasn\u2019t necessarily his idea.",
      "\u201cJoseph Kosinski, our director, had this audacious idea that he\u2019s going to take real actors, put them in real cars, on real tracks, and embed us in the pinnacle of the sport, the F1 racing season,\u201d he said.",
      "Co-star Damson Idris, who plays a young driver mentored by Pitt\u2019s character, heaped praise on the \u201cFight Club\u201d star for his driving skills, too, especially compared to his own deficiencies.",
      "\u201cBrad was great at it because he rides bikes. I came out like a slow snail every time, and I\u2019d always stall it and hold up the whole grand prix,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, yeah, we trained for, like, four months over two years. And after you watch the movie, you\u2019re going to see us for real trying not to die!\u201d",
      "Idris can\u2019t help but marvel at how he got the opportunity to star alongside Pitt, especially because he once crossed paths with the Pitt before Idris himself hit the big time.",
      "\u201cI used to be an usher at the Lyceum Theatre in London, for \u2018The Lion King\u2019 musical. And that day I\u2019m working in the back, and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018Brad Pitt\u2019s here,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI snuck out, and he was going through the door. He had his long, blond hair, blue jeans and these tan boots, and he\u2019s just walking out. And I said to myself, \u2018One day I\u2019m going to work with him.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cSo I\u2019ve stalked him my entire career,\u201d he added.",

      "Carell received an honorary degree of Doctor of Arts from Northwestern. While he did not go to Northwestern himself, he touched on learning improv from the school's summer high school theater program.",
      "\u201cI was a \u2018Cherub\u2019 in the Northwestern Summer High School Institute for Theatre, and it was there that I was first introduced to improvisation, when several Northwestern students gave us a master class. That inspired me to later move to Chicago and to pursue a career at The Second City,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAn improv scene goes nowhere unless everyone listens to one another. The best way to see and understand another human being is to listen to them. To listen is to show respect.\u201d",
      "He also has ties to Northwestern because of his children. His daughter Annie is a member of the class of 2023, while son Johnny is class of 2026."

    "story": [
      "What message is the cover art for Sabrina Carpenter's upcoming album, \"Man's Best Friend,\" sending, both artistically and for her brand?",
      "The singer's fans have been asking themselves just that since the art was released June 11, sparking conversation and controversy.",
      "Carpenter even replied to a person who questioned her personality and cover art choices.",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is the first follow-up to Carpenter's 2024 album \"Short 'n' Sweet\" that launched her to new heights of fame with songs like \"Espresso\" and \"Please Please Please.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the cover art for \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "What is the cover art for 'Man's Best Friend'?",
      "The cover art is immediately provocative. In the photo, Carpenter kneels on all fours wearing a tight black dress. Her hand rests on a man's leg. His hand, meanwhile, holds a chunk of her blond hair. Carpenter stares at the camera with an open-mouthed expression.",
      "On Instagram, Carpenter shared another image: A closeup of a dog wearing a collar with the words \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "She captioned the post, \"My new album, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend' \ud83d\udc3e is out on August 29, 2025. I can\u2019t wait for it to be yours x Pre-order now.\"",
      "What are fans saying about the art?",
      "The art has gotten mixed reactions from fans, as evidenced by the comments on the original post and multiple Reddit threads.",
      "In the comments of Carpenter's post, people used words like \"disgusting\" and \"disturbing\" to describe the imagery, saying it was \"not a very empowering image for women.\" Another told her to \"please please please stand UP.\"",
      "Others tried to read into the image's connection to the album's title and found a deeper meaning.",
      "\"Man\u2019s best friend double meaning for dogs and female dogs are b---hes so it\u2019s a play on the ideology of men being so dependent on women,\" one commenter said. \"Her cover shows her being in a submissive role but in reality she\u2019s the one who has actual control.\"",
      "Commenters debated back-and-forth. One said they were getting \"secondhand embarrassment\" by looking at the picture. Another responded, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to embarrass women but rather to show how women are regarded by certain men.\"",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Carpenter's reps for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "What is Sabrina Carpenter trying to say? A PR expert breaks it down",
      "Beth Booker, public perception expert and creator of \"The Uncensored Publicist,\" says the artwork should be situated within Carpenter's own brand and the way female pop stars are often marketed.",
      "The image is a familiar one at first: A \u201cfemale pop star posed and packaged perfectly for the male gaze,\" Booker says, comparing it to Britney Spears in the early 2000s or Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" era.",
      "However, Booker sees this as Carpenter \"flipping the script\" on a familiar format. Since humor is such a \"huge part of her brand,\" she says this should be interpreted with a wink.",
      "\"The cover is hypersexualized, yes, but intentionally exaggerated to feel almost absurd,\" she says. \"She\u2019s sexy, but she\u2019s also funny, self-aware, and in complete control of how she\u2019s being seen.\"",
      "Booker says that Carpenter's submissive posture in the photo is not an indication she's like that in real life.",
      "\"She\u2019s not performing desire for someone else\u2019s approval, she\u2019s expressing it for herself and her audience. The title, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend,' directly nods to how women have been labeled 'b-----s' for decades and she\u2019s essentially saying: fine, I\u2019ll take the word, flip it, and turn it into part of my brand,\" Booker says.",
      "Fans are debating Carpenter's intentions, which Booker says may have been Carpenter's intention.",
      "\"That confusion is the point. Great pop culture lives in that gray area where people aren\u2019t quite sure how they\u2019re supposed to feel. Is it satire? Is it sexy? The answer is yes. She knows exactly how this image would land and she\u2019s allowing people to sit in that tension because that\u2019s what keeps the conversation going. She\u2019s not being provocative accidentally, she\u2019s doing it on her own terms,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe fact that some people, even some of her own fans, are uncomfortable with it actually reinforces the point. Brand evolution doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable in real time, and that\u2019s part of what makes this moment important for her career.\u201d",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is Carpenter's seventh studio album and it'll follow the release of \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d her sixth studio album, which won pop album of the year at the 2025 Grammys.",
      "What did Sabrina Carpenter say about the cover art for 'Man's Best Friend'?",
      "Days after Carpenter unveiled the cover art for \"Man's Best Friend,\" her upcoming album, she replied to someone questioning the photo.",
      "A X user commented, \u201cDoes she have a personality outside of sex?\u201d reposting the cover art.",
      "On June 16, Carpenter commented, \u201cgirl yes and it is goooooood.\u201d"

      "Wilson explains that while she herself would \u201coften eat a lot of junk food,\u201d parents would \u201cnever deliberately feed your child rubbish.\u201d And avoiding feeding her child \"rubbish\" is a good way to keep her own health goals on track.",

      "Curtis, who's been open about her love for her new friend Hargitay, was equally as supportive of Hargitay's personal project.",
      "\u201cI think any time we can see women step up and out and into the light of their truth, and do it with grace and humor and love and beauty, that\u2019s a message that I think does translate,\u201d Curtis told TODAY.com at the premiere event.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s been carrying her family story for a long time, and it\u2019s time for her to shed it in this gorgeous documentary and now step free as an artist,\u201d she added. \u201cNow we have a filmmaker.\u201d",
      "Hargitay said she was \u201cvery afraid\u201d to make the film during a Q&A moderated by Griffin Dunne after the screening of the documentary.",
      "\u201cLearning to lean into the sharp edges and tolerate the uncomfortable feelings and sort of breathe through it, and then coming out the other side to this gorgeous support, these beautiful humans, all these people that were just trying to do the best that they can, and they did,\u201d she said. \u201cI look at it now, and I\u2019m so grateful for the choices that were made for me.\u201d",
      "In the film, Hargitay opens up about the moment in her 20s when she learned her biological father was not Mickey Hargitay, who raised her, but an Italian singer named Nelson Sardelli, whom Mansfield had an affair with in the process of divorcing Mickey Hargitay.",
      "Mariska Hargitay met Sardelli when she was 30 but continued to keep the secret about her parentage until now.",
      "At the Carnegie Hall Q&A, she expressed her gratitude for being able to be the one to share her journey about such a delicate topic in her own time.",
      "\u201cBut what I find so amazing is that this story has not gone out there, and it was mine to tell,\u201d she said.",
      "One constant in the film is Mansfield\u2019s love of music. The 1950s Hollywood starlet played piano and the violin, including in some of her television appearances, like on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201d",
      "At one point in the archival footage, Mansfield says she one day hopes to play at Carnegie Hall. While this dream never came to fruition before her death at 34 after a car accident, the crowd at Carnegie Hall June 13 erupted into applause for Mansfield and her legacy, told through the eyes of her daughter.",
      "Hargitay described the access to archival materials about her mom as \u201ca gift from God.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd forget this filmmaker, director, or editor, producer, just as a person, as a little girl looking for their mother, and then I just got all this footage of all these moments of her speaking \u2026 and not playing the role,\u201d she said to the crowd. \u201cAnd that was what I wanted. That\u2019s what I was after.\u201d",
      "Hargitay said she \u201cwent into the movie truly not liking the sound of my mother\u2019s voice.\u201d Mansfield was known for her breathy, higher-pitched voice in her on-camera appearances.",
      "\u201cEven in the beginning, listening to it, I was like, cringe,\u201d Hargitay explained. \u201cAnd then as the movie went on, and I got to hear her real voice. And tonight, as I was getting ready, I was playing her music and listening to songs that I had heard before. And everything has been reframed.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy Mom Jayne\u201d will air June 27 on HBO at 8 p.m. ET and stream on HBO Max."

    "summary": "Eric Braeden talks in an interview with TODAY.com about his wife, son, co-stars and 45 years on \"The Young and the Restless\" as Victor Newman.",
    "story": [
      "Eric Braeden has a break in between filming scenes for \"The Young and The Restless,\" and he's waiting for me in his dressing room.",
      "It's the third time we've spoken over the last two years and the first time we've met in person. As a lifelong fan of the CBS daytime drama, I'm excited to finally come face to face with the man who has played business tycoon Victor Newman for the last 45 years.",
      "On \"Y&R,\" Braeden's character is known for his ardent family values and ruthless business moves: a rare combination that sometimes puts him in compromising positions.",
      "In person, Braeden certainly has a commanding presence at just over 6 feet tall, but he also possesses a warm, playful nature that has won the hearts of countless fans and colleagues alike.",
      "Case in point? Braeden greets me at the door of his dressing room by pretending to peek outside the door and hide for a second. Then he gives me a big hug.",
      "After talking about my flight to California, Braeden and I chat for a few moments before diving into the matter at hand: a conversation about his 45th anniversary on \"Y&R.\"",
      "When I ask how he celebrated such a colossal milestone back in February, the 84-year-old has a simple response.",
      "\"I personally don\u2019t celebrate much. You just sit back and you allow yourself to say, 'Whoa, that\u2019s a long time.' I'm not someone who rests on laurels. I don\u2019t do that,\" he explains. \"I\u2019m always future oriented. I'm always (asking), 'What's next? Let's go.'\"",
      "It's a mentality that has served Braeden well throughout his decades-long career in Hollywood and one that helped him cope with the loss of his house amid the California wildfires earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t allow myself to think about that too much because I have known people who then get dragged down by it,\" he says.",
      "Braeden and his wife of nearly 60 years, Dale Russell Gudegast, have found a \"semi-permanent place\" to live as they sort out plans to rebuild their home.",
      "For Braeden, having something to look forward to helps keep him motivated.",
      "\"The solution lies in action, in doing,\" he says.",
      "Braeden, who was born Hans J\u00f6rg Gudegast and grew up in Germany, is certainly a doer. At the age of 18, he moved from Germany to the U.S. and worked a variety of jobs before stumbling into the entertainment industry.",
      "Now, his acting credits run the gamut of film, theater and TV, including roles in \"Titanic,\" \"The Rat Patrol,\" \"Colossus: The Forbin Project\" and countless others.",
      "While building his career, Braeden once visited the set of a soap opera but didn't give the medium much thought again until he later got the opportunity to take on the role of Victor Newman in 1980.",
      "Ironically, the actor was never supposed to stay at \u201cY&R\u201d very long. But as he settled into the temporary role, fans grew to love Victor, and Braeden was offered a long-term contract.",
      "The only problem? Braeden wasn't sold on the character. So he spoke to his wife, who encouraged him to look at the role as a challenge. Then, he sat down with Bill Bell, the co-creator of \"Y&R.\"",
      "\"I said, 'Bill, I\u2019m tired of playing only bad guys. I\u2019ve done that for so many years, on nighttime television, films.' I said, 'Can we attribute a background to this character that explains why he is who he is?' Because we all are formed by it. And he came up with the storyline where I tell Nikki (Newman) that I grew up in an orphanage. I then knew I would stay,\" he recalls.",
      "Braeden's character has been at the center of a plethora of captivating storylines over the years, but he's particularly fond of one that featured Dorothy McGuire and George Kennedy playing his on-screen mother and father.",
      "\"All of that creates the bedrock for what Victor Newman became, and that was the brilliance of Bill Bell, who came up with that storyline,\" Braeden says. \"Those are by far, hands down, the most seminal scenes I\u2019ve done in the show explaining who Victor Newman is.\"",
      "Victor has had many romantic interests over the course of 45 years, but none compare to his epic love story with Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott).",
      "\"The reason Mel and I have been doing it so long is because she gets me. Mel knows how to deal with me. ... And I with her,\" he says while complimenting his \"clever\" and talented co-star.",
      "As the head of Newman Enterprises, Victor is known as a master manipulator in the world of business. But in real life, Braeden says he doesn't possess the same penchant for corporate subterfuge.",
      "\u201cObviously, I don\u2019t do anything that Victor does. I\u2019m not a business guy,\u201d he says, noting that he does have a few things in common with his character.",
      "For instance, Victor never shies away from a fight, and Braeden shares the same signature tenacity.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to confrontation, I don\u2019t back down. I don\u2019t give a f--- who it is. I don\u2019t back down. And that has been the case with me since I was a young boy,\u201d he says.",
      "Victor is known for meddling in his family\u2019s affairs, especially their romantic escapades. But Braeden takes a more even-keeled approach.",
      "\"I love my family and would never dictate to my family,\" he says.",
      "Speaking of family, Braeden lights up when I bring up his son, Christian Gudegast, whom he refers to as his \u201cgreatest accomplishment\u201d in his book, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Damned.\u201d",
      "In a way, Gudegast has followed in his father's footsteps, pursuing a career as a writer and director.",
      "\"I always sort of wanted him to become an actor. And only about half a year ago, he told me why he didn\u2019t want it. Because he saw me at certain times in my life very upset about not getting this or that role,\u201d he explains.",
      "Braeden sent his son to acting school to give him a solid foundation as a director and has supported his dreams ever since.",
      "Braeden's passion for his craft is evident as he recounts his iconic career. Although he had many notable acting credits to his name before joining the cast of \"Y&R,\" he tells me that the soap opera taught him something invaluable about the significance of an actor's work.",
      "\u201cOne of the most profound meanings is to entertain people. I learned that here in this medium and I\u2019m very grateful,\" he says. \"I\u2019m very grateful to fans for that reason because they taught me what this is about \u2014 entertainment,\" he says.",
      "While talking about the volume of work he and his colleagues produce on a weekly basis, the soap opera veteran's pride is evident.",
      "\"I think it\u2019s the toughest medium there is in Hollywood. I\u2019ve done it all,\" he says. \"For writers, this is the hardest job in all of Hollywood, writing for a soap. As an actor, it is equally much the hardest job there is.\"",
      "Braeden goes on to describe just how much work goes into filming a soap opera.",
      "\"In film, we do two or three pages a day,\" he explains.",
      "On the opposite end of the spectrum, Braeden says soap operas typically shoot 100 pages of dialogue a day. As a main star of the show, he's certainly in demand and has a record of shooting 62 pages of dialogue in one day.",
      "I get to witness Braeden in action filming scenes for an upcoming episode, and it's easy to see why he's so respected by his colleagues.",
      "The industry veteran handles his lines with ease and also imbues a sense of fun into his work, chatting animatedly with his co-stars and the crew.",
      "While reading Braeden's autobiography, I was intrigued by a passage where he discusses a quote from playwright and screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who defined happiness as \"insensitivity.\"",
      "After losing his father at the age of 12 and navigating poverty at a young age, I'm curious to know if Braeden's worldview was shaped by these formative experiences and how he himself defines happiness.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing in and of itself. It\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s b-------.  (Happiness is) in the doing, and it\u2019s in the few moments after the doing that you feel, \u2018Well, I accomplished something. Great.\u2019 That\u2019s it. A few minutes afterwards, then you\u2019ve got to plan another thing to do. There\u2019s no permanent happiness state,\u201d he explains.",
      "The answer is consistent with the way Braeden has progressed in his career: constantly on the move, consistently challenging himself.",
      "The actor shows no signs of slowing down, and I can't help but selfishly wonder if he will ever leave \"Y&R\" to enjoy a proper retirement. Luckily for me and countless other fans, he has no plans of stepping away from his career anytime soon.",
      "\u201cI love doing what I\u2019m doing. I love doing it. I don\u2019t know why, but I do,\u201d he says."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 British lawmakers voted Tuesday to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales after a lawmaker argued it was cruel to prosecute women for ending a pregnancy.",
      "The House of Commons approved an amendment to a broader crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished under an antiquated law.",
      "Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, the Labour member of Parliament who introduced one of the amendments, said the change was needed because police have investigated more than 100 women for suspected illegal abortions over the past five years, including some who suffered natural miscarriages and stillbirths.",
      "\u201cThis piece of legislation will only take women out of the criminal justice system because they are vulnerable and they need our help,\u201d she said. \u201cJust what public interest is this serving? This is not justice, it is cruelty and it has got to end.\u201d",
      "The amendment passed 379-137. The House of Commons will now need to pass the crime bill, which is expected, before it goes to the House of Lords, where it can be delayed but not blocked.",
      "Under current law, doctors can legally carry out abortions in England, Scotland and Wales up to 24 weeks, and beyond that under special circumstances, such as when the life of the mother is in danger. Abortion in Northern Ireland was decriminalized in 2019.",
      "Changes in the law implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic allow women to receive abortion pills through the mail and terminate their own pregnancies at home within the first 10 weeks.",
      "That has led to a handful of widely publicized cases in which women were prosecuted for illegally obtaining abortion pills and using them to end their own pregnancies after 24 weeks or more.",
      "Anti-abortion groups opposed the measures, arguing it would open the door to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy.",
      "\u201cUnborn babies will have any remaining protection stripped away, and women will be left at the mercy of abusers,\u201d said Alithea Williams, public policy manager for the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which describes itself as the U.K.\u2019s biggest pro-life campaign group.",
      "The debate came after recent prosecutions have galvanized support to repeal parts of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act.",
      "In one case, a mother of three was sentenced to more than two years in prison in 2023 for medically inducing an abortion about eight months into her pregnancy.",
      "Carla Foster, 45, was released about a month later by an appeals court that reduced her sentence. Judge Victoria Sharp said that case called for \u201ccompassion, not punishment\u201d and there was no useful purpose in jailing her.",
      "Last month, a jury acquitted Nicola Packer on a charge of unlawfully self-administering poison or a noxious thing with intent to procure a miscarriage. Packer, who took abortion medicine when she was about 26 weeks pregnant, testified that she did not know she had been pregnant more than 10 weeks.",
      "Supporters of the bill said it was a landmark reform that would keep women from going to prison for ending their pregnancy.",
      "\u201cAt a time when we\u2019re seeing rollbacks on reproductive rights, most notably in the United States, this crucial milestone in the fight for reproductive rights sends a powerful message that our lawmakers are standing up for women,\u201d said Louise McCudden of MSI Reproductive Choices.",
      "A second amendment that would have gone even further than Antoniazzi\u2019s proposal, barring the prosecution of medical professionals and others who help women abort their fetuses, did not get to a vote.",
      "A competing Conservative measure that would have required an in-person appointment for a pregnant woman to get abortion pills was defeated."

      "\u201cGrowing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honor,\" Beckham said in a statement issued Friday through the Press Association news agency.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, was almost inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he had not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and near-permanent fixtures in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "\u201cIt will take a little while for the news to sink in but I\u2019m immensely proud and it\u2019s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family,\" Beckham said.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of \u201992,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. That culminated in the club's winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four countries.",
      "\u201cTo have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true,\u201d he said in his statement.",
      "Beckham was an elegant player, and his intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the Los Angeles Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "\u201cOff the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation,\" his statement said. \"I\u2019m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I\u2019m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\"",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While they are awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

Only the United States possesses the large \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs that can reach Iran\u2019s underground Fordow uranium enrichment site.

He also vowed that if voters re-elected him, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have peace in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "What he has discovered is that both conflicts reflect historical grievance and raw political calculations that don\u2019t vanish when a new president takes power, foreign policy experts said.

    "story": [
      "MADRID \u2014 Spain\u2019s government said Tuesday that the massive April power outage across Spain and Portugal that left tens of millions of people disconnected in seconds was caused by technical and planning errors that left the grid unable to handle a surge in voltage.",
      "Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen, who manages the nation\u2019s energy policy, told reporters that a voltage surge led to small grid failures, mainly in the south of Spain, which then cascaded to larger ones and brought the system down in the two Iberian Peninsula nations.",
      "She ruled out that the failure was due to a cyberattack.",
      "The outage began shortly after noon on April 28 in Spain and lasted through nightfall, disrupting businesses, transit systems, cellular networks, internet connectivity and other critical infrastructure. Spain lost 15 gigawatts of electricity \u2014 or about 60% of its supply. Portugal, whose grid is connected to Spain\u2019s, also went down. Only the countries\u2019 island territories were spared.",
      "\u201cAll of this happened in 12 seconds, with most of the power loss happening in just five seconds,\u201d Aagesen said.",
      "Several technical causes contributed to the event, including \u201cpoor planning\u201d by Spain\u2019s grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica, which didn\u2019t find a replacement for one power plant that was supposed to help balance power fluctuations, the minister said. She also said that some power plants that utilities shut off preventively when the disruptions started could have stayed online to help manage the system.",
      "Power was fully restored by the early hours of the following day.",
      "The government\u2019s report was to be released later Tuesday \u2014 49 days after the event \u2014 and included analysis from Spain\u2019s national security agencies, which concluded, according to the minister, that there were no indications of cyber-sabotage by foreign actors.",
      "The government had previously narrowed down the source of the outage to three power plants that tripped in southern Spain.",
      "In the weeks following the blackout, citizens and experts were left wondering what triggered the event in a region not known for power cuts. The outage ignited a fierce debate about whether Spain\u2019s high levels of renewable power and not enough energy generated from nuclear or gas-fired power plants had something to do with the grid failing, which the government has repeatedly denied.",
      "Spain is at the forefront of Europe\u2019s transition to renewable energy, having generated nearly 57% of its electricity in 2024 from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydropower and solar. The country is also phasing out its nuclear plants.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez pushed back against such speculation and defended the country\u2019s rapid ramping up of renewables. He asked for patience and said that his government would not \u201cdeviate a single millimeter\u201d from its energy transition plans, which include a goal of generating 81% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030."

      "LEMBATA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia\u2019s Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted with giant ash and smoke plumes again Wednesday after forcing evacuations of villages and flight cancellations, including to and from the resort island of Bali.",
      "Several eruptions sent ash up to 16,400 feet into the sky Tuesday evening to Wednesday afternoon. An eruption Tuesday afternoon sent thick, gray clouds about 32,800 feet into the sky that expanded into a mushroom-shaped ash cloud visible as much as 93 miles away.",
      "The eruption alert was raised Tuesday to the highest level and the danger zone where people are recommended to leave was expanded to 5 miles from the crater.",
      "Officers also evacuated from the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post 4.3 miles from the crater to avoid falling gravel released in the eruption. No casualties have been reported.",
      "Ash and debris fell in a number of places outside the danger zone, including the villages of Boru, Hewa and Watobuku. Some residents from Nurabelen village in Ile Bura subdistrict fled to evacuation sites in Konga to avoid the impact of the eruption, the National Disaster Management Agency said in a statement.",
      "\u201cSome residents have also evacuated to Nileknoheng village, which is 7.4 miles from the crater,\u201d said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "Dozens of flights Wednesday were canceled, including those connecting Bali to cities in Australia, Malaysia, India and China, according to the website of Bali\u2019s I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport. Volcanic ash can pose a risk to plane engines.",
      "Flights also were canceled to and from the international airport in Labuan Bajo, another tourist destination in Flores Island, East Nusa Tenggara province. The airport is still operating.",
      "The cancellations and delays affected thousands of travelers. Australian carrier Jetstar, which flies daily between the tourist hotspot and several Australian cities, said the ash cloud was forecast to clear by late Wednesday and its services would be rescheduled.",
      "Air New Zealand canceled one return trip to Auckland and said it would rebook customers on the next available service. Flights to New Delhi, Singapore and Pudong, China, were also canceled due to the volcano, according to information on the website for Denpasar airport in Bali.",
      "The 5,197-foot Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki is a twin volcano with Mount Lewotobi Perempuan in the district of Flores Timur.",
      "The volcano has had several eruptions, and its danger level and no-go zone have changed several times before being raised again to the highest level Tuesday.",
      "An eruption of Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki in November killed nine people and injured dozens. It also erupted in March.",
      "Indonesia is an archipelago of 270 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea will send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to support reconstruction work in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, a top Russian official said Tuesday, the latest sign of expanding cooperation between the nations.",
      "North Korea has already supplied thousands of combat troops and a vast amount of conventional weapons to back Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. In April, Pyongyang and Moscow said that their soldiers fought together to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk border region, though Ukraine has insisted it still has troops present there.",
      "Wrapping up a one-day visit to Pyongyang, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un decided to send 1,000 sappers to clear mines in the Kursk region and 5,000 military construction workers to restore infrastructure there, according to Russia\u2019s state news agency, Tass.",
      "Another Russian state news agency, RIA Novosti, carried a similar report.",
      "\u201cFollowing the expulsion of invaders from Russian soil, we\u2019ve agreed to continue our constructive cooperation, with the Korean side providing assistance in the restoration of the Kursk region,\u201d Shoigu said, according to RIA Novosti. \u201cThis is a kind of brotherly aid being sent by the Korean people and their leader, Kim Jong Un, to our country.\u201d",
      "Shoigu said that Moscow and Pyongyang agreed to erect memorials in both countries in honor of North Korean soldiers who died while fighting in the Kursk region, according to Tass and RIA Novosti.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim confirmed the contents of North Korea\u2019s cooperation with Russia with regard to Kursk\u2019s current situation but did not mention the dispatch of army construction workers and deminers cited by Russian media.",
      "KCNA quoted Kim as expressing his resolve to \u201cinvariably and unconditionally support\u201d what he called Russian efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Kim has previously made similar comments in support of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "KCNA also said that Kim and Shoigu approved some plans for \u201cconveying long the heroic feats displayed by\u201d North Korean troops in operations to liberate the Kursk area, an apparent reference to the memorial construction plan.",
      "North Korea and Russia have never disclosed how many North Korean troops have been sent to Russia or how many of them were killed. But according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukrainian assessments, about 15,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia. South Korea\u2019s spy agency said in April that about 600 North Korean soldiers died on the Russia-Ukraine battlefronts.",
      "The deepening ties between North Korea and Russia have raised worries among the U.S., South Korea and their partners that Russian President Vladimir Putin may in return provide Kim with much-needed sophisticated technologies that can help advance his nuclear and missile programs.",
      "The two countries, both in confrontations with the U.S. and its allies, have sharply grown closer to each other in recent years. In 2024, Kim and Putin signed a landmark defense treaty that requires each side to provide aid if the other is attacked.",
      "It was Shoigu\u2019s third visit to North Korea in about three months. The two countries have exchanged high-level visits in past years, with Kim traveling to Russia in 2023 and Putin to North Korea in 2024. Many observers say Kim could soon visit Russia again for another summit with Putin.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Russia\u2019s employment of North Korean workers was a clear violation of U.N. sanctions, which require member states not to issue work permits to North Koreans.",
      "The U.S. State Department told South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency that Russia\u2019s continued use of North Korean workers and soldiers was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and that Pyongyang was \u201cnow relying on Russia to provide it with desperately needed funds in exchange for labor and soldier for hire schemes.\u201d",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba also expressed deep concern, saying advancing cooperation between Russia and North Korea threatens to jeopardize global security.",
      "On Wednesday, South Korea, the U.S. and Japan flew fighter jets for a trilateral aerial training off South Korea\u2019s southern Jeju island as part of their efforts to strengthen security cooperation to cope with North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear threats, according to the South Korean air force."

      "Iran plunged into a near-total internet blackout Tuesday as Israel continued to bombard the country.",
      "Two companies that track global internet connectivity, Kentinc and Netblocks, told NBC News that Iran\u2019s internet connectivity plummeted around 5:30 p.m. local time, limiting Iranians\u2019 ability to access and share information with the outside world as the country becomes more deeply involved in conflict.",
      "The drop appears to be a result of a decision by Iran\u2019s government, rather than Israeli strikes on infrastructure. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran\u2019s government, said it had restricted internet access in response to Israeli cyberattacks.",
      "Iran\u2019s government has historically shut down or reduced its internet connectivity with the outside world in times of civil unrest. Most recently, in 2019, it implemented a six-day full blackout as protesters took to the streets across the country and the government issued a crackdown on civilians, reportedly leading to the deaths of more than 100 people.",
      "The country\u2019s internet access has been reduced, but not fully blocked, in the aftermath of Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran last week, which Iran has said killed at least 224 people. Israel said Iran\u2019s retaliatory attacks have killed at least 24.",

      "A WhatsApp spokesperson told NBC News that its parent company, Meta, has been engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with Iran, which has been blocking internet providers used by the company.",
      "Iran\u2019s National Information Network, a nationwide network of government-approved sites that are not connected to the outside world, has largely remained accessible to people in Iran.",

Starlink\u2019s parent company, SpaceX, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit group that advocates for information access in closed societies, said it estimates that 30,000 to 40,000 Starlink terminals are spread across Iran, based on network scans and conversations with people involved in selling them to people in the country.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s National Cybersecurity Command announced that Israel had launched a broad cyberwarfare campaign against Iran\u2019s digital infrastructure to disrupt services to the public, but it did not provide specifics of what was affected.",
      "The Iranian news site Shargh Daily reported that Iran\u2019s cyber police agency, FATA, said Tuesday that the government had imposed some internet disruptions after the cyberattacks and that service would be restored soon.",
      "The statement came after a prominent pro-Israel hacker group that calls itself Predatory Sparrow claimed on X and Telegram, where it maintains a social media presence, to have conducted a destructive cyberattack against Bank Sepah, a national bank under U.S. sanctions for allegations of ties to Iran\u2019s military.",
      "Some Iranian ATMs were not functional Tuesday, a source on the ground said.",
      "The members of Predatory Sparrow are unknown, and the group did not respond to a request for comment. It was not possible to determine whether the group is affiliated with any Israeli military or intelligence agency.",

      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff planned to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "A museum in limbo",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks."

      "Malik Tillman scored twice and Diego Luna had a pair of assists in a 5-0 rout of Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday in the Americans' CONCACAF Gold Cup opener.",
      "\"Really important I think to cut a little bit this \u2014 I don't say negativity, but, yes ... but it's really important now to start the competition with a good feeling,\" U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said.",
      "Victory in the Group D opener ended a four-game losing streak and came after days of controversy over Christian Pulisic's desire to rest during the Gold Cup and Pochettino not including the star in a pair of pre-tournament friendlies the attacker offered to play in.",
      "Tillman scored in the 16th and 41st minutes for his first two international goals, both following giveaways by Alvin Jones, and Patrick Agyemang scored his fourth international goal in the 44th when Luna's shot deflected off a foot.",
      "\"It was in our hands to show a reaction and I think we've done it today,\" Tillman said. \"We played a good game and it was nice to bounce back, have a good start to the tournament.\"",
      "Brenden Aaronson added his ninth goal in the 82nd and Haji Wright his fifth just 1 minute, 13 seconds later for the 16th-ranked Americans, who drew just 12,610 to PayPal Park.",
      "\"Malik is a talented player. It's obvious that everyone can see,\" Pochettino said. \"October, November, when we met for the first time I think it was difficult to create this relationship that the player need(s) and the coach need(s) to trust and to trust each other. ... I think now after a few weeks together I really start to understand him and he starts to understand us. And he's very special, a very special talent and a very special kid.\"",
      "Luna, a 21-year-old who impressed Pochettino during his debut in January when he insisted he stay on the field with a broken nose, was playing not far from where he grew up and said he had gotten tickets for about 30 family and friends.",
      "\"Just an honor, right, to be able to dream about this day,\" he said. \"(To) start off a tournament like this back in my home city is awesome.\"",
      "Luna ran onto Jones' back pass, dribbled down the left flank and crossed to Tillman for the second goal, then shot from just inside the penalty area for the goal that glanced off Tillman for a 3-0 lead.",
      "\"His performance was really good. He showed his character,\" Pochettino said.",
      "The Americans have won their group in 16 of 17 Gold Cups, along with a second-place finish behind Panama in 2011, and improved their group stage record to 41 wins, one loss and five draws. They play invited guest Saudi Arabia on Thursday at Austin, Texas, then close group play on June 22 against Haiti at Arlington, Texas.",
      "Matt Freese was in goal in place of Matt Turner, who had started 14 consecutive competitive matches for the U.S. and 23 of 24 dating to the 2022 World Cup. The lone exception was a Gold Cup group stage game against St. Kitts and Nevis in 2023.",
      "Pochettino said he wanted to create competition for Turner, who didn't get into a Crystal Palace match after March 1. The coach said Turner told him he was disappointed with the decision but understood it and would compete to get playing time."
