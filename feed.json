      "Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos has canceled her upcoming performances at the Kennedy Center in Washington",
      "NEW YORK -- Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos is the latest performer to cancel an appearance at the Kennedy Center in Washington. She had been scheduled to give two concerts for young people on Feb. 7, followed by a \u201ccreative conversation\u201d with the audience.",
      "De Los Santos, a Mexican American whose 2018 release \u201c\u00a1Alegr\u00eda!\u201d received a Latin Grammy nomination for best children's album, cited her background as a reason for calling off the shows.",
      "\"As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,\" she wrote Thursday on Instagram. \u201cUnfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.\u201d",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, De Los Santos shared her Instagram statement and said she would have no additional comment. Kennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi challenged De Los Santos' citing of immigration policy.",
      "\u201cThis country was built on legal immigrants and as a first generation American, I find her statement highly offensive,\" Daravi wrote in an email. \"Refusing to engage with an institution open to everyone is, in fact, a step towards discrimination.\u201d",
      "Artists ranging from \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to rock star Peter Wolf have called off events at the Kennedy Center since President Donald Trump ousted the previous leadership early last year and arranged for himself to head the board of trustees. Trump has highlighted the Kennedy Center in his wide-ranging fight against what he calls \u201cwoke\u201d bias at cultural institutions.",

      "The board's decision in December to rebrand the venue the Trump-Kennedy Center, a change that scholars say can only be enacted through Congress, led to a new wave of cancellations. Jazz musician Chuck Redd called off a planned Christmas Eve show, and the jazz group The Cookers withdrew from their New Year's Eve concerts.",
      "Last week, the Grammy-winning banjo player Bela Fleck announced that he had canceled three scheduled appearances next month with the National Symphony Orchestra, writing on social media that playing at the center had become \u201ccharged and political.\u201d Ric Grenell, a diplomat and Trump ally whom the president appointed to lead the center, wrote on X that Fleck had \u201cmade it political and caved to the woke mob.\u201d",
      "Other recent withdrawals include \u201cWicked\u201d composer Stephen Schwartz, who had been expected to host an opera gala in the spring, and the variety show Asian AF, whose shows in May were listed as canceled on the Kennedy Center website, then removed entirely. Daravi cited a \u201cscheduling conflict.\u201d A representative for Asian AF did not immediately responds to requests for comment.",

      "Harvey Weinstein is returning to a New York court",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein returns to court Thursday, seeking to get his latest sex crime conviction thrown out because anger and apprehensions flared among jurors during deliberations last spring.",
      "It's the latest convoluted turn in the former Hollywood honcho's path through the criminal justice system. His landmark #MeToo-era case has spanned seven years, trials in two states, a reversal in one and a retrial that came to a messy end in New York last year. Weinstein was convicted of forcing oral sex on one woman, acquitted of forcibly performing oral sex on another, and the jury didn't decide on a rape charge involving a third woman \u2014 a charge prosecutors vowed to retry yet again.",
      "Weinstein, 73, denies all the charges. They were one outgrowth of a stack of sexual harassment and sex assault allegations against him that emerged publicly in 2017 and ensuing years, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Early on, Weinstein apologized for \u201cthe way I've behaved with colleagues in the past,\u201d while also denying that he ever had non-consensual sex.",
      "At trial, Weinstein's lawyers argued that the women willingly accepted his advances in hopes of getting work in various capacities in show business, then falsely accused him to net settlement funds and attention.",
      "The split verdict last June came after multiple jurors took the unusual step of asking to brief the judge on behind-the-scenes tensions.",
      "In a series of exchanges partly in open court, one juror complained that others were \u201cshunning\u201d one of the panel members; the foreperson alluded to jurors \u201cpushing people\u201d verbally and talking about Weinstein's \u201cpast\u201d in a way the juror thought improper; yet a third juror opined that discussions were \u201cgoing well.\u201d The foreperson later came forward again to complain to the judge about being pressured to change his mind, then said he feared for his safety because a fellow panelist had said he would \u201csee me outside.\u201d The foreperson eventually refused to continue deliberating.",
      "In court, Judge Curtis Farber cited the secrecy of ongoing deliberations and reminded jurors not to disclose \u201cthe content or tenor\u201d of them. Since the trial, Weinstein's lawyers have talked with the first juror who openly complained and with another who didn't.",
      "In sworn statements, the two said they didn't believe Weinstein was guilty, but had given in because of other jurors' verbal aggression.",

      "Weinstein's lawyers contend the tensions amounted to threats that poisoned the process, and that the judge didn't look into them enough before denying the defense's repeated requests for a mistrial. Weinstein's attorneys are asking him to discard the conviction or, at least, conduct a hearing about the jury strains.",
      "Prosecutors maintain that the judge was presented with claims about \u201cscattered instances of contentious interactions\u201d and handled them appropriately. Jurors' later sworn statements are belied, prosecutors say, by other comments from one of the same jury members. He told the media right after the trial that there \u201cwas just high tension\u201d in the group.",
      "Prosecutors also said the foreperson\u2019s concerns about discussions of Weinstein\u2019s past were vague and the topic wasn\u2019t entirely off-limits. Testimony covered, for example, 2017 media reports about decades of sexual harassment allegations against him.",
      "The judge is expected to respond Thursday. He could set the conviction aside, order a hearing or let the verdict stand without any further action. Whatever he decides could be appealed.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors have said they're prepared to retry Weinstein on the rape charge the jury couldn't decide last spring. Currently being held in New York, he also is appealing a rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "In February 1977, Tony Kiritsis walked into the Meridian Mortgage Company in downtown Indianapolis and took one of its executives, Dick Hall, hostage. Kiritsis held a sawed-off shotgun to the back of Hall's head and draped a wire around his neck that connected to the gun. If he moved too much, he would die.",
      "The subsequent standoff moved to Kiritsis\u2019 apartment and eventually concluded in a live televised news conference. The whole ordeal received some renewed attention in a 2022 podcast dramatization starring Jon Hamm.",
      "But in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d starring Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Kiritsis, these events are vividly brought to life by Van Sant. It\u2019s been seven years since Van Sant directed, following 2018\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot,\u201d and one of the prevailing takeaways of his new film is that that\u2019s too long of a break for a filmmaker of Van Sant's caliber.",
      "Working from a script by Austin Kolodney, the filmmaker of \u201cMy Own Private Idaho\u201d and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d turns \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d into not a period-piece time capsule but a bracingly relevant drama of outrage and inequality. Tony feels aggrieved by his mortgage company over a land deal the bank, he claims, blocked. We\u2019re never given many specifics, but at the same time, there\u2019s little doubt in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d that Tony\u2019s cause is just. His means might be desperate and abhorrent, but the movie is very definitely on his side.",
      "That\u2019s owed significantly to Skarsg\u00e5rd, who gives one of his finest and least adorned performances. While best known for films like \u201cIt,\u201d \u201cThe Crow\u201d and \u201cNosferatu,\u201d here Skarsg\u00e5rd has little more than some green polyester and a very \u201970s mustache to alter his looks. The straightforward, jittery intensity of his performance propels \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "Yet Van Sant\u2019s film aspires to be a larger ensemble drama, which it only partially succeeds at. Tony\u2019s plight is far from a solitary one, as numerous threads suggest in Kolodney\u2019s fast-paced script. First and foremost is Colman Domingo as a local DJ named Fred Temple. (If ever there were an actor suited, with a smooth baritone, to play a \u201970s radio DJ, it\u2019s Domingo.) Tony, a fan, calls Fred to air his demands. But it\u2019s not just a media outlet for him. Fred touts himself as \u201cthe voice of the people.\u201d",

As much as he tortures his hostage (a very good Dacre Montgomery), he\u2019s kind to the police officers surrounding him. And as he and Dick spend more time together, Dick emerges as a kind of victim, himself. It\u2019s his father\u2019s bank, and when Tony gets M.L. Hall (Al Pacino) on the phone, he sounds painfully insensitive, sooner ready to sacrifice his son than acknowledge any wrongdoing.",
      "Pacino\u2019s presence in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d is a nod to \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d a movie that may be far better \u2014 but, then again, that\u2019s true of most films in comparison to Sidney Lumet\u2019s unsurpassed 1975 classic. Still, Van Sant\u2019s film bears some of the same rage and disillusionment with the meatgrinder of capitalism as \u201cDog Day.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also a telling, if not entirely successful subplot of a local TV news reporter (Myha\u2019la) struggling against stereotypes. Even when she gets the goods on the unspooling news story, the way her producer says to \u201cchop it up\u201d and put it on air makes it clear: Whatever Tony is rebelling against, it\u2019s him, not his plight, that will be served up on a prime-time plate.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take recent similar cases of national fascination, such as Luigi Mangione, charged with killing a healthcare executive, to see contemporary echoes of Kiritsis' tale. The real story is more complicated and less metaphor-ready, of course, than the movie, which detracts some from the film's gritty sense of verisimilitude. Staying closer to the truth might have produced a more dynamic movie.",
      "But \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d still works. In the film, Tony\u2019s demands are $5 million and an apology. It's clear the latter means more to him than the money. The tragedy in \u201cDead Man's Wire\u201d is just how elusive \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d can be.",

      "Since Prime Video started to be the exclusive home of \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d in 2022, the audience has increased 60%. The first season averaged 9.58 million as audiences had to adjust to a regular package of games moving to a streaming service.",

      "Can they do it again",
      "When we first glimpse Noah Wyle\u2019s Michael Robinavitch \u2014 aka Dr. Robby, of course \u2014 in Season 2 of \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d he\u2019s looking darned good, truth be told. The beloved ER doc is riding his motorcycle to work, wearing nice shades, hair rustling in the early-morning Pittsburgh breeze.",
      "Wait \u2014 hair rustling? It\u2019s only then we notice what\u2019s missing. Can it be that Robby \u2014 dedicated, wise, overworked, charming and brilliant \u2014 isn\u2019t wearing a helmet?",
      "It\u2019s such a jarring sight that, launching a Zoom interview with Wyle, it\u2019s one of the first things we must inquire about. Did we remember that right? Were we supposed to notice?",
      "Yes and yes. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to notice that he doesn\u2019t wear it,\u201d Wyle confirms. \u201cBut then, he tells people that he does. Which means, you know he\u2019s lying. We don\u2019t know what else he\u2019s lying about.\u201d",
      "More broadly, it\u2019s all part of the goal this new season, after an impactful, Emmy-winning debut that culminated with a mass shooting. There were worries that they wouldn\u2019t be able to up the ante. Well, the idea is not to up the ante, Wyle says, but to more deeply explore characters and their issues.",
      "\u201cOur job isn't to come up with another stunt that creates drama to be the catalyst for excitement on the show,\u201d Wyle says. \u201cOur job is to be faithful to the characters that we\u2019ve initiated. To plot them in space and time in a real three-dimensional way, and allow their lives and what they\u2019re going through to generate the drama and the tension.\u201d",
      "Hence the no-helmet scene \u2014 a last-minute decision the night before. They'd planned for Robby to wear a helmet. But Wyle says he suggested to executive producer John Wells that if he didn\u2019t, \u201cWe won\u2019t know what to trust and what not to trust from that moment forward, and the audience will be privy to a secret that the characters around him aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe dug it, so we went with that.\u201d",
      "The timing \u2013 July 4 \u2013 was hardly chosen haphazardly. Think holiday gatherings, fireworks, injuries we can imagine and worse ones we can\u2019t. But also, timing is important for the characters \u2014 it's been 10 months since last season's events.",
      "Dr. Frank Langdon has spent those months in rehab. The hard-driving senior resident with the much-noticed dimpled chin ran into serious trouble in the first season when he was caught stealing prescription meds to feed his addiction.",
      "Well, Frank\u2019s been given a reprieve, and he\u2019s on his first day back. Robby, for one, is not thrilled.",
      "But Patrick Ball, who plays Frank, is very relieved at his own reprieve. He'd been biting his nails as he awaited his character\u2019s fate.",
      "\u201cPretty much the entirety of my time on \u2018The Pitt\u2019 has been praying for a job and hoping I don\u2019t get fired,\u201d Ball quips. \u201cI was sweating pretty hard.\u201d He got the good news that he'd be back in a call from Wells, while walking on a rainy New York street.",
      "Katherine LaNasa, who plays all-knowing charge nurse Dana, had a similar sense of uncertainty. She was a breakout star of the first season, winning one of the show\u2019s five Emmys. But her character also seemed headed out the door, disillusioned by a brutal punch from an unruly patient.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, really, please don\u2019t get rid of me now!\u201d LaNasa says she thought. Happily, Dana too is back, taking charge as her title implies, with that sassy but maternal demeanor.",
      "\u201cI think of her as like a basketball coach,\u201d says LaNasa of Dana. \u201cShe\u2019s looking at what\u2019s going on, and what do people need to do their best? \u2026 I have children that are 24 years apart in age and so, I feel like I\u2019ve just been mothering my whole life.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe\u2019s been the toughest nut to crack,\u201d Glaser, who's hosting Sunday's Globes, said Tuesday with a determined laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to crack it.\u201d",
      "The comedian got the hosting gig last year after showing her skill at ruthlessly roasting celebrities. She got raves for her monologue. She brought out the knives, but they weren\u2019t overly sharp. She was promptly asked back.",
      "Sunday's monologue will be a shape-shifting monster until the moment the CBS telecast starts and she takes the stage at the Beverly Hilton, ideally with a bit ready for Roberts, who's nominated for best actress in a drama for \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d She'll be sitting in front of Glaser with her star-powered charm.",
      "\u201cI just want to do the perfect joke but it\u2019s like people do not have a sense of humor about Julia Roberts,\u201d Glaser said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine \u2014 other people are not fine on her behalf. Like the most innocent joke about her that I made a couple times trying it out, they booed, they were like jeering.\u201d",
      "For others, Glaser is confident in her material, and their ability to take it, including the men in the absurdly star-studded best actor categories:",
      "\u2014 She\u2019ll get another shot at Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, nominated last year for playing Bob Dylan and this year for \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d: \u201cTimoth\u00e9e, he\u2019s great.

In 1980, he rose to fame for his lead role in Lee Jang-ho\u2019s \u201cGood, Windy Days,\u201d a hit coming-of-age movie about the struggle of working-class men from rural areas during the country\u2019s rapid rise and transition. Ahn won the best new actor award in the prestigious Grand Bell Awards, the Korean version of the Academy Awards.",

      "Ahn built up an image as a humble, trustworthy and family-oriented celebrity who avoided major scandals and maintained a quiet, stable personal life. Past public surveys chose Ahn as South Korea\u2019s most beloved actor and deserving of the nickname \u201cThe Nation\u2019s Actor.\u201d",
      "Ahn said he earlier felt confined with his \u201cThe Nation's Actor\u201d labeling but eventually thought that led him down the right path. \u201cI felt I should do something that could match that title. But I think that has eventually guided me in a good direction,\u201d Ahn said in an interview with Yonhap news agency in 2023.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t do well on acting like looking at someone who I don\u2019t love with loving eyes and kissing really romantically. I feel shy and can\u2019t express such emotions well,\u201d Ahn said in an interview with the Shindonga magazine in 2007. \u201cSimply, I\u2019m clumsy on that. So I couldn\u2019t star in such movies a lot. But ultimately, that was a right choice for me.\u201d",

      "The House is pushing ahead with legislation to renew subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans",
      "WASHINGTON -- Overpowering Speaker Mike Johnson, a bipartisan coalition in the House voted Wednesday to push forward a measure that would revive an enhanced pandemic-era subsidy that lowered health insurance costs for roughly 22 million people, but that had expired last month.",
      "The tally of 221-205 was a key test before passage of the bill, which is expected Thursday. And it came about because four GOP centrist lawmakers joined with Democrats in signing a so-called discharge petition to force the vote. After last year's government shutdown failed to resolve the issue, they said doing nothing was not an option as many of their constituents faced soaring health insurance premiums beginning this month.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, one of the Republicans who crossed party lines to back the Democratic proposal, portrayed it as a vehicle senators could use to reach a compromise.",
      "\u201cNo matter the issue, if the House puts forward relatively strong, bipartisan support, it makes it easier for the senators to get there,\u201d Lawler said.",
      "In the end, nine Republicans joined Democrats to advance the measure.",
      "If ultimately successful in the House this week, the voting would show there is bipartisan support for a proposed three-year extension of the tax credits that are available for those who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The action of forcing a vote has been an affront to Johnson and GOP leaders, who essentially lost control of their House majority as the renegade lawmakers joined Democrats for the workaround.",
      "But the Senate is under no requirement to take up the bill.",
      "Instead, a small group of members from both parties is working on an alternative plan that could find support in both chambers and become law. One proposal would be to shorten the extension of the subsidy to two years and make changes to the program.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said any plan passing muster in the Senate will need to have income limits to ensure that it's focused on those who most need the help and that beneficiaries would have to at least pay a nominal amount for their coverage.",

      "It's unclear whether the negotiations will yield a bill that the Senate will take up. Democrats are making clear that the higher health insurance costs many Americans are facing will be a political centerpiece of their efforts to retake the majority in the House and Senate in the fall elections.",

Brian Fitzpatrick, Robert Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie, all from Pennsylvania, and Lawler signed the Democrats' petition, pushing it to the magic number of 218 needed to force a House vote. All four represent key swing districts whose races will help determine which party takes charge of the House next year.",
      "Johnson, R-La., had discussed allowing more politically vulnerable GOP lawmakers a chance to vote on bills that would temporarily extend the subsidies while also adding changes such as income caps for beneficiaries. But after days of discussions, the leadership sided with the more conservative wing of the party\u2019s conference, which has assailed the subsidies as propping up a failed program.",

      "\u2014 PCV or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",

They said there was no new science that warranted the changes, including no signs that the former U.S. vaccine schedule harmed children.",
      "Dr. Sean O'Leary of the AAP said the changes could increase child illness and death from preventable disease. He voiced special concern that the U.S. would no longer recommend flu vaccine for children, just as the flu season is becoming severe and after last winter's particularly harsh season.",
      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own child vaccine recommendations. Also, states, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "It's not yet clear. Because of the countering recommendations from pediatricians, doctor visits may not change. However, medical specialists say when the U.S. government doesn't explicitly recommend a shot, it will raise questions among parents, leading to more difficult conversations at the doctor's office.",
      "If the changes mean fewer children are vaccinated, outbreaks that have historically been prevented by high vaccination rates could spread more widely, leading to more disease and more missed school and work.",
      "The Trump administration said coverage will continue for families that still want the shots. Health insurers generally find vaccination a good deal, as shots are cheaper than hospitalizations, and many had previously said they'd planned to cover what was recommended last year through 2026.",

      "The U.S. has taken the unprecedented step of dropping the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups say would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of cutting the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases.",
      "The change is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases. What's no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high risk, or when doctors recommend them in what's called \u201cshared decision-making.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won't result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the decision creates confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.",
      "States, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "The change comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",
      "\u201cThis decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Monday.",
      "Trump, reacting to the news on his Truth Social platform, said the new schedule is \u201cfar more reasonable\u201d and \u201cfinally aligns the United States with other Developed Nations around the World.\u201d",
      "Among those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are vaccines against measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and human papillomavirus, or HPV. The guidance reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against HPV from two or three shots depending on age to one for most children.",
      "Medical experts said Monday's changes without what they said was public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.",
      "\u201cAbandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\u201d said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just copy and paste public health and that\u2019s what they seem to be doing here,\u201d said O\u2019Leary. \u201cLiterally children's health and children's lives are at stake.\u201d",
      "Most high-income countries recommend vaccinations against a dozen to 15 serious pathogens, according to a recent review by the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group that works to safeguard vaccine use.",
      "France today recommends all children get vaccinated against 14 diseases, compared to the 11 that the U.S. now will recommend for every child under the new schedule.",

      "The changes were made by political appointees, without any evidence that the current recommendations were harming children, O'Leary said.",
      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own childhood vaccine schedule that its members are following, and it continues to broadly recommend vaccines that the Trump administration demoted.",
      "O'Leary singled out the flu vaccine, which the government and leading medical experts have long urged for nearly everyone starting at age 6 months. He said the government is \u201cpretty tone deaf\u201d for ending its recommendation while the country is at the beginning of a severe flu season, and after 280 children died from flu last winter, the most since 2009.",
      "Even a disease that parents may not have heard of, rotavirus, could come roaring back if vaccination erodes, he added. That diarrheal disease once hospitalized thousands of children each winter, something that no longer happens.",
      "The decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.",
      "The officials added that the new recommendations were a collaborative effort between federal health agencies but wouldn\u2019t specify who was consulted.",
      "Scientists at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases were asked to present to the agency\u2019s political leadership about vaccine schedules in other countries in December, but they were not allowed to give any recommendations and were not aware of any decisions about vaccine schedule changes, said Abby Tighe, executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, an advocacy organization of current and former CDC employees and their supporters.",
      "\u201cChanges of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, of the American Medical Association. \u201cThe scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies.\u201d",
      "The move comes as Kennedy, a longtime activist against vaccines, has repeatedly used his authority in government to translate his skepticism about the shots into national guidance.",
      "In May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women \u2014 a move immediately questioned by public health experts who saw no new data to justify the change.",
      "In June, Kennedy fired an entire 17-member CDC vaccine advisory committee \u2014 later installing several of his own replacements, including multiple vaccine skeptics.",
      "Kennedy in November also personally directed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying any new evidence to support the change.",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cThat is frightening,\u201d said Munodawafa. \u201cFor such a small population, those numbers are alarming.\u201d",

      "Zimbabwe's crisis mirrors a wider African pattern. Road accidents here kill about 300,000 people annually, about a quarter of the global toll. The continent has the world\u2019s highest fatality rate at 26.6 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with a global average of about 18, according to the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa. This is despite the continent of 1.5 billion people accounting for just about 3% of the global vehicle population.",
      "Road traffic deaths in Africa are also rising quicker than in any other region, with fatalities jumping 17% between 2010 and 2021, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s latest Africa road safety report released in mid-2024.",
      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",
      "In Uganda, where unregulated motorcycles dominate transport, reckless overtaking and speeding caused 44.5% of crashes in 2024, police there say, while in neighboring Kenya and across East Africa, frequent accidents on poor roads and dangerous driving fuel repeated calls for tougher road safety rules.",
      "To increase road safety, police in Zimbabwe have recently acquired body cameras and breathalyzers and are pushing for a review of the driver licensing system, including docking points for offenders and a revamp of driver training programs to highlight the dangers of reckless driving.",
      "\u201cDrivers are not licensed to be killers, they are licensed to practice road safety and safeguard lives on the road but sadly that is not the case,\u201d said police spokesperson Paul Nyathi.",
      "For instructors like Muvhevhi, survival has become the lesson.",
      "\u201cWhen we are teaching our students, it\u2019s no longer an issue of just obtaining the driver\u2019s license,\u201d he said. \u201cWe teach them to stay alive in spite of incorrect actions of other road users.\u201d",

      "During President Claudia Sheinbaum's daily news conference, officials said Mexico recorded 17.5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2025, the lowest rate since 2016.",
      "That compares with 29 killings per 100,000 people in 2018, when homicides reached their highest level in two decades.",
      "Sheinbaum, of the leftist Morena party, said homicides dropped 40% between September 2024 \u2014 the month before she took office \u2014 and December 2025.",
      "\u201cThis means 34 fewer homicides every day, and it is the lowest figure since 2016,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "She attributed the decline to a strategy based on coordination among security forces, justice institutions, prosecutors\u2019 offices and state governors.",
      "However, Mexico's public security secretariat has not yet published data of the whole 2025 homicide figures and neither has the Statistics Institute, which releases data annually that is considered more reliable because it is based on death certificates but is published after a monthslong delay.",
      "Mexico\u2019s homicide rate began rising sharply in 2006, following the launch of a military-led campaign against drug cartels under then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n of the conservative PAN party.",

      "After taking office on Oct. 1, 2024, Sheinbaum hardened the government\u2019s security approach amid pressure from the United States, moving away from L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d policy and prioritizing intelligence work and interagency coordination.",
      "Lisa S\u00e1nchez, director of the nongovernmental organization Mexico United Against Crime, said homicides are down, but she cautioned that not all of the necessary data is available to make meaningful comparisons. \u201cWe don't know how they're compiled and handled,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Spain\u2019s government and the country\u2019s Catholic bishops have agreed to a joint plan to compensate victims of sexual abuse by clergy members who have died or whose possible crimes have been proscribed",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Spain's government and the country's Catholic bishops agreed Thursday to a joint plan to compensate victims of sexual abuse by clergy members who have died or whose possible crimes have been proscribed.",
      "The agreement aimed to resolve discrepancies between the left-wing government and church authorities over the question of reparations for abuse victims in the once staunchly Catholic country, which has secularized in recent decades.",
      "The Spanish Episcopal Conference, run by the bishops, said in a statement that the new agreement will allow victims who don\u2019t want to seek help directly from the church to turn to the government and the state\u2019s ombudsman, who has taken a lead role in shedding light on abuse.",
      "Spain\u2019s Justice Minister F\u00e9lix Bola\u00f1os said in a press conference in Madrid that \u201chundreds\u201d of victims whose aggressors had passed away or were now very old could finally receive recognition of the abuse and receive economic reparations paid by the church.",
      "\u201cToday, we have paid a debt to the victims,\u201d Bola\u00f1os said. \u201cIt is true that the State has acted late, but we are acting now. Yesterday, the victims couldn\u2019t do anything because these crimes had proscribed.\u201d",
      "Only in the past decade has Spain begun to face the question of sexual abuse by the priesthood and other church members, mainly thanks to the initial reporting by newspaper El Pa\u00eds.",
      "In 2023, Spain\u2019s ombudsman delivered a damning 800-page report that investigated 487 known cases of sexual abuse and included a survey that calculated the number of possible victims could reach the hundreds of thousands.",
      "Spain\u2019s bishops strongly refuted that estimate by the ombudsman, saying its own investigation had uncovered 728 sexual abusers within the church since 1945. It said that most of the crimes had occurred before 1990 and that 60% of the aggressors were now dead.",
      "In 2024, the government announced its intention to force the church to compensate victims. That was followed a few months later by the bishops saying they were creating a special committee to hear from victims, assess their claims and ensure their \u201ceconomic, spiritual and psychological\u201d reparation.",
      "But victims' groups were critical of the bishops' plan since it relied on them approaching the church and had no outside oversight.",
      "On Thursday, Archbishop Luis Arg\u00fcello, the president of the Spanish Episcopal Conference, acknowledged that some victims did not feel comfortable approaching the church offices.",
      "Now, victims can turn to the government instead.",

      "Under the new agreement, victims can approach Spain's Justice Ministry with their initial petition. The ministry will pass it on to the ombudsman, who will study it and propose a compensation package that the church\u2019s committee will then assess. If no agreement can be reached with the church and the victim, the case will go to a joint committee with representatives of the church, the ombudsman's office and victims' associations. If that committee can\u2019t agree, the ombudsman's decision will stand, Bola\u00f1os said.",
      "The window for filing claims will be open for one year. After that, the agreement can be extended for an additional year if needed, according to Bola\u00f1os.",
      "In addition to victims' groups and the Spanish bishops, Bola\u00f1os thanked the work of late Pope Francis and Pope Leo XIV in uncovering abuse in the church.",
      "Arg\u00fcello said the church had already paid out 2 million euros ($2.3 million) in compensation after taking up petitions by more than a hundred victims since its special committee opened in 2024.",
      "Payments to victims will be free of taxes in the new deal.",
      "Only a handful of countries have had government-initiated or parliamentary inquiries into clergy sex abuse, although some independent groups have carried out their own investigations.",
      "The issue of compensating victims of abuse has long vexed the church, with wide disparities in programs and payouts around the world. In the United States, where the abuse scandal erupted in 2002, litigation, settlements and abuse compensation programs have cost the church billions of dollars and led several dioceses to seek bankruptcy protection.",
      "Elsewhere, church-run compensation programs have awarded smaller amounts to victims and paired financial reparations with services offering therapy and spiritual assistance. The French church, for example, paid out an average of about 35,000 euros ($41,000) to each of the 358 victims whose claims were received in 2023. Compensation awards were approved in 2024 for another 489 people, 88 of whom were given the maximum 60,000 euro ($70,000) claim, the church reported.",
      "The Vatican\u2019s child protection advisory board said in its report last year that the Catholic Church had a moral obligation to help victims heal, and that financial reparations for the abused, and tougher sanctions for the abusers and their enablers were essential remedies.",

      "Protests in Iran, driven by economic issues, have spread nationwide, challenging the country's theocracy",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Protests in Iran sparked by economic woes have now gone nationwide in the Islamic Republic, activists said Thursday, signaling both their staying power and intensity as they challenge the country's theocracy.",
      "Wednesday saw the most-intense day of demonstrations, reaching rural towns and major cities in every province though still localized enough for daily life to continue in Tehran, Iran's capital, and elsewhere. So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 38 people while more than 2,200 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "The growth of the protests increases the pressure on Iran's civilian government and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So far, authorities haven't shut down the internet or fully flooded the streets with security forces like they did to put down the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations. But any intensification may seem them act.",
      "Meanwhile, the protests themselves have remained broadly leaderless, though a call for protests by Iran's exiled crown prince will test whether or not demonstrators are being swayed by messages from abroad.",
      "\u201cThe lack of a viable alternative has undermined past protests in Iran,\u201d wrote Nate Swanson of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, who studies Iran.",
      "\u201cThere may be a thousand Iranian dissident activists who, given a chance, could emerge as respected statesmen, as labor leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa did in Poland at the end of the Cold War. But so far, the Iranian security apparatus has arrested, persecuted and exiled all of the country\u2019s potential transformational leaders.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, at least 37 protests took place across the country, activists said. They included Shiraz, where online videos purported to show an anti-riot truck using a water cannon to target demonstrators. The state-run IRNA news agency, which has largely been silent about the demonstrations, reported on a mass demonstration in Bojnourd, as well as demonstrations in Kerman and Kermanshah.",
      "Iranian officials have offered no acknowledgment of the scale of the protests. However, there has been reporting regarding security officials being hurt or killed. The judiciary's Mizan news agency report a police colonel suffered fatal stab wounds in a town outside of Tehran, while the semiofficial Fars news agency said gunmen killed two security force members and wounded 30 others in a shooting in the city of Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province.",
      "Demonstrations continued Thursday, with merchants closing their shops in Iran\u2019s Kurdistan province.",
      "It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s warned last week that if Tehran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters,\u201d America \u201cwill come to their rescue.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments drew a new rebuke from Iran's Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cRecalling the long history of criminal interventions by successive U.S. administrations in Iran\u2019s internal affairs, the Foreign Ministry considers claims of concern for the great Iranian nation to be hypocritical, aimed at deceiving public opinion and covering up the numerous crimes committed against Iranians,\u201d it said.",

      "But those comments haven't stopped the U.S. State Department on the social platform X from highlighting online footage purporting to show demonstrators putting up stickers naming roads after Trump or throwing away government-subsidized rice.",
      "\u201cWhen prices are set so high that neither consumers can afford to buy nor farmers can afford to sell, everyone loses,\u201d the State Department said in one message. \u201cIt makes no difference if this rice is thrown away.\u201d",
      "The demonstrations so far broadly appear to be leaderless, like other rounds of protests in Iran in recent years. However, Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah, has urged the public in Iran to shout from their windows and roofs on Thursday and Friday nights at 8 p.m. (1630 GMT).",
      "\u201cWherever you are, whether in the streets or even from your own homes, I call on you to begin chanting exactly at this time,\u201d Pahlavi said in an online video that's also been promoted by Iranian satellite news channels abroad. \u201cBased on your response, I will announce the next calls to action.\u201d",
      "Whether people take part will be a sign of possible support for Pahlavi, whose support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past \u2014 particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi remains imprisoned by authorities after her arrest in December.",
      "\u201cSince Dec. 28, 2025, the people of Iran have taken to the streets, just as they did in 2009, 2019,\u201d her son Ali Rahmani said. \u201cEach time, the same demands came up: an end to the Islamic Republic, an end to this patriarchal, dictatorial and religious regime, the end of the clerics, the end of the mullahs' regime.\u201d",
      "Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel in June, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran\u2019s theocracy.",
      "Prior to Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials. Shops in markets across the country have shut down as part of the protests.",
      "This round of protests has yet to reach the level of the months of protests surrounding the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022. Amini was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities. Her death became a rallying cry for women who continue to refuse to wear the hijab.",

      "China and Japan \u2014 frenemies, trading partners and uneasy neighbors with a tortured, bloody history they still struggle to navigate \u2014 are freshly at each other\u2019s rhetorical throats as 2026 begins. And it\u2019s over the same sticking points that have kept them resentful and suspicious for many decades: Japan\u2019s occupation of parts of China in the 20th century, the use of military power in East Asia, economics and politics \u2014 and, of course, pride.",
      "From insinuations that Chinese citizens face dangers in Japan to outright accusations of resurgent Japanese imperialism, this first week of the year in China has been marked by the communist government scorning Tokyo on multiple fronts and noticeably embracing the visiting leader of another crucial strategic neighbor: South Korea.",
      "The latest chapter in Japan-China enmity surged In November when Japan's new leader waded into choppy bilateral waters. She said, in effect, that if China moved militarily against Taiwan, she wouldn't rule out involving Japan's constitutionally defense-only military. That didn't go over well in Beijing, which has teed off on Tokyo over the years for far less.",
      "\u201cPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s erroneous remarks concerning Taiwan infringe upon China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, blatantly interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, and send a military threat against China,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday, a week after military exercises around the island ended. \u201cWe urge Japan to face up to the root causes of the issue, reflect and correct its mistakes.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s hardly uncommon language. China frequently demands Japan ponder the path it has taken and correct its \u201cerroneous\u201d course. It's rhetoric, sure, but it goes far deeper. And sometimes it's hard to tell what's real umbrage and what's ginned up for domestic political consumption.",
      "Because when it comes to the China-Japan relationship, anger remains a powerful and enduring tool on both sides. And there's no indication that's going away anytime soon.",
      "From the time Japan colonized Taiwan in 1895 after a war with Qing Dynasty China, a deep suspicion and at times outright enmity has existed between the two countries.",
      "It worsened in the 1920s and 1930s after Japan\u2019s brutal occupation of parts of China resulted in torture and deaths that Chinese resent to this day. At the same time, Japanese leaders have sometimes thrown incendiary political footballs like visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japanese who gave their lives in the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 including some war criminals from the Sino-Japanese wars. China, like clockwork, responds with indignation.",
      "Japan lost World War II to the Allied powers and relinquished offensive military powers under a U.S.-drafted constitution, even as the current communist Chinese government was establishing the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. Since then, any hint of Japanese military assertiveness has drawn great umbrage here. Disputes over territory, such as an island chain called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, spike occasionally.",
      "The enmity, pulled out when something is perceived as aggressive or anger is required for a domestic audience, lurks barely beneath the surface, ready to pop. Even today, cartoons circulate online in China depicting Japanese as demonic, aggressive and anti-China.",
      "This week has been an illuminating case study.",
      "On Tuesday, China slapped restrictions on \u201cdual-use exports\u201d to Japan \u2014 anything, it said, that Japan could adapt for military use. Though it didn't specify what the ban includes, anything from drones to rare earths could be considered dual-use. The lack of specificity allows China to adjust its approach as it goes \u2014 making it more or less strict depending on where the political winds are blowing.",
      "Japan demanded the move be rescinded. \u201cThese measures, which only target Japan, deviate significantly from international practice,\u201d its Foreign Ministry said, calling China's actions \u201cabsolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable.\u201d This came days after it protested Chinese mobile drilling rigs in the East China Sea.",

      "\u201cJapan has never been able to fully eliminate the scourge of militarism in the country,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf Japan's right-wing forces are left free to develop powerful offensive weapons, or even possess nuclear weapons, it will again bring disaster to the world.\u201d",

      "The commission will investigate the nature, prevalence and drivers of antisemitism generally as well as the circumstances of the Bondi mass shooting, Albanese told reporters in Canberra on Thursday. It will also make recommendations for law enforcement, strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of extremism.",

      "\u201cThis was an antisemitic terrorist attack, aimed at Jewish Australians, inspired by ISIS, the deadliest that has ever occurred on Australian soil,\" said Albanese, referring to the Islamic State group.

      "Saudi Arabia alleges the United Arab Emirates smuggled a wanted separatist leader out of Yemen",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia alleged Thursday that the United Arab Emirates smuggled a separatist leader in Yemen wanted for treason out of the country and flew him to Abu Dhabi.",
      "The UAE had no immediate reaction to the claim, which further escalates tensions between the neighboring nations on the Arabian Peninsula as their partnership in the yearslong war in Yemen breaks down.",
      "A Saudi military statement claimed Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of the Southern Transitional Council, fled Yemen by boat to Somalia. Then, UAE officials flew al-Zubaidi to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the Emirates, the statement said. The UAE has been the major supporter of the council, known as the STC, which sparked a confrontation between Saudi Arabia and the Emirates in recent days after STC fighters advanced in two governorates and appeared to be preparing to secede from Yemen.",
      "The Saudi statement from Maj. Gen. Turki al-Malki included him naming a major general in the UAE as being involved in al-Zubaidi's alleged escape, along with identifying his nom de guerre \u2014 something highly unusual in the typical clubby world of Gulf Arab relations. It also suggested an Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft used in the operation had been used in \u201cconflict zones\u201d like Ethiopia, Libya and Somalia \u2014 routes the Emirati military has been accused of funneling weapons through in the past.",
      "The UAE has denied running guns into those areas. The Emirati Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. The STC did not immediately acknowledge the allegation either, saying Wednesday that al-Zubaidi had remained in Aden, where forces allied against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels had congregated for years since the rebels seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa.",
      "Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed al-Jaber, said on X Thursday morning that he met with the STC delegation that landed in Riyadh a day earlier. They discussed al-Zubaidi's recent actions, which he said \u201charmed the southern cause and didn't serve it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe also explored ways to work in the future to address what happened in a manner that serves the Southern cause, the Coalition\u2019s efforts to achieve security and stability in Yemen, and we addressed the arrangements for the Southern Cause Conference, which will be held in Riyadh soon,\u201d he added.",
      "Meanwhile, Mohamed al-Ghaithi, an STC member and head of the negotiation and reconciliation committee supporting the Presidential Leadership Council, called the meeting with al-Jaber \u201cfruitful\" and praised the kingdom's initiative to sponsor the conference aimed at finding a resolution in the south. Al-Ghaithi confirmed that the delegation \u201crejected everything that harms unity.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have heard clear commitments from our brothers in Riyadh towards our people\u2019s cause and ensuring a secure and stable future,\u201d he added in a post on X. On Wednesday, the STC had said it lost contact with it's delegation after they landed in Riyadh, with a Council representative saying that members' cellphones were either switched off or ringing with no one answering.",
      "Southern Yemen had been run under the Presidential Leadership Council, a group including al-Zubaidi and others, since 2022. On Wednesday, the leadership council expelled al-Zubaidi and charged him with treason after he apparently declined to fly to Saudi Arabia for talks. It marked the latest pushback against the STC by Saudi Arabia, which also recently launched airstrikes against the group and an arms shipment the kingdom said came from the UAE.",
      "The war in Yemen, on the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula and bordering the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians. It has created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters. The Houthis have also launched attacks against shipping over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, disrupting a vital route for global commerce.",

      "Authorities in the city of Catania have suspended or restricted excursions to see the volcano's lava flows, prompting guides to go on strike for the first time in decades and leaving disgruntled tourists with fewer options to see the spectacle up close.",
      "Dozens of the guides demonstrated Wednesday in front of Mount Etna\u2019s lava flow gate, calling the new restrictions excessive and saying the lava flows are slow-moving enough to be viewed safely as has been done in the past.",
      "\u201cThese measures effectively nullify the role of guides, stripping them of their skills, function, and professional responsibility,\u201d a statement by the guides\u2019 regional board said.",
      "The lava flows are especially spectacular after sunset, but under the new rules, excursions are allowed only until dusk and can go no closer than 200 meters (660 feet) to the lava flow. Also, a previously existing limit of 10 people per group is being vigorously enforced, including with drones.",

      "The latest restrictions were adopted after Mount Etna started a round of eruptions on Christmas Eve.",

      "Russell Shoup, who is assistant commissioner of Tennessee's Driver Services Division, said the state is working to make sure all the licenses the state has issued meet current state and federal standards.",
      "The federal crackdown on commercial driver's licensing has been praised by trucking groups. The industry said that too often unqualified drivers who shouldn\u2019t have licenses or can\u2019t speak English have been allowed to get behind the wheel of an 80,000-pound (about 39,916 kilograms) truck. They have also applauded the Transportation Department\u2019s moves to go after questionable commercial driver\u2019s license schools.",
      "But immigrant groups say that some drivers are now being unfairly targeted. The spotlight has been on Sikh truckers because the driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs. So the Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit against California over that state's plan to revoke thousands of licenses.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but these non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver\u2019s licenses or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",

      "The Congressional Budget Office has released new economic projections, expecting the Federal Reserve to cut short-term rates in 2026",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term rates in 2026, with its key interest rate settling at 3.4% towards the end of President Donald Trump 's term in office in 2028, according to a new report released Thursday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Despite the Fed's cuts, however, the budget office projects the yield on 10-year Treasury notes to increase gradually, from 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2028. The 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark for mortgage rates, so the forecast suggests mortgage borrowing could get more expensive over the next two years.",
      "The CBO on Thursday released new economic projections for the next three years, taking into account Trump\u2019s tariffs, immigration policies and last year\u2019s federal government shutdown, among other factors.",
      "\u201cTogether, those adjustments affected the near-term path of GDP, employment, and inflation but did not materially change the overall economic outlook through 2028,\u201d the report states.",
      "Jobless rates are expected to increase before they improve over the next two years, the report states.",
      "The CBO expects the unemployment rate to peak at 4.6% in 2026 but then ease to 4.4% in 2028 \u2014 affected largely by the impacts of Trump\u2019s tax and spending law, passed by Congress and signed in July, as well as fewer migrants in the country.",
      "Also, the budget office projects that real gross domestic product growth is expected to rise to 2.2% in 2026, supported by the tax and spending law and a rebound from the late-2025 shutdown. GDP growth is then set to slow to an average of 1.8% in 2027 and 2028 as fiscal support wanes and labor force growth slows. The forecasts are similar to those made by the Federal Reserve, though the Fed expects growth will reach 2% in 2027 and 1.9% in 2028.",

      "Experts say more consumers are seeking toilet paper made from recycled content or sustainable materials, but it can be hard to know what to look for.",
      "Sustainable toilet paper often costs more, but can have significant environmental benefits. According to the Environmental Paper Network, a coalition of nonprofits, more than 1 billion gallons (3.8 billion liters) of water and 1.6 million trees could be saved if every American used one roll of toilet paper made from recycled content instead of a roll made from forest fibers.",
      "Here are some recommendations for buying sustainable toilet paper or reducing overall toilet paper use.",
      "North American toilet paper has traditionally been made from fibers from trees in Canada and eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. Pulp made from the trees is bleached to create a bright white color, but the chlorine that's often used can hurt the environment. Large amounts of electricity and heat are used to remove moisture and form square sheets.",
      "Increasingly, manufacturers are making toilet paper from recycled paper products, which avoids material from freshly cut trees, and are using chlorine-free bleaching techniques. Once used, toilet paper itself is flushed and not recycled.",
      "Looking for recycled content is a good place for environmentally conscious consumers to start, said Gary Bull, professor emeritus of forest economics at the University of British Columbia. Preconsumer materials include scrap materials from manufacturing or unsold paper. Postconsumer materials come from paper products that have already been used.",
      "Making toilet paper from postconsumer recycled fibers improves its sustainability because paper is \u201cone of the easiest materials on the planet to recycle,\u201d Bull said.",
      "The best way for a scientist to evaluate the carbon footprint of an item is doing a life cycle assessment, which calculates the environmental impacts from when a tree is a seedling to when its fibers are converted into toilet paper and flushed down the drain, Bull said. But that method isn't within reach of consumers, so advocates have undertaken third-party assessments.",
      "Some companies add those labels to packaging to show that their processes have been vetted. Bull said labels on bath tissue from the Forest Stewardship Council or the Sustainable Forestry Initiative indicate the company is making scientifically-proven efforts to be sustainable. Both groups' standards include conserving water, wildlife, and biodiversity as well as compliance with applicable forestry laws to keep ecosystems healthy.",
      "The nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council also publishes an annual report that grades toilet papers from A+ to F, with the highest-ranked products being unbleached or bleached without chlorine, containing recycled content and avoiding harmful forestry practices. Aria, Green Forest, Natural Value, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods 365 100% Recycled received the highest letter grade in 2025, with all made entirely from recycled materials.",

      "Mark Pitts, executive director of tissue at the American Forest & Paper Association, whose members include large toilet paper manufacturers such as Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Georgia-Pacific, told The Associated Press that sustainability is a core industry focus and members have reported reductions of greenhouse gas emissions along the supply chain. He said that members follow responsible forestry practices and have increased their use of recycled material.",
      "Alternative materials such as fast-growing bamboo are often billed as more sustainable than toilet paper made from trees, but consumers should focus on toilet paper made with recycled materials instead, said Ronalds Gonzalez, an associate professor at North Carolina State University and expert on fibers used in the hygiene industry.",
      "Gonzalez said pollution from manufacturing processes can reduce the benefits of using bamboo. Gonzalez recently co-authored a study that found bamboo toilet paper made in China that is available in the U.S. had a higher environmental impact than toilet paper made in the U.S. with imported forest fibers, largely because Chinese manufacturers use electricity generated by coal. The study found the bamboo toilet paper\u2019s environmental impacts could be reduced when it was produced in regions that use renewable energy.",
      "Bidets are devices that allow people to rinse after using the bathroom so they can reduce or avoid wiping. They're another way people can reduce their toilet paper use.",
      "Bidets, which are popular in Europe, can be a separate wash basin or a device added to toilets that generate a stream of water. Some people still use a small amount of toilet paper to dry off. Bidets that can be attached to your toilet and don't use electricity can cost around $30, while toilet seats with fancy options such as heated water and air dryers can exceed $600. Some bidets require a plumber or contractor to install.",
      "Bidets are a sustainable alternative to conventional toilet paper because \u201cyou\u2019re not using any sort of logging, it\u2019s water that\u2019s already coming to your household and it\u2019s very little water,\u201d Russel said.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Protests in Iran sparked by economic woes have now gone nationwide in the Islamic Republic, activists said Thursday, signaling both their staying power and intensity as they challenge the country's theocracy.",
      "Wednesday saw the most-intense day of demonstrations, reaching rural towns and major cities in every province though still localized enough for daily life to continue in Tehran, Iran's capital, and elsewhere. So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 38 people while more than 2,200 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "The growth of the protests increases the pressure on Iran's civilian government and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So far, authorities haven't shut down the internet or fully flooded the streets with security forces like they did to put down the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations. But any intensification may seem them act.",
      "Meanwhile, the protests themselves have remained broadly leaderless, though a call for protests by Iran's exiled crown prince will test whether or not demonstrators are being swayed by messages from abroad.",
      "\u201cThe lack of a viable alternative has undermined past protests in Iran,\u201d wrote Nate Swanson of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, who studies Iran.",
      "\u201cThere may be a thousand Iranian dissident activists who, given a chance, could emerge as respected statesmen, as labor leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa did in Poland at the end of the Cold War. But so far, the Iranian security apparatus has arrested, persecuted and exiled all of the country\u2019s potential transformational leaders.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, at least 37 protests took place across the country, activists said. They included Shiraz, where online videos purported to show an anti-riot truck using a water cannon to target demonstrators. The state-run IRNA news agency, which has largely been silent about the demonstrations, reported on a mass demonstration in Bojnourd, as well as demonstrations in Kerman and Kermanshah.",
      "Iranian officials have offered no acknowledgment of the scale of the protests. However, there has been reporting regarding security officials being hurt or killed. The judiciary's Mizan news agency report a police colonel suffered fatal stab wounds in a town outside of Tehran, while the semiofficial Fars news agency said gunmen killed two security force members and wounded 30 others in a shooting in the city of Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province.",
      "Demonstrations continued Thursday, with merchants closing their shops in Iran\u2019s Kurdistan province.",
      "It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s warned last week that if Tehran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters,\u201d America \u201cwill come to their rescue.\u201d",

      "\u201cRecalling the long history of criminal interventions by successive U.S. administrations in Iran\u2019s internal affairs, the Foreign Ministry considers claims of concern for the great Iranian nation to be hypocritical, aimed at deceiving public opinion and covering up the numerous crimes committed against Iranians,\u201d it said.",

      "The demonstrations so far broadly appear to be leaderless, like other rounds of protests in Iran in recent years. However, Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah, has urged the public in Iran to shout from their windows and roofs on Thursday and Friday nights at 8 p.m. (1630 GMT).",
      "\u201cWherever you are, whether in the streets or even from your own homes, I call on you to begin chanting exactly at this time,\u201d Pahlavi said in an online video that's also been promoted by Iranian satellite news channels abroad. \u201cBased on your response, I will announce the next calls to action.\u201d",
      "Whether people take part will be a sign of possible support for Pahlavi, whose support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past \u2014 particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi remains imprisoned by authorities after her arrest in December.",
      "\u201cSince Dec. 28, 2025, the people of Iran have taken to the streets, just as they did in 2009, 2019,\u201d her son Ali Rahmani said. \u201cEach time, the same demands came up: an end to the Islamic Republic, an end to this patriarchal, dictatorial and religious regime, the end of the clerics, the end of the mullahs' regime.\u201d",
      "Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel in June, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran\u2019s theocracy.",
      "Prior to Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials. Shops in markets across the country have shut down as part of the protests.",
      "This round of protests has yet to reach the level of the months of protests surrounding the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022. Amini was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities. Her death became a rallying cry for women who continue to refuse to wear the hijab.",

      "From insinuations that Chinese citizens face dangers in Japan to outright accusations of resurgent Japanese imperialism, this first week of the year in China has been marked by the communist government scorning Tokyo on multiple fronts and noticeably embracing the visiting leader of another crucial strategic neighbor: South Korea.",

      "Because when it comes to the China-Japan relationship, anger remains a powerful and enduring tool on both sides. And there's no indication that's going away anytime soon.",
      "From the time Japan colonized Taiwan in 1895 after a war with Qing Dynasty China, a deep suspicion and at times outright enmity has existed between the two countries.",
      "It worsened in the 1920s and 1930s after Japan\u2019s brutal occupation of parts of China resulted in torture and deaths that Chinese resent to this day. At the same time, Japanese leaders have sometimes thrown incendiary political footballs like visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japanese who gave their lives in the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 including some war criminals from the Sino-Japanese wars. China, like clockwork, responds with indignation.",
      "Japan lost World War II to the Allied powers and relinquished offensive military powers under a U.S.-drafted constitution, even as the current communist Chinese government was establishing the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. Since then, any hint of Japanese military assertiveness has drawn great umbrage here. Disputes over territory, such as an island chain called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, spike occasionally.",
      "The enmity, pulled out when something is perceived as aggressive or anger is required for a domestic audience, lurks barely beneath the surface, ready to pop. Even today, cartoons circulate online in China depicting Japanese as demonic, aggressive and anti-China.",
      "This week has been an illuminating case study.",
      "On Tuesday, China slapped restrictions on \u201cdual-use exports\u201d to Japan \u2014 anything, it said, that Japan could adapt for military use. Though it didn't specify what the ban includes, anything from drones to rare earths could be considered dual-use. The lack of specificity allows China to adjust its approach as it goes \u2014 making it more or less strict depending on where the political winds are blowing.",
      "Japan demanded the move be rescinded. \u201cThese measures, which only target Japan, deviate significantly from international practice,\u201d its Foreign Ministry said, calling China's actions \u201cabsolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable.\u201d This came days after it protested Chinese mobile drilling rigs in the East China Sea.",

      "On Wednesday, the focus turned to a gas called dichlorosilane, used in computer chip manufacturing. The Commerce Ministry said it had launched an investigation into why the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024. \u201cThe dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,\u201d it said.",

      "\u201cJapan has never been able to fully eliminate the scourge of militarism in the country,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf Japan's right-wing forces are left free to develop powerful offensive weapons, or even possess nuclear weapons, it will again bring disaster to the world.\u201d",

      "State lawmakers and governors will have decisions to make in 2026 about the budgets for their biggest social safety net programs",
      "States have major decisions to make in 2026 about the social safety net and taxes in the aftermath of a sweeping law President Donald Trump signed last year.",
      "The federal government is shifting more responsibilities to states over the next few years, and states must prepare for greater costs in the Medicaid health care and SNAP food aid programs. They also must decide whether to offset upcoming federal funding cuts with state tax dollars. And they must weigh whether to cut state taxes on tips, overtime wages and other items to remain in line with Trump's big bill.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big storm coming for state budgets \u2014 the radar is clear \u2014 and it\u2019s going to hit almost every state,\u201d said Tim Storey, CEO of the National Conference of State Legislatures. \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean some hard choices.\u201d",

      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is used by 42 million Americans to help buy groceries, is going to become more expensive for states to run and harder for some people to qualify for assistance.",
      "Currently, the federal government picks up the full cost of benefits \u2014 around $94 billion in the fiscal year that ended in September 2024 \u2014 and splits the administrative costs with the states, which run the program. The federal share of administrative costs for 2024 was about $6 billion.",
      "Starting Oct. 1, states will have to pay three-fourths of the cost to run the program. And starting in late 2027, some states that make errors in more than 6% of payments \u2014 often for paying a household more than it's supposed to get after its income rises \u2014 will have to start paying some of the costs of benefits.",
      "California already has allocated $84 million to try to reduce SNAP errors, plus additional money to help counties implement other new requirements.",
      "The shift in administrative costs could come to around $50 million a year in Florida, said Sky Beard, the Florida director for No Kid Hungry. Paying for some SNAP benefits, if the state is forced to, could be in the neighborhood of $1 billion a year. She said that\u2019s a reason lawmakers have a lot of questions about the details of error rates.",
      "Other states are weighing whether to put more money into SNAP.",
      "New Jersey Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, a Democrat, said the state has an obligation to help people access health care and food. But he said the magnitude of federal cuts \u2014 as much as a $36 billion reduction for New Jersey over the next decade for Medicaid alone, according to KFF, an organization that researches health policy \u2014 could make it hard to keep all the state\u2019s social programs unchanged.",
      "\u201cWhat there will be is a commitment to doing our level best to make sure that all of the people\u2019s needs get covered,\u201d Coughlin said.",
      "The federal law signed by Trump imposes work requirements for some adults on Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. Most states must start those work mandates by January 2027, which means they must be accounted for in their next state budgets.",
      "But states can start sooner if they desire.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced that his state will launch Medicaid work requirements in May. The Republican said the state could handle the change without hiring more government employees and that the work mandate \u201ccan have a gigantic impact in helping lift people up.\u201d",

It's seeking more than $12 million to hire the equivalent of about 120 people to carry out the tasks.",

Forty states and the District of Columbia took up the offer. The states that didn't agree to the expansion all have legislatures controlled by Republicans.",

      "NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors slammed Luigi Mangione\u2019s lawyers on Wednesday for making what the government said were \"meritless\" and \"misleading\u201d claims about Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s ties to a lobbying firm and her decision to seek the death penalty in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Deputy Manhattan U.S. Attorney Sean Buckley wrote in a court filing that Mangione\u2019s lawyers wrongly claimed in a submission last month that Bondi, a former partner at Ballard Partners, was continuing to receive income through a profit-sharing arrangement with the firm, whose clients include UnitedHealthcare\u2019s parent company UnitedHealth Group.",
      "Bondi does have a 401(k) account through Ballard \u201creflecting past, fully earned compensation,\u201d but the firm agreed to stop making contributions when she left, Buckley wrote.",
      "\u201cThe defendant\u2019s narrative collapses under the weight of his own assumptions, because a financial conflict theory requires a demonstrable financial benefit tethered to the litigation,\u201d Buckley wrote. \u201cWhere no present or future financial gain exists, there is no conflict.\u201d",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyers argue that Bondi\u2019s past lobbying work and her subsequent role leading the charge to turn his federal prosecution into a capital case, have created a \u201cprofound conflict of interest\u201d that violated his due process rights. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. A hearing is scheduled for Friday.",
      "Buckley said Mangione\u2019s lawyers also misconstrued Bondi\u2019s pledge in a January 2025 letter that, as attorney general, she would follow ethical regulations and bow out of matters pertaining to Ballard clients for a year. In the letter, he said, Bondi made clear that she would not participate in \u201cany matter in which Ballard Partners, or a client of Ballard Partners was a party.\"",
      "Bondi had no \u201cethical, statutory, or constitutional obligation to recuse herself\u201d from Mangione\u2019s criminal case because Ballard and the UnitedHealth Group companies are not parties to it, Buckley wrote. \u201cAny collateral reputational or emotional interest those companies may have in the outcome does not transform them into parties or entities\u201d requiring her to step aside.",

    "story": [
      "Georgia is the latest state to consider eliminating its personal income tax, with Republican leaders in the Senate backing a proposal to phase it out by 2032",
      "ATLANTA -- Eliminating state income taxes sounds great to many voters, but Republicans backing the push in multiple states still face questions about whether such big tax cuts can be made without raising other taxes or sharply cutting state funding for education, health care and other services.",
      "Georgia on Wednesday became the latest state to launch a bid to abolish its personal income tax, with Republican leaders in the Senate backing a proposal to zero it out by 2032. This year, Georgia's personal income tax is projected to collect about $16.5 billion, or 44% of the state's general revenue.",
      "The push is driven by politics. Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, the Republican who leads the state Senate, has made eliminating income taxes a centerpiece of his 2026 campaign for governor. State Sen. Blake Tillery, a Vidalia Republican who led a committee to abolish the tax, is among candidates to succeed Jones as lieutenant governor.",
      "\u201cThis is the first vote that we are going to get to take to address affordability,\u201d Tillery said.",
      "But it's unclear if the proposal will pass. Georgia House Republicans may want to continue nibbling away at the tax in smaller bites, preferring a \u201cmeasured\u201d approach. Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington said Wednesday that his big 2026 goal is to eliminate property taxes for homeowners, but said he's willing to consider the Senate plan.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, serving his last year, has been cool to total elimination of the income tax. He declined to comment Wednesday on the Senate plan, but spokesperson Carter Chapman said Kemp wants \"to continue lowering taxes and putting more money in Georgians\u2019 pockets as he has throughout his term.\u201d",
      "The state's Democratic minority opposes the move, saying it would mostly benefit high earners and the state needs money to provide services.",
      "Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi and Missouri have all set goals to abolish the personal income tax, joining eight other states that don't tax personal income. Eight other states besides Georgia are cutting personal income tax rates this year, according to the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., group generally skeptical of higher taxes.",
      "\u201cWe've seen a lot of states cut their income tax rates in the last four or five years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and coming out of it,\u201d said Aravind Boddupalli, senior researcher at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C.",
      "Supporters say cuts help a state compete for new residents and businesses, pointing to growth in Texas and Florida, two states without personal income taxes.",
      "\u201cYour income tax is a tax on productivity,\u201d said Manish Bhatt, who studies state taxes for the Tax Foundation. \u201cIf you are taxing productivity, you are potentially losing out on economic gains.\u201d",
      "Georgia has already been cutting income taxes, taking what was once a top income tax rate of 6% and lowering it to a 5.19% flat rate. Republicans broadly support a further cut for individual and corporate taxpayers to 4.99% this year, worth an estimated $800 million in foregone tax revenue.",
      "The Senate plan would then freeze the corporate rate and focus on individual tax cuts. It proposes in 2027 to exempt the first $50,000 of income for a single person or $100,000 for a married couple, up from $12,000 and $24,000 now.",
      "Faced with Democratic criticism about affordability, the big increase in exempt income is central to Republicans' own arguments about how they can make money stretch farther. About 70% of Georgians reported less than $100,000 of taxable income in 2024, according to state figures.",

      "\u201cIt is a plan that gives benefits first to hardworking families,\u201d Tillery said.",
      "The initial rate cut, plus the exemption proposal, would lower Georgia revenue by $3.8 billion in its 2027 budget year. Tillery says the state could pay by using surplus tax revenue and shifting back to paying for capital expenditures through borrowing instead of cash. But those moves probably wouldn't cover the foregone revenue even in the first year, much less $13 billion more in cuts to get to zero.",
      "Tillery said revenue should be bolstered by trimming business income and sales tax breaks, saying legislators should reduce \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201d But lawmakers and Kemp have balked at curtailing those measures in recent years.",
      "Tax cuts haven't always been a political bonanza. In Kansas, after Republicans under Gov. Sam Brownback cut income taxes steeply more than a decade ago, voters revolted at budget cuts and lawmakers imposed multiple tax increases to cover persistent budget shortfalls, including restoring some income tax cuts. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly won her first term in 2018 by framing the race as a referendum on Brownback\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cState income taxes are only bad if you fundamentally don't believe that the services, the public investments that state governments provide, are worth anything,\u201d said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy .",
      "In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe and GOP legislative leaders have made phasing out the state\u2019s income tax a top priority for the session starting Wednesday. They're looking to expand sales taxes to services which currently are untaxed to help offset lost revenue.",
      "\u201cWe want to do this in a smart, efficient way that\u2019s not going to have the state go off some sort of fiscal cliff,\u201d Missouri House Majority Leader Alex Riley told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "But expanding sales taxes could fall more heavily on poorer taxpayers. The liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute estimated that if Georgia doesn't expand its sales tax, the combined state and local sales tax rate would have to rise sharply from the current 7.42% to recover revenue losses.",
      "All that leads to questions about income-tax elimination plans, even from Republicans. Burns, the Georgia House speaker, said he's \u201copen\u201d to any plan that benefits Georgians.",
      "\u201cBut we've got to have the details, and it has to work,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe need to make sure we can continue to do vital services \u2014 health care, public safety, education, all the things we talked about.\u201d",

      "California will lose $160 million for delaying the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver\u2019s licenses for immigrants, federal transportation officials announced Wednesday.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy already withheld $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn\u2019t enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "The state notified these drivers in the fall that they would lose their licenses after a federal audit found problems that included licenses for truckers and bus drivers that remained valid long after an immigrant\u2019s visa expired. Some licenses were also given to citizens of Mexico and Canada who don't qualify. More than one-quarter of the small sample of California licenses that investigators reviewed were unlawful.",
      "But then last week California said it would delay those revocations until March after immigrant groups sued the state because of concerns that some groups were being unfairly targeted. Duffy said the state was supposed to revoke those licenses by Monday.",
      "Duffy is pressuring California and other states to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren\u2019t granted the licenses.",
      "\u201cOur demands were simple: follow the rules, revoke the unlawfully-issued licenses to dangerous foreign drivers, and fix the system so this never happens again,\u201d Duffy said in a statement. \u201c(Gov.) Gavin Newsom has failed to do so \u2014 putting the needs of illegal immigrants over the safety of the American people.\u201d",
      "California DMV spokesperson Eva Spiegel said the state complies with all regulations and had positive conversations with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration officials about delaying the revocations to allow time for the federal agency to complete its review if the state's commercial driver's license program.",
      "\u201cWe strongly disagree with the federal government\u2019s decision to withhold vital transportation funding from California \u2014 their action jeopardizes public safety because these funds are critical for maintaining and improving the roadways we all rely on every day,\u201d Spiegel said.",
      "But in the official letter the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration sent Wednesday, federal officials said they never agreed to the delay after the state suggested it and still expected the 17,000 licenses to be revoked by this week.",
      "The federal government began cracking down during the summer. The issue became prominent after a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, New York, Texas, South Dakota, Colorado, and Washington after audits found significant problems under the existing rules, including commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver\u2019s work permit expired. He had dropped the threat to withhold nearly $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses.",

      "\u201cWe will not accept a corrective plan that knowingly leaves thousands of drivers holding noncompliant licenses behind the wheel of 80,000-pound trucks in open defiance of federal safety regulations,\u201d Barrs said.",
      "Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn\u2019t have licenses or can\u2019t speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department\u2019s moves to go after questionable commercial driver\u2019s license schools.",
      "\u201cFor too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk,\u201d said Todd Spencer, president of the Owner Operator Independent Drivers Association.",
      "The spotlight has been on Sikh truckers because the driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs. So the Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but these non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver\u2019s licenses or about 200,000 drivers.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he wants to block large institutional investors from buying houses, saying that a ban would make it easier for younger families to buy their first homes.",
      "Trump \u2014 who has been under pressure to address voters' concerns about affordability ahead of November midterm elections \u2014 is tapping into long-standing fears that corporate ownership of homes has pushed out traditional buyers, forcing more people to rent. But his plan does little to address the overarching challenge for the housing market: a national shortage of home construction and prices that have climbed faster than incomes.",
      "\u201cPeople live in homes, not corporations,\u201d Trump said in a social media post as he called on Congress to codify his ban.",
      "Last month, Trump pledged in a prime-time address that he would roll out \u201csome of the most aggressive housing reform plans in American history\u201d this year. The president said he would discuss housing and affordability in more detail in two weeks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an event known for attracting CEOs, wealthy financiers and academics with a global focus who often run contrary to Trump's populist rhetoric.",
      "The president has in the past floated extending the 30-year mortgage to 50 years in order to lower monthly payments, an idea that has been criticized because it would reduce people's ability to create housing equity and increase their own wealth.",
      "With Trump's proposed ban, the challenge is that institutional investors are only a tiny sliver of homebuyers, accounting for just 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank based in Washington, D.C. The analysis defined these investors as owning 100 or more properties.",

      "The larger challenge has been a shortage of new construction, such that Goldman Sachs in October estimated in October that 3 million to 4 million additional homes beyond the normal construction levels would need to be built to relieve cost pressures.

      "MEDINA, Ohio -- The four suspects involved in the burglary of Shedeur Sanders' home on Nov. 16 are from Atlanta and used a stolen rental car in the break-in, authorities said Thursday.",
      "The Medina County Sheriff's Office also said during a briefing that the group had robbed others, including professional athletes.",
      "Jarvet Myrick, Deandrez Jackson and Maurice Exavier Taylor are in custody after being arrested in Georgia and are awaiting extradition to Northeast Ohio. Carlos DeAnthony Morris remains at large and has an active warrant.",
      "Detective Rodney Rees said that the suspects stole the rental car in the Atlanta area, drove to Ohio and stayed at a hotel in Medina Township the night before the burglary took place.",
      "The suspects then robbed a house in the Atlanta suburb of Brookhaven upon returning to Georgia on Nov. 17, Rees said.",
      "Myrick, the alleged driver, was arrested on Nov. 26. Jackson was arrested Dec. 16 and Taylor on Dec. 29. All three are facing second-degree felony burglary charges. All three were also arrested with guns. Jackson had warrants from when he was a juvenile and Taylor also had outstanding warrants. Myrick also was in possession of marijuana when he was arrested.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re violent. They\u2019re part of two burglaries we know of and possibly a third one where they were seen running away with guns in their hands,\" Rees said. \u201cThey target high-end individuals who have a lot of money, and they go to their houses, they break in, and they take anything of value, and they go and sell it.\"",
      "It wasn't immediately clear who would represent the suspects when they get to Ohio.",
      "Sanders\u2019 home in Granger Township, a Cleveland suburb, was burglarized while he was playing in his first regular-season NFL game during the second half of the Browns\u2019 23-16 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Approximately $200,000 in property was stolen from the home, which included totes, luxury bags and a ring.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office previously stated that three people entered the home at 6:46 p.m. ET. Surveillance cameras in the home captured video of the people entering different parts of the house. They were wearing masks and gloves and were seen leaving the home just before 7 p.m.",
      "Rees said they haven't been able to recover the stolen items.",

      "The burglary added Sanders to a growing list of NFL players whose homes have been burglarized during games. Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, and New Orleans Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan have dealt with break-ins since the start of last season.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, right now, they\u2019re just targets. They\u2019re taking advantage of them being some type of stature in the community and they\u2019re hitting them when they\u2019re away from home and they know they\u2019re away from home,\u201d Rees said.",
      "Rees said authorities believe there is a ringleader who leads people to the high-profile athletes, but that has not been proven yet. He said the cases involving other professional athletes the suspects are accused of burglarizing were not made public yet.",
      "Tennessee Titans defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons' home was also burglarized last month while the team had a road game against San Francisco, but Rees said no one from this group is suspected.",
      "Sanders, the son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, played in eight games during his rookie NFL season. The fifth-round pick started the Browns\u2019 final seven games and passed for 1,400 yards with seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions.",

      "But No. 1 Indiana is here, one win away from playing for its first national championship because the players remain motivated to prove something to themselves \u2014 and to the college football world.",
      "\u201cYou're always chasing that perfect game as a defense and for us that chip will always be there,\u201d Jones said Tuesday. \u201cA lot of these guys had chips (on their shoulders) before they got to Indiana and so did I. So having that chip is what got us here, and I don't think it's ever going to go away.\u201d",
      "These Hoosiers have been trying to show their values to a wider audience for years.",
      "Jones grew up in central Ohio but didn\u2019t get much attention from his home state Buckeyes. Linebacker Aiden Fisher landed at James Madison as a zero-star recruit. Defensive end Mikail Kamara joined him with the Dukes after receiving several other scholarship offers from smaller schools, and cornerback D\u2019Angelo Ponds grew weary of hearing constant questions about his 5-foot-9 frame.",
      "And even though Stephen Daley suffered a right leg injury that will keep him out of Friday night's Peach Bowl against No. 5 Oregon, he didn't let anyone deter his journey from 230-pound, two-way star to all-conference defensive linemen. Yes, the guy his local fans once compared to Derrick Henry because he qualified for the Virginia state track and field championships in the 100-meter dash, as the anchor of the 4x100-meter relay and, yes, in the discus, started his career at Kent State and created one of the sport's most unusual one-year transitions \u2014 going from the 0-12 Golden Flashes in 2024 to the top-ranked and still unbeaten 14-0 Hoosiers this year.",
      "Together, they've formed one of the nation's stingiest defenses \u2014 one still trying to demonstrate its stifling performance in October's 30-20 win at Oregon was no fluke. The Ducks (13-1) understand the challenge.",
      "\u201cObviously, they have great players,\u201d Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq said. \u201cSecond to that, they have great schemes. So, I mean, when you look at the stunts they do, the same pressures, all those things, just even players winning their one-on-ones on the edges, the edges do a great job.\u201d",
      "Current and former coaches have often praised Indiana's defense for its uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time on almost every play. That's by design.",
      "But the Ducks defense also has something to prove after losing twice in the past 13 months.",
      "In last January's Rose Bowl rematch against Ohio State, the Buckeyes jumped out to a 34-0 lead and avenged their only loss of the season with a 41-21 rout over No. 1 and previously unbeaten Oregon, the Big Ten champs.",
      "Then in October, Oregon took advantage of a Pick-6 thrown by Indiana's first Heisman Trophy winner, Fernando Mendoza, to tie the score at 20 in the fourth quarter \u2014 only to watch Mendoza march the Hoosiers right down the field for the tiebreaking touchdown on Indiana's next series.",

      "Not only did he endure this year's only loss, Thieneman also was on the field when Indiana dealt Purdue its most lopsided loss in school history, 66-0, in the 2024 regular-season finale. Naturally, he hasn't forgotten.",
      "\"Props to them for what they\u2019ve done. I definitely have my own kind of feelings about the (Oregon) game and that team and stuff,\u201d he said before cracking a smile. \u201cI know a few guys on that team.

      "Implementing that message is up to the Hoosiers as they try to defy history one more time.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve improved drastically. So for me, I\u2019m scouting a whole new team,\" Fisher said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s two teams seeing each other for the first time, in my mind. You treat it like that. You prepare for it like that. I can speak for a lot of guys with that, our coaches, too. We\u2019re treating it like it\u2019s the biggest game of the year because it\u2019s the next one and you've got to prepare for it like that.\u201d",

      "The 18-year-olds born minutes apart in Brooklyn have been all over the globe competing in lower-tier races in an effort to qualify for the technical events, slalom and giant slalom. Henri already has a spot, in the slalom, and his sisters are close. The deadline is Jan. 18.",

      "When a game kicks off in the Spanish league about 50 analysts start looking for signs of online piracy",
      "MADRID -- Once the ball starts rolling in the Spanish league, the game is on for some 50 analysts who start looking for signs of online piracy.",
      "They scan websites, social media posts, IPTV platforms and streaming portals in search of illegal broadcasts of La Liga matches.",
      "The trained analysts identify the pirated content and take the steps needed to take them off air, including notifying Internet intermediaries like Cloudflare, the U.S.-based company whose content-delivery network is believed to manage nearly 20% of the Internet traffic worldwide.",
      "And that\u2019s when the real fight begins for the Spanish league.",
      "La Liga, one of the most active European leagues fighting piracy and audiovisual fraud, accuses Cloudflare of ignoring illegal content and not doing enough to block it. It says Cloudflare plays a decisive role in the dissemination of online piracy that significantly hurts the soccer industry.",
      "Protecting its content is key for the league, which recently sold domestic audiovisual rights for more than 6 billion euros ($7 billion) through the 2031-32 season.",
      "Spanish league president Javier Tebas told The Associated Press in an email that Cloudflare is an organization \u201cfully aware that a significant share of sports audiovisual piracy relies on its infrastructure and, despite this knowledge, it continues to protect and monetize that activity, as recognized by courts in multiple jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "Tebas said that in Spain alone, more than 35% of La Liga's content piracy continues to be distributed through Cloudflare\u2019s infrastructure, despite thousands of formal notices and judicially backed enforcement measures implemented by Internet service providers.",
      "\"This is not a legal, technical or ideological debate, but a case of a company prioritizing its commercial interests and financial gain over the law, the sustainability of the global sports industry, and the protection of its own customers, whom it uses as a digital shield for organized piracy networks,\u201d Tebas said.",
      "Cloudflare, which describes itself as a \u201clong-standing champion of a free and open Internet,\u201d denies wrongdoing and accuses the league of bullying its way into controlling what Spanish users see online during matches.",
      "Cloudflare told the AP that the league\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate blocking practices\u201d have kept Spanish users from accessing tens of thousands of legitimate sites while the games are on.",
      "The company said La Liga thinks that its commercial interests can \u201ctrump the right of ordinary Spanish users to browse lawful sites\u201d during matches.",
      "Cloudflare has encouraged Spanish users who notice lawful sites getting blocked because of La Liga to track those blocks and tell their lawmakers. Cloudflare highlights the need to fight \u201cInternet censorship and the harm it causes.\u201d",
      "\u201cCloudflare regularly works collaboratively with rightsholders to help address issues like illegal streaming,\u201d it said. \u201cLa Liga, however, has shown no interest in this type of collaboration, believing instead they can bully their way to having complete control over what Spanish users see online during football matches by making unsupported claims and threats.\u201d",

      "La Liga notes there is collaboration among several other intermediaries, including Google, Amazon and YouTube, but says Cloudflare has rejected similar collaboration efforts with the league.",
      "The Spanish league has been successful in achieving court rulings against piracy in Spain, which also impacts Cloudflare, but it remains unable to get the company to block some of the illegal content internationally.",
      "Cloudflare has fought back in the courts, filing appeals to \u201cdemonstrate that La Liga\u2019s overblocking practices are illegal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are also engaging with talking to politicians and regulators, as well as civil society to find collaborative solutions to combating illegal sports streaming without impeding Internet access for millions of Spanish users,\u201d it said.",
      "Cloudflare faces similar legal issues in Italy, France, Germany and Japan, among other countries. The Italian league said it has taken action against Cloudflare multiple times and will continue to do so. In Germany, the local league said it was in \u201cregular and intensive communication with Cloudflare in order to combat the issue of digital piracy in the best possible way.\u201d",
      "Cloudflare recently told the United States Trade Representative that the actions by foreign countries constitute digital trade barriers that contradict global norms and disproportionately impact U.S. technology providers, hindering market access in some countries.",
      "The Spanish league has also reached out to the European Commission and the USTR to complain about Cloudflare\u2019s practices. It told the USTR that Cloudflare was the main facilitator for unauthorized broadcasts of La Liga and other pirated content worldwide.",
      "Cloudflare claims that its network is vital to the U.S.\u2019 economic and security interests.",
      "\u201cWe urge the U.S. government to continue its resolute advocacy on behalf of American businesses to dismantle these structural barriers and ensure a global digital environment that rewards innovation and fair trade,\u201d it said.",
      "The USTR did not answer an AP email requesting comment.",

      "DeepSeek, a Chinese tech startup, is gaining traction in developing nations, narrowing the AI adoption gap with advanced economies",
      "HONG KONG -- DeepSeek, the Chinese tech startup that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT, has been gaining ground in many developing nations in a trend that could narrow the gap of artificial intelligence adoption with advanced economies, a new report suggested.",
      "In the Thursday report, researchers from Microsoft said global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world\u2019s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the previous three months.",
      "Yet the divide of AI adoption in developed and developing countries is widening, the report noted, with AI adoption across advanced economies growing nearly twice as fast as developing nations.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing a divide and we are concerned that that divide will continue to widen,\u201d said Juan Lavista Ferres, chief data scientist for Microsoft's AI for Good Lab, which used anonymized \u201ctelemetry\u201d to help track global device usage.",
      "Countries that invested early and consistently in digital infrastructure and AI led in terms of shares of users, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, France and Spain, according to the report. Some of Microsoft's figures overlapped with the findings of a Pew Research Center survey published in October that mapped which countries are more excited than concerned about AI. In both reports, for instance, South Korea stood out in its embrace of AI.",
      "Microsoft has a vested interest in AI adoption \u2014 its business and much of the tech industry and stock market is staking its future on AI tools becoming more widely used and profitable \u2014 but Lavista Ferres said his lab is looking more broadly at the topic.",
      "His researchers found that the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which was founded in 2023, has fueled wider AI adoption across the developing world given its free and \u201copen source\u201d models \u2013 with key components available for anyone to access and modify.",
      "When DeepSeek released its advanced reasoning AI model called R1 in January 2025, which it said was more cost-effective than OpenAI\u2019s similar model, it raised eyebrows in the global technology industry and many were surprised by how China is catching up with the U.S. in technological advancements. Leading science journal Nature published peer-reviewed research co-authored by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng in September, describing it as a \u201clandmark paper\u201d from the Chinese startup.",
      "Lavista Ferres said DeepSeek is a \u201cgood model\u201d for tasks like math or coding, but it operates differently from U.S.-based models on topics like politics.",
      "\u201cWe have observed that for certain type of questions, of course, they follow the same type of access to the internet that China has,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means that there will be questions that will be answered very differently, particularly political questions. In many ways that can have an influence on the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek offers a free\u2011to\u2011use chatbot on web and mobile, and has also given developers global access to modify and build on its core engine. Its lack of subscription fees has \"lowered the barrier for millions of users, especially in price\u2011sensitive regions,\u201d Microsoft's report said.",

      "Developed countries including Australia, Germany and the U.S. have sought to limit the use of DeepSeek over alleged security risks. Microsoft last year banned its own employees from using DeepSeek. Adoption of DeepSeek remained low in North America and Europe, the report found, but it surged in its home country China, as well as Russia, Iran, Cuba, Belarus \u2013 places where U.S. services face restrictions or where foreign tech access is limited.",
      "In many places, DeepSeek\u2019s prevalence correlated with it being a default chatbot on widely available phones made by Chinese tech companies like Huawei.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s market share in China was 89%, the report estimated. That\u2019s followed by Belarus\u2019s 56% and Cuba\u2019s 49%, both of which also had low AI adoption more broadly. In Russia, its market share was around 43%.",
      "In Syria and Iran, DeepSeek\u2019s market share reached around 23% and 25%, respectively, the report added. In many African countries including Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Niger, DeepSeek\u2019s market share was between 11% to 14%.",

      "Without issuing an official ruling, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers made it clear that she intended to reject OpenAI's motion to dismiss a 17-month-old case that Musk filed against a San Francisco startup that he helped create in 2015.",
      "\u201cThis case is going to trial,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said emphatically during an occasionally testy 90-minute hearing held in Oakland, California.",
      "The judge said she still needed to figure out some of the logistics of how the trial will be set up, as well as whether to dismiss unjust enrichment allegations that Musk has made against Microsoft, which has accumulated a $135 billion stake in OpenAI since investing $1 billion in a for-profit subsidiary that the startup created in 2019.",
      "But the judge told lawyers that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to consider in a legal showdown pitting Musk \u2014 the world's richest man with an estimated fortune of $713 billion \u2014 against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose fortune is currently pegged at $2 billion. Both billionaires would likely be summoned to court to testify under oath if the trial proceeds.",
      "\u201cPart of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said.",

      "The case revolves around OpenAI's origins as a nonprofit research lab that Musk and Altman launched to develop artificial intelligence designed primarily for the good of humanity. That mission, the two founders believed, could serve as a foil to AI being developed by Google and other profit-driven companies that, they claimed, could deploy the technology recklessly as they strived to make more money.",

      "Although Altman sought to reassure Musk he remained committed to OpenAI's non-profit mission, Musk decided to cut ties with the startup and eventually launched a rival, xAI, that was valued at $230 billion in a just-completed fundraising.",
      "A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.",
      "In the diary, Brockman mused about his desire to become a billionaire and wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking that maybe we should just flip to a for profit. Making the money for us sounds great and all,\u201d according to court filings.",
      "At one point, OpenAI's own board of directors had serious enough misgivings about Altman's motives to trigger his firing in 2023 before quickly bringing him back as CEO in a comeback that Microsoft helped orchestrate.",
      "One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred. That's because there's a three-year statute of limitations on his fraud claims.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred. The trial then would be allowed to proceed to the fraud phase if it's determined that the suspected deceit began less than three years before Musk's August 2024 filing of his lawsuit.",

      "The Philippines has evacuated nearly 3,000 villagers from a danger zone on the foothills of the Mayon Volcano after officials raised the alert level due to recent activity",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A series of mild eruptions at the most active volcano in the Philippines has prompted the evacuation of nearly 3,000 villagers from a danger zone on its foothills, officials said Wednesday.",
      "Authorities raised the 5-step alert around Mayon Volcano in the northeastern province of Albay to level 3 on Tuesday after detecting intermittent rockfalls, some as big as cars, from its peak crater in recent days along with deadly pyroclastic flows \u2014 a fast-moving avalanche of super-hot rock fragments, ash and gas.",
      "Alert level 5 would indicate that a major explosive eruption, often with violent ejections of ash and debris and widespread ashfall, is underway.",
      "\u201cThis is already an eruption, a quiet one, with lava accumulating up the peak and swelling the dome, which cracked in some parts and resulted in rockfalls, some as big as cars,\u201d Teresito Bacolcol, the country's chief volcanologist, told The Associated Press.",
      "He said it is too early to tell if Mayon\u2019s restiveness would worsen and lead to a major and violent eruption given the absence of other key signs of unrest, like a spike in volcanic earthquakes and high levels of sulfur dioxide emissions.",
      "Troops, police and disaster-mitigation personnel helped evacuate more than 2,800 villagers from 729 households inside a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) radius from the volcano\u2019s crater that officials have long designated a permanent danger zone, demarcated by concrete warning signs, Albay provincial officials said.",
      "Another 600 villagers living outside the permanent danger zone have evacuated voluntarily to government-run emergency shelters to be safely away from the volcano, Claudio Yucot, regional director of the Office of Civil Defense, said.",

      "As CES opened Tuesday to the public, auto and tech companies like Nvidia and Gentex showed how AI technology can transform cars into proactive companions that adapt and react to drivers and passengers in real time",
      "LAS VEGAS -- In a vision of the near future shared at CES, a girl slides into the back seat of her parents' car and the cabin instantly comes alive. The vehicle recognizes her, knows it\u2019s her birthday and cues up her favorite song without a word spoken.",
      "\u201cThink of the car as having a soul and being an extension of your family,\u201d Sri Subramanian, Nvidia's global head of generative AI for automotive, said Tuesday.",
      "Subramanian's example, shared with a CES audience on the show's opening day in Las Vegas, illustrates the growing sophistication of AI-powered in-cabin systems and the expanding scope of personal data that smart vehicles may collect, retain and use to shape the driving experience.",
      "Across the show floor, the car emerged less as a machine and more as a companion as automakers and tech companies showcased vehicles that can adapt to drivers and passengers in real time \u2014 from tracking heart rates and emotions to alerting if a baby or young child is accidentally left in the car.",

      "Unlike smartphones or online platforms, cars have only recently become major repositories of personal data, Brookman said. As a result, the industry is still trying to establish the \u201crules of the road\u201d for what automakers and tech companies are allowed to do with driver data.",
      "That uncertainty is compounded by the uniquely personal nature of cars, Brookman said. Many people see their vehicles as an extension of themselves \u2014 or even their homes \u2014 which he said can make the presence of cameras, microphones and other monitoring tools feel especially invasive.",

      "LONDON -- Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is facing a backlash from governments around the world after a recent surge in sexualized images of women and children generated without consent by the artificial intelligence-powered tool.",
      "On Tuesday, Britain's top technology official demanded that Musk's social media platform X take urgent action while a Polish lawmaker cited it as a reason to enact digital safety laws.",

      "Rising alarm from disparate nations points to the nightmarish potential of nudification apps that use artificial intelligence to generate sexually explicit deepfake images.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look:",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others. As of Tuesday, Grok users could still generate images of women using requests such as, \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "The problem is amplified both because Musk pitches his chatbot as an edgier alternative to rivals with more safeguards, and because Grok's images are publicly visible, and can therefore be easily spread.",

      "A golden phone that President Donald Trump's family business promised to release last year remains mysteriously under wraps as the technology industry serves up a glut of new gadgets at CES in Las Vegas this week.",
      "When the Trump Organization launched a mobile phone service last June, it was supposed to be a stage setter for a new smartphone bathed in gold with a $500 price tag \u2014 a bargain compared to Apple's latest iPhone models that sell for anywhere from $800 to $1,200. The newly formed Trump Mobile targeted its T1 phone for an August or September release.",
      "What's more, Trump Mobile initially hailed T1 as a device that would be \u201cproudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best.\"",
      "But both the T1's shipping date and U.S. manufacturing ambitions gradually began to shift, even as Trump Mobile continues to accept $100 deposits for the device.",
      "Not long after announcing the device, Trump Mobile pivoted from describing it as phone that would be made in the U.S. to framing it as a device that would be \u201cproudly American.\u201d Trump Mobile's website now touts the T1 as having an \u201cAmerican-proud\u201d design, with no further explanation.",
      "Analysts believed that the shift stemmed from a recognition that the U.S. lacked the supply chain and other logistics required to make a smartphone for less than $1,000 \u2014 the same hurdles that made it implausible for Apple to acquiesce to President Trump's demands that the company move its iPhone manufacturing from China and India.",
      "Later in the summer, Trump Mobile also became more vague about when the T1 would become available, but still indicated it would be delivered to customers who paid the $100 deposit by the end of 2025. Trump Mobile's website continues to list the T1's targeted release date as \u201clater this year.\u201d",

      "The court pointed to \u201cparticularly degrading, insulting, and malicious\u201d comments referring to false claims regarding alleged trans identity and alleged pedo criminality targeting Brigitte Macron. \u201cRepeated publications have had cumulative harmful effects,\u201d the court said.",
      "The defendants, eight men and two women aged 41 to 65, were accused of having posted numerous comments falsely claiming that President Emmanuel Macron \u2019s wife was born a man and likening their 24-year age gap to pedophilia. Some of the posts were viewed tens of thousands of times.",

She said the impact has extended to the entire family, including Macron\u2019s grandchildren.",

      "The multiday event, organized by the Consumer Technology Association, kicks off this week in Las Vegas, where advances across industries like robotics, healthcare, vehicles, wearables, gaming and more are set to be on display.",
      "Artificial intelligence will be anchored in nearly everything, again, as the tech industry explores offerings consumers will want to buy. AI industry heavyweight Jensen Huang will be taking the stage to showcase Nvidia's latest productivity solutions, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will keynote to \u201cshare her vision for delivering future AI solutions.\u201d Expect AI to come up in other keynotes, like from Lenovo's CEO, Yuanqing Yang.",

Extended reality, basically a virtual training ground for robots and other physical AI, is also in the buzz around CES.",

And at this show, for the first time, we have a Korean company showing the first ever small-scale nuclear-powered energy creation device. We expect more and more of these people rushing to fill this gap because we need the energy, we need it clean and we need a kind of all-of-the-above solution.",

      "\u201cYou might as well take chips off the table,\u201d Kossof said. \u201cThe thing is you could have power to a site and it\u2019s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.\u201d",
      "Some in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers \u2014 such as polluting water and air \u2014 and are difficult to overcome.",
      "Still, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers.",
      "\u201cIt's definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, \u2018Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?\u2019\u201d said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers.",

      "Developers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat.",
      "The project would have funded half the city\u2019s budget and developers promised environmentally friendly features. But town meetings overflowed, and emails, texts and phone calls were overwhelmingly opposed, \u201c999 to one against,\u201d Higdon said.",
      "Had council approved it, \u201cevery person that voted for it would no longer be in office,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cThat's for sure.\u201d",
      "In Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city\u2019s environmental review was adequate.",
      "Residents found each other through social media and, from there, learned to organize, protest, door-knock and get their message out.",
      "They say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city \u2014 responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy \u2014 released internal emails that confirmed it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the secrecy. The secrecy just drives people crazy,\u201d said Jonathan Thornton, a realtor who lives across a road from the site.",
      "Documents revealing the extent of the project emerged days before a city rezoning vote in October. Mortenson, which is developing it for a Fortune 50 company that it hasn't named, says it is considering changes based on public feedback and that \u201cmore engagement with the community is appropriate.\"",
      "Rebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm.",
      "She found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle.",

      "U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield blocked subpoenas requested by John Sarcone, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York.",
      "\u201cThe subpoenas are unenforceable due to a threshold defect: Mr. Sarcone was not lawfully serving as Acting U.S. Attorney when the subpoenas were issued,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "James, a Democrat, had challenged Sarcone\u2019s authority after he issued subpoenas seeking information about lawsuits she filed against President Donald Trump, claiming he had committed fraud in his business dealings, and separately against the National Rifle Association and some of its former leaders.",

      "Georgia is the latest state to consider eliminating its personal income tax, with Republican leaders in the Senate backing a proposal to phase it out by 2032",
      "ATLANTA -- Eliminating state income taxes sounds great to many voters, but Republicans backing the push in multiple states still face questions about whether such big tax cuts can be made without raising other taxes or sharply cutting state funding for education, health care and other services.",
      "Georgia on Wednesday became the latest state to launch a bid to abolish its personal income tax, with Republican leaders in the Senate backing a proposal to zero it out by 2032. This year, Georgia's personal income tax is projected to collect about $16.5 billion, or 44% of the state's general revenue.",
      "The push is driven by politics. Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, the Republican who leads the state Senate, has made eliminating income taxes a centerpiece of his 2026 campaign for governor. State Sen. Blake Tillery, a Vidalia Republican who led a committee to abolish the tax, is among candidates to succeed Jones as lieutenant governor.",
      "\u201cThis is the first vote that we are going to get to take to address affordability,\u201d Tillery said.",
      "But it's unclear if the proposal will pass. Georgia House Republicans may want to continue nibbling away at the tax in smaller bites, preferring a \u201cmeasured\u201d approach. Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington said Wednesday that his big 2026 goal is to eliminate property taxes for homeowners, but said he's willing to consider the Senate plan.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, serving his last year, has been cool to total elimination of the income tax. He declined to comment Wednesday on the Senate plan, but spokesperson Carter Chapman said Kemp wants \"to continue lowering taxes and putting more money in Georgians\u2019 pockets as he has throughout his term.\u201d",
      "The state's Democratic minority opposes the move, saying it would mostly benefit high earners and the state needs money to provide services.",
      "Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi and Missouri have all set goals to abolish the personal income tax, joining eight other states that don't tax personal income. Eight other states besides Georgia are cutting personal income tax rates this year, according to the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., group generally skeptical of higher taxes.",
      "\u201cWe've seen a lot of states cut their income tax rates in the last four or five years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and coming out of it,\u201d said Aravind Boddupalli, senior researcher at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C.",
      "Supporters say cuts help a state compete for new residents and businesses, pointing to growth in Texas and Florida, two states without personal income taxes.",
      "\u201cYour income tax is a tax on productivity,\u201d said Manish Bhatt, who studies state taxes for the Tax Foundation. \u201cIf you are taxing productivity, you are potentially losing out on economic gains.\u201d",
      "Georgia has already been cutting income taxes, taking what was once a top income tax rate of 6% and lowering it to a 5.19% flat rate. Republicans broadly support a further cut for individual and corporate taxpayers to 4.99% this year, worth an estimated $800 million in foregone tax revenue.",
      "The Senate plan would then freeze the corporate rate and focus on individual tax cuts. It proposes in 2027 to exempt the first $50,000 of income for a single person or $100,000 for a married couple, up from $12,000 and $24,000 now.",
      "Faced with Democratic criticism about affordability, the big increase in exempt income is central to Republicans' own arguments about how they can make money stretch farther. About 70% of Georgians reported less than $100,000 of taxable income in 2024, according to state figures.",

      "The initial rate cut, plus the exemption proposal, would lower Georgia revenue by $3.8 billion in its 2027 budget year. Tillery says the state could pay by using surplus tax revenue and shifting back to paying for capital expenditures through borrowing instead of cash. But those moves probably wouldn't cover the foregone revenue even in the first year, much less $13 billion more in cuts to get to zero.",
      "Tillery said revenue should be bolstered by trimming business income and sales tax breaks, saying legislators should reduce \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201d But lawmakers and Kemp have balked at curtailing those measures in recent years.",
      "Tax cuts haven't always been a political bonanza. In Kansas, after Republicans under Gov. Sam Brownback cut income taxes steeply more than a decade ago, voters revolted at budget cuts and lawmakers imposed multiple tax increases to cover persistent budget shortfalls, including restoring some income tax cuts. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly won her first term in 2018 by framing the race as a referendum on Brownback\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cState income taxes are only bad if you fundamentally don't believe that the services, the public investments that state governments provide, are worth anything,\u201d said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy .",
      "In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe and GOP legislative leaders have made phasing out the state\u2019s income tax a top priority for the session starting Wednesday. They're looking to expand sales taxes to services which currently are untaxed to help offset lost revenue.",
      "\u201cWe want to do this in a smart, efficient way that\u2019s not going to have the state go off some sort of fiscal cliff,\u201d Missouri House Majority Leader Alex Riley told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "But expanding sales taxes could fall more heavily on poorer taxpayers. The liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute estimated that if Georgia doesn't expand its sales tax, the combined state and local sales tax rate would have to rise sharply from the current 7.42% to recover revenue losses.",
      "All that leads to questions about income-tax elimination plans, even from Republicans. Burns, the Georgia House speaker, said he's \u201copen\u201d to any plan that benefits Georgians.",
      "\u201cBut we've got to have the details, and it has to work,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe need to make sure we can continue to do vital services \u2014 health care, public safety, education, all the things we talked about.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration will withdraw from dozens of international organizations, including the U.N.'s population agency and the U.N. treaty that establishes international climate negotiations, as the U.S. further retreats from global cooperation.",
      "President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending U.S. support for 66 organizations, agencies and commissions following his instructions for his administration to review participation in and funding for all international organizations, including those affiliated with the United Nations, according to a White House statement on social media.",
      "Most of the targets are U.N.-related agencies, commissions and advisory panels that focus on climate, labor and other issues that the Trump administration has categorized as catering to diversity and \u201cwoke\u201d initiatives.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation\u2019s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,\u201d the State Department said in a statement.",
      "Trump's decision to withdraw from organizations that foster cooperation among nations to address global challenges comes as his administration has launched military efforts or issued threats that have rattled allies and adversaries alike, including capturing autocratic Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and indicating an intention to take over Greenland.",
      "The administration previously suspended support from agencies like the World Health Organization, the U.N. for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO as it has taken a larger, a-la-carte approach to paying its dues to the world body, picking which operations and agencies they believe align with Trump\u2019s agenda and those which no longer serve U.S. interests.",

      "It has marked a major shift from how previous administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democratic \u2014 have dealt with the U.N., and it has forced the world body, already undergoing its own internal reckoning, to respond with a series of staffing and program cuts.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy already withheld $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn\u2019t enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "The state notified these drivers in the fall that they would lose their licenses after a federal audit found problems that included licenses for truckers and bus drivers that remained valid long after an immigrant\u2019s visa expired. More than one-quarter of the small sample of California licenses that investigators reviewed were unlawful.",
      "But then last week California said it would delay those revocations until March after immigrant groups sued the state because of concerns that some groups were being unfairly targeted. Duffy said the state was supposed to revoke those licenses by Monday.",
      "Duffy is pressuring California and other states to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren\u2019t granted the licenses.",
      "\u201cOur demands were simple: follow the rules, revoke the unlawfully-issued licenses to dangerous foreign drivers, and fix the system so this never happens again,\u201d Duffy said in a written statement. \u201c(Gov.) Gavin Newsom has failed to do so \u2014 putting the needs of illegal immigrants over the safety of the American people.\"",
      "Newsom's office did not immediately respond after the action was announced Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The federal government began cracking down during the summer. The issue became prominent after a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",

He had dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses.",
      "Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Administrator Derek Barrs said California failed to live up to the promise it made in November to revoke all the flawed licenses by Jan. 5.",

      "The spotlight has been on Sikh truckers because the driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs. So the Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but these non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver\u2019s licenses or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed setting U.S. military spending at $1.5 trillion in 2027, citing \u201ctroubled and dangerous times.\u201d",
      "Trump called for the massive surge in spending days after he ordered a U.S. military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and spirit him out of the country to face drug trafficking charges in the United States. U.S. forces continue to mass in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The 2026 military budget is set at $901 billion.",
      "Trump in recent days has also called for taking over the Danish territory of Greenland for national security reasons and has suggested he\u2019s open to carrying out military operations in Colombia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ominously warned that longtime adversary Cuba \u201cis in trouble.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis will allow us to build the \u2018Dream Military\u2019 that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,\u201d Trump said in a posting on Truth Social announcing his proposal.",
      "The military just received a large boost of some $175 billion in the GOP\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d of tax breaks and spending reductions that Trump signed into law last year.",
      "Insisting on more funding for the Pentagon is almost certain to run into resistance from Democrats who work to maintain parity between changes in defense and non-defense spending. But it\u2019s also sure to draw objections from the GOP\u2019s deficit hawks who have pushed back against larger military spending.",
      "But Trump said he feels comfortable surging spending on the military because of increased revenue created by his administration through tariffs imposed on friends and foes around the globe since his return to office.",
      "The U.S. government collected gross revenues of $288.5 billion last year from tariffs and other excise taxes, up from $98.3 billion in 2024, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That\u2019s a meaningful increase in revenues from taxing imports. But it\u2019s not enough to cover the various promises made by Trump, who has said the tariffs can also cover dividends to taxpayers, pay down the national debt and, now, cover increased spending on the military.",

      "Nebraska lawmakers are considering a motion to expel Sen. Dan McKeon over allegations of inappropriate behavior",
      "LINCOLN, Neb. -- On the first day of the 2026 legislative session, Nebraska lawmakers were asked Wednesday to consider a motion to expel a fellow senator accused of making a sexually-charged comment to a legislative staffer and touching her inappropriately during a session-end party last year.",
      "If lawmakers vote next week to expel the 59-year-old Sen. Dan McKeon, a Republican in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature, it will be the first time the body has ever done so.",
      "The unprecedented move follows a complaint from the staffer that McKeon said she should \u201cget laid\u201d on her vacation and patted her on her buttocks last May during a party at the Lincoln Country Club attended by state lawmakers, staffers and lobbyists.",
      "More attention has focused on sexual harassment within state legislatures nationwide. At least 156 state lawmakers across 44 states have been accused of sexual harassment or misconduct since 2017, when The Associated Press began tracking such incidents amid the #MeToo movement. Of those, 56 have resigned or been expelled from office. A nearly equal number have faced some other type of repercussion, such as losing committee or party leadership positions.",
      "A report on the Nebraska complaint was compiled by an outside law firm at the request of the Legislature's Executive Board and released Wednesday. It found that McKeon has \u201ca reputation for making jokes and that some of those jokes are unprofessional and/or inappropriate for the workplace.\u201d",
      "The report determined that McKeon's conduct did not rise to a level of sexual harassment or retaliation that is actionable under state or federal discrimination law, but that didn't mean it was acceptable. It said McKeon's conduct did violate the Nebraska Legislature's workplace harassment policy, and that lawmakers \u201cmay, in their discretion, censure, reprimand or expel the senator for his conduct and comments.\u201d",
      "After interviewing the woman, McKeon and others, the attorney who wrote the report found that the woman, McKeon and another staffer had been discussing vacation plans at the May 29 party when McKeon asked whether the woman was \u201cgoing to Hawaii to get laid,\u201d she said. McKeon characterized the remark as a joke in which he said he hoped she would get a Hawaiian lei while in Hawaii.",
      "\u201cComplainant was not vacationing in Hawaii so this comment was inconsistent with the discussion of vacation plans,\u201d the report said.",
      "The staffer also said McKeon patted her behind. McKeon initially denied touching the woman, the report said, but later said he may have touched her back or lower back \u201cor even rear end,\u201d but insisted it was not intended to be sexual.",
      "The report also said that following the complaint, McKeon was instructed by Sen. Ben Hansen, chairman of the Executive Board, on June 2 not to attend social gatherings where staffers would be present. Despite this, McKeon attended another party that night also attended by staffers \u2014 including the woman who filed the complaint against him \u2014 according to the report.",
      "Nearly a month later, urged by Hansen to \u201caccept responsibility for what he was alleged to have done\u201d McKeon sent the woman a note telling her she should find it within herself to forgive him \u201cbecause that is what the Bible instructs people to do,\u201d the report said.",

      "McKeon, who attended Wednesday's opening session, declined to comment on the report itself. But his remarks on the complaint against him and the possibility of being expelled were in line with the report's findings, falling back on religious references by saying that his name, Daniel, means \u201cjust\u201d in Hebrew and remarking \u201cwe're all sinners\u201d when asked about accusations that he's often made inappropriate jokes in the workplace.",
      "He said he has no plans to step down, despite calls from leaders of his own party \u2014 including Republican Gov. Jim Pillen \u2014 to resign. But he seemed ready to accept that he might be forced out, saying he expects any vote in the full Legislature to \u201cbe pretty close.\u201d",

      "If McKeon is expelled, he would be the nation's 57th state lawmaker accused of sexual misconduct to have left office via expulsion or resignation since 2017.",

    "summary": "Nikki Glaser is hosting the Golden Globes for a second time and told CBS Mornings about the challenges of picking the perfect jokes.",
    "story": [
      "Comedian Nikki Glaser made history last year as the first woman to host the Golden Globes solo. She's returning this year to host the awards show for a second time.",
      "In an interview Tuesday with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Glaser described the process of making jokes for the awards show as \"strategic,\" saying, \"you have to be very delicate about making jokes that aren't going to ruin anyone's night, but you also want to give the people at home \u2026 something to laugh at and you want to poke fun at the people that they're dying for you to make fun of.\"",
      "She added picking the perfect jokes for the show is \"one of \u2026 the most difficult jobs I've ever done.\"",
      "Glaser said she is a big fan of the celebrities up for awards and said this year is a little different because she grew up admiring many of the actors.",
      "\"It is easy for me to take down like, you know, the newer batch of actresses and actors who are younger than me. It is like, OK I can make fun of you, I'm like a veteran. But when it's like people I grew up admiring it's \u2026 oh, my gosh, it is so much \u2026 it is a different approach this year.\"",
      "While preparing last year, Glaser reached out to some celebrities to see if a joke went too far. She said she hasn't done this yet so far and may have a different strategy.",
      "\"There are certain people that I don't know what I would say. It is almost like some of these jokes, you think about, OK, if I got their number, would I write them and ask them? Then I go, you know what? They might say no and I know the joke isn't that mean, and \u2026 I would rather ask for forgiveness later at the after-party when they're drunk,\" she said with a laugh.",
      "As Glaser rehearses, she's found one joke that doesn't always connect with the audience.",
      "\"I'm trying out my monologue around L.A. at the clubs here, and just even any joke about Julia Roberts, they're not there for. You cannot make fun of America's sweetheart,\" Glaser said. \"Whatever I end up saying about her, it is the most fine-tuned joke I have worked on so hard because it is very delicate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Countless young dancers have followed in the footsteps of Carmen de Lavallade, the Grande Dame of American dance who's among those receiving Kennedy Center honors in Washington tonight. She's been shattering barriers almost all her life, as Rita Braver now shows us:",
      "The elegant 86-year-old in pink putting young members of the Dance Theatre of Harlem through their paces (\"Lighten up!\") just happens to be one of the pioneers of American Modern Dance: Carmen de Lavallade.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it always that you have hoped that audiences would get from seeing you dance over the years?\"",
      "\"The connection,\" she replied. \"Because I don't feel that I'm there just dancing for myself, you know? I'm dancing for the audience.\"",
      "The remarkable journey of this California bricklayer's daughter is being saluted this weekend with a Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "It's a story that begins when even getting dance lessons was a challenge, as she described in her 2014 one-woman show: \"In those days, there were very few people who would take you if you were colored,\" she recalled. \"And if you did get into a dance studio, the white students would walk out.\"",
      "But her talent triumphed. While still in high school, de Lavallade won a place in a prestigious L.A. dance company. And she didn't go alone. She was joined by a high school friend who turned out to be a pretty good dancer himself: Alvin Ailey.",
      "De Lavallade introduced Ailey to the world of dance, and they were partners for years.",
      "In 1954 they were invited to perform in \"House of Flowers,\" an all-black Broadway show. But it was a cast member from Trinidad who won her heart: Geoffrey Holder. They were married within three months.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it about him that attracted you?\"",
      "\"I must say that he allowed me to be who I am. We didn't get in each other's way.\"",
      "Holder became a Tony Award-winning director (for \"The Wiz\") who often created both dances and costumes for his wife. The mementos of their life together are stored in a cavernous Harlem warehouse. \"I lived with this all my life,\" de Lavallade mused.",
      "Since Holder's death in 2014, de Lavallade  and her son, Leo, have been cataloging every piece -- letters, photos, costumes and clothes -- and recalling the stories that go with them, some of them bittersweet.",
      "In 1961 de Lavallade, by then an international sensation, was to appear on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "But she was not allowed to perform with the white dancer she was working with at the time.",
      "Braver asked, \"How did you feel when you were told that?\"",
      "\"You know, I wasn't surprised,\" she replied. \"It's not like today where, you know, you can get up and do all your protesting. It wasn't like that. You said, 'OK, move on.'\"",
      "And move on she did. She was one of the first black dancers at the Metropolitan Opera, where she also became a choreographer.\u00a0 And she joined the faculty of the Yale School of Drama, where she taught actors how to move.",
      "She is still performing. But she has never forgotten the lessons of history and the injustice she and other Black artists have faced",
      "And so, de Lavallade became one of the Kennedy Center Honorees who announced she would boycott the now-canceled White House reception after President Trump seemed to equate White nationalists who marched in Charlottesville with protesters who opposed them.",

      "Trump, first lady pull out of Kennedy Center Honors to avoid \"political distraction\" (CBS News, 08/19/17)",
      "\"I'm not political,\" she said. \"I have my own way of being political. That's the first time I've ever felt that I ... I just can't.\"",
      "Braver said, \"Some people would say, 'Well, even so, he's our president, and it's just fitting to go.'\"",
      "To which de Lavallade responded, \"I am 86 now. I have all these years, I have done what anybody asked me to, and this is the first time in my life I've ever said no. And I think at this time, it's my privilege.\"",
      "But Carmen de Lavallade will be there at tonight's Kennedy Center gala savoring her award for a life well-danced:",

    "summary": "The HBO Max drama immerses viewers in the struggles faced by the ER staff at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. \"Sunday Morning\" visits the hyper-realistic set, and talks with star, writer, director and executive producer Noah Wyle.",
    "story": [
      "Beginning in the 1960s, medical dramas became a staple of primetime TV. You may have followed the trials and tribulations of Doctors James Kildare, Marcus Welby, Hawkeye Pierce, Mark Craig, Michaela Quinn, and then, in 1994, \"ER\"'s Dr. John Carter, played by Noah Wyle.",
      "Wyle says that, when \"ER\" ended, the odds that someday he'd do another medical show were \"zero percent.\"",
      "So, what changed? \"COVID,\" he said. \"COVID changed everything, certainly for me in thinking about there being another story to tell. I was getting a lot of mail from people on the frontlines saying,'We could sure use Dr. Carter out here.' Or, 'This is really awful.'\"",
      "For his work on \"ER,\" Wyle was nominated as best supporting actor five times \u2026 and finally took home an Emmy this past September, when he received the trophy as outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his portrayal of Dr. Michael Robinavitch \u2013 Dr. Robby \u2013 on \"The Pitt.\" The hit HBO Max medical series won five Emmys in all, including outstanding drama series.",
      "And Season 2 is about to begin.",
      "Dr. Robby watches over the controlled chaos at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. It all takes place over a single emergency room shift, and each episode covers just one hour in a very long day.",
      "A few months ago, \"Sunday Morning\" visited the set at the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California. Walk from backstage into the emergency room, and you feel you are in an actual hospital.",
      "Wyle said, \"It became really important to have the entire set feel like a totally immersive experience. You open a drawer, everything that's supposed to be in the drawer is there. Everything feels real, and is exactly where it should go.\"",
      "Wyle is in charge here in more ways than one. Not only is he a lead actor; he's an executive producer and writer. And on the days we dropped in, he also directed.",
      "Actors at \"The Pitt\" have to learn more than their lines. There's a two-week medical boot camp. Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira, herself an emergency room doctor, is one of the show's medical technical consultants: \"We try our best to educate them on CPR, how to suture, how to intubate, the natural mechanics, so that when they are on screen and the camera is quite tight and close, everything looks finessed and refined, as if someone with experience has done it.\"",
      "She helps make sure the procedures look thoroughly real, as in Episode 10, involving a patient who'd been slugged in the eye by a baseball. She helps make sure the procedures \u2013 and the prosthetics \u2013 look thoroughly real.",
      "That hyper-authenticity extends to the storylines, as when a nurse is punched by a patient. Executive producers John Wells said, \"Since COVID, there's a kind of a stress level and anger that exists in the population. And that has translated particularly to violence against nurses, but against all the healthcare providers [as well].\"",
      "Wells and fellow executive producer Scott Gemmill \u2013 both veterans of the series \"ER\" \u2013 said \"The Pitt\" also addresses the issue of loss of trust that the public has in public health. \"Disinformation, that was one of the biggest changes, I think, besides COVID,\" Gemmill said. \"I don't remember the disinformation being at a level that it is these days.\"",
      "Wells said, \"The biggest thing that we talk about regularly is Dr. Google \u2013 this notion that everybody who comes in is already on their phone figuring out what it is that supposedly is wrong with them, and half the people have assumed that they've got the worst possible thing that could happen to them. And that's part of what the erosion of trust is. You're defending yourself against artificial intelligence and what's going to happen next.\"",
      "\"The Pitt\"'s second season will continue to reflect real life and real problems. Wyle said, \"People are going to lose their health insurance. People are going to delay care. People are going to continue to come in sicker. They're going to be more volatile when they come in. That's going to put more of a burden on staff. All this stuff is sort of moving towards this perfect storm of unsustainability.\"",
      "Wyle's connection to the medical community is more than what's in a script: his mother, Marjorie Speer, was an orthopedic and operating room nurse. \"Mom's at the hospital all day, I got to walk home from school until mom gets home,\" Wyle said. \"And then 35 years later, she's watching an episode of 'The Pitt,' and comes over and says, 'That rocked me.' She just starts listing all these names of patients that she had seen die when she was practicing. I said, 'Mom, I've never heard these stories before.' And she goes, 'Oh, yeah.' We were her kids, and she didn't show us that stuff.\"",
      "But \"The Pitt\" does show us that stuff, and what happens when an empathetic doctor stops having empathy for himself.",
      "\"You know, in the old days, it was kind of 'suck it up,' and it was a little bit of like, 'I went through it, so you got to go through it,' you know? This is your training,\" Wyle said.",
      "\"We were up for four days straight!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! And it became a badge of honor to survive it.\"",
      "Gemmill said, \"We get feedback from people who, having seen the show, realize that they, too, are suffering and have buried it the same way that the Robby character did.\"",
      "Which brings us to Dr. Robinavitch's meltdown. \"Everything is going crazy. We need the hero to come in on his white horse and save the day,\" Wyle said. \"He's on the floor! \u00a0The hero's on the floor? How can that be?\"",
      "So, three decades after \"ER,\" Noah Wyle is once again playing a dedicated doctor \u2013 and as it turns out, it's a prescription he wrote for himself. \"There were two points in my career. during the pandemic and during this last work stoppage for the writers and actors' strike, those were the two moments when the flow of my career [was] interrupted, and I wasn't used to it,\" he said. \"It really rattled me in a way that \u2026 that rattled me. I remember saying to my wife, like, 'I don't think I work for money. I think I work for health, my own health. Like, I think this is where I get my orientation. And without it, I'm not sure I know what I do on this Earth.'\"",
      "And now? \u00a0\"I'm the happiest I've been in a long time,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Does that surprise you?\"",
      "\"It just confirms, you know, it confirms all my worst suspicions about myself, which is that I really need all this!\" Wyle laughed.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:16:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers in \"Sinners,\" says shooting Ryan Coogler's horror film set in the Depression Era South \u2013 a drama that melds Jim Crow racism with vampires \u2013 is also a testament to the power of family.",
    "story": [
      "It's not much of a stretch to say that Michael B. Jordan has fought his way to the top. His performances are often game-changing \u2013 as a boxing champ (in \"Creed\"), a Marvel superhero (in \"Fantastic Four\"), or a Marvel villain (in \"Black Panther\").",
      "But his latest film required a different kind of superpower: In Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners,\" Jordan plays twin brothers, Stack and Smoke, who open a backwoods honkytonk in the segregated South.",
      "When Coogler shared the idea of him playing two different characters, Jordan says his reaction was, \"'I'm a do what?' I think it was a little bit of anxiety, I think. A little bit nerves. But then, equal amount of excitement.\"",
      "And it gets really exciting when vampires show up. \"Sinners\" is a horror film, but it's also about history, and the power of family ties.",
      "To play characters from the Jim Crow South, Jordan drew a bit from his own family history. Relatives on his mother's side hail from Hope, Arkansas, but years ago moved to a segregated Black neighborhood in Los Angeles called Oakwood (a place that is now Venice Beach).",
      "We visited the First Baptist Church of Venice, which was the center of their community, and one of the only remnants still standing. Jordan, who moved to New Jersey as a toddler, never went to this place of worship, but he says he can still feel the connection to his family's past. \"I grew up in church, you know, very spiritual family,\" he said. \"Churches were, like, safe havens \u2013 places of prayer and refuge \u2026 The history, I mean, you can feel the weight when you walk into a place like this.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did shooting 'Sinners' make you think about your own family history more?\"",
      "\"Big time,\" he replied. \"It definitely connected me back to my family's history that I've always had a strong connection with, but it just kind of reframed it a bit.\"",
      "His own history is remarkable as well: Dad is a U.S. Marine veteran; mom is a former high school counselor; and Michael Bakari Jordan was a child model, then a child star. He was still in high school when he was cast in the landmark series \"The Wire,\" and a few years later in another landmark show, \"Friday Night Lights.\"",
      "He said, \"There's nobody in my family that came from this, I guess, that looked at it as a potential career, you know? I think once I didn't go to college and I decided to move to California and pursue acting full-time, there was, like, there was no turning back after that one.\"",
      "His film breakout came in 2013 in director Ryan Coogler's drama \"Fruitvale Station.\"",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Michael B. Jordan, Ryan Coogler on \"Fruitvale Station\" (YouTube Video)",
      "Jordan worked with Coogler again a few years later when he climbed into the ring for 2015's \"Creed,\" a spin-off of the \"Rocky\" franchise \u2013 and, by the way, the first Rocky film where Sylvester Stallone didn't have top billing.",
      "Jordan said, \"Doing 'Creed,' so many different levels. The first time I transform my body, you know, learned a skill that I continue to do today, you know?\"",
      "\"You still box?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it's a part of me at this point,\" he said.",
      "And this character of Erik Killmonger, the bad guy in \"Black Panther\" who tried to dethrone the hero played by the late Chadwick Boseman, stuck with him, too, but not in a good way. He says it was hard to shake Erik. \"Yes, it kind of stuck with me for a bit. And, you know, went to therapy and talked about it. Found a way to kind of just decompress, I think at that point still learning that I needed to decompress from a character.\"",
      "\"So, you literally went to therapy to help rid yourself a little bit of Erik?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. And then I think that spiraled into a bigger conversation and self-discovery of, like, 'Okay, you know, I think that's something that's necessary for people, you know?' Especially men. I think it's good for them to go and talk. That's something I'm not ashamed of at all, and very proud of. And definitely helped me trying to be a good communicator and a well-rounded person, inside and out.\"",
      "For Jordan, now 38, part of being well-rounded is a strong relationship with mom and dad. He even continued to live with his parents up until well after he could afford to move out on his own. \"This is true,\" he said.",
      "Why? \"I mean, 'cause I love my parents. You know, I love them. Made for a lotta funny moments, lotta great stories.\"",
      "Like? \u00a0\"Y'all ain't got enough time!\" he laughed. \"I'm a night owl, you know? Like, just things, you know? They go to sleep early. Insert moment here.\"",
      "We should mention Jordan bought them a house of their own in the L.A. suburbs; he just lived there for a while.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to buy your parents a house, you know, your mom a house? It's like, that's always been the childhood dream, is to retire your parents and them not having to work anymore,\" he said. \"And I can say I did that. So that's, like, yeah, that's a bucket list.\"",
      "\"Sinners\" is squarely in the Oscar conversation, both for the film and for Jordan's performance. It's a welcome distinction for someone who lived his early life under the shadow of another famous Michael.",
      "\"You grew up playing sports, right?\" I asked. \"Was the name Michael Jordan a problem?\"",
      "\"Big time!\" he said. \"I got teased so much, to the point where I almost changed my name.\"",
      "He was going to lean on his middle name: Bakari Jordan. \"It definitely made me want to be competitive and be good at \u2013 I wanted to be great at something, if not for nothing else at that time just to, like, feel like I had my own identity,\" he said.",
      "I said, \"But there could be another Michael Jordan who could make his mark.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" said Jordan. \"That was a part of the alchemy that made me who I am today.\"",
      "Put it this way: Michael Bakari Jordan could be on his way to his own brand of immortality \u2013 after all, Bakari means \"noble promise.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel like you've fulfilled that?\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm walking in that,\" Jordan replied, \"and will continue to do so, big time. We got a lot more things to do, you know? We're just getting started.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Environmental journalist Tatiana Schlossberg (May 5, 1990-Dec. 30, 2025), a grandchild of President John F. Kennedy, worked as a reporter for The New York Times' Science section, and was author of the award-winning 2019 book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have.\"",
      "In a November 2025 essay in The New Yorker, titled \"A Battle With My Blood,\" she wrote of how her life changed, shockingly, upon the birth of her second child in May 2024 at age 34. Hours after giving birth, Schlossberg's doctors noticed a spike in her white-blood-cell count. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, mostly seen in older people. \"I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,\" she wrote.",
      "The daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, she recounted in her essay going through rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants and participating in clinical trials. During the most recent trial, she wrote, her doctor told her \"he could keep me alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good,\" she wrote, \"to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\"",
      "In her essay, Schlossberg criticized her mother's cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for pushing policies (including slashing nearly $500 million for research into mRNA vaccines against certain cancers) that could impact patients like her. She also wrote movingly of her family's support, and of the valiant efforts of medical staff to help her. \"I have never encountered a group of people who are more competent, more  full of grace and empathy, more willing to serve others than nurses,\" she wrote. \"Nurses should take over.\"",
      "She feared her daughter and son wouldn't remember her, and mourned the life and work she would not experience \u2013 from watching her children grow up, to writing a book about the oceans.",
      "\"Mostly, I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go,\" she wrote. \"So many of them are from my childhood that I feel as if I'm watching myself and my kids grow up at the same time. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't. But since I don't know what death is like and there's no one to tell me what comes after it, I'll keep pretending. I will keep trying to remember.\""

      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",

      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",

      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",

      "The doctor's health handbook does include the basics of what to eat, how to exercise, and the all-important reminder that sleep is fundamental to wellness. But it goes beyond that, with behaviors that include \"Don't be a schmuck.\"",
      "\"One of the things that is I think core to the book is, stop doing things that aren't good for your health,\" Emanuel said. \"'Don't be a schmuck' is my father's reference to us when we were being stupid. And so, there are lots of things that we do as human beings that can be schmucky: smoking, vaping, doing drugs, not taking your vaccines. I don't agree with the current administration, and they're dead wrong on this.\"",
      "Also on the so-called schmuck list: alcohol.",
      "I asked, \"This is what everybody wants to know about: the right amount of alcohol, or no alcohol?\"",
      "Emanuel said, \"There has been a lot of research on alcohol, so here's the way I distill it: The safest level is probably zero. There are some studies, and we should be clear, where it's half a cup a day, three cups a week.\"",
      "\"Nobody drinks a half a glass of wine,\" I said.",
      "\"So, you drink every other day,\" Emanuel said. \"On the other hand, 60, 65% of the public drinks. You're not going from 65% to zero. So, you have to give people reasonable advice. And the reasonable advice is, first of all, no binge drinking, that's really bad for you. Don't drink alone. That's really bad for you. If you're using alcohol as a lubricant for social interaction, which many people do, that's probably good; you're getting some benefit from the social interaction.\"",
      "Social interactions \u2013 a consistent theme for Emanuel \u2013 is something he learned at a young age, growing up with brother Ari, a super-agent in Hollywood, and his other brother Rahm, the former mayor of Chicago and ambassador, who may be running for president of the United States.",
      "I asked, \"What is it that your parents taught all of you that has led you, I mean, you're all incredibly successful?\"",
      "\"Now you're gonna make me cry,\" Emanuel said, \"because every time I talk about my parents and our growing up, I tend to cry. They taught us how to be social and interact with people. They also taught us how to be responsible. One of the things my mom did in raising us is, you know, get out of the house and go occupy yourself. Rahm and I went to school, I was six in first grade, and he was in nursery school. I had to take him from school, walk two blocks across a busy street, get on a bus, pay the car fare, get off at the right spot. I learned a huge amount of responsibility, taking care of my brothers.",
      "\"The other thing I think they did, which was super-important for us, is we all slept in the same bedroom. We were a unit. Yes, we fought endlessly. And you know, I like to joke with people, we didn't go to bed until there was blood, you know, because of all the fights. But we were also each other's best friends.\"",
      "His takeaway: relationships matter.",
      "Emanuel also lists lifestyle choices he considers \"anti-wellness,\" like chronic stress, a fast-food diet, social media, and dining alone.",
      "\"I think people would agree with all of those, with the exception of dining alone,\" I said. \"A lot of people go to a restaurant or get home from work, and dine alone.\"",
      "Emanuel said that should be an occasional thing: \"Don't make it every day. And you know, if you find yourself dining alone, what you should do is call up a friend. If you're sitting at a bar, right, and you're dining there, ask the person next to you, you know, 'Have you been to this restaurant before? What do you do? Why are you here?' Yeah, strike up a conversation. We underplay those casual conversations and how important they are for us.\"",
      "His book also discusses retirement: \"Retirement leads to more rapid cognitive decline for people. I say to people, don't retire. And if you're gonna retire, you have to plan retirement well, so that you stay engaged, you stay mentally sharp. And that doesn't mean, 'Well, you know, I'm gonna try to play the saxophone one day.'\"",
      "\"But Dr. Emanuel, a lot of retired people like to buy books, and watch 'Sunday Morning,'\" I said.",
      "\"Well, if they're buying books and staying mentally engaged that way, if they're going to volunteer, say, or they're talking to friends, or they're taking up a new hobby seriously, all of that is excellent, highly endorsed,\" he replied.",
      "\"Meaning don't retire the mind, or retire your social engagement?\"",
      "\"Yes, and it's very important, you've got to be deliberate about it. You can't let nature take its course.\"",
      "So, what is his biggest piece of advice for us in 2026? \"Build your social relationships,\" he said. \"It's definitely the most important thing for long-lasting health and happiness.\"",

      "In his new book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and health policy expert, discusses longevity, and how to best differentiate valid and effective health and wellness advice from \"the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Emanuel on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 4!",
      "\"Eat Your Ice Cream\" by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D.",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Anyone looking for advice on wellness and longevity confronts a tsunami of books, newspaper articles, podcasts, newsletters, and videos from an enormous range of sources: scientific experts, medical practitioners, health systems, journalists, patients, influencers, gurus, quacks. Traditional media offer loads of good advice, often in responsibly edited and well-sourced sections dedicated to \"wellness.\" But the sheer amount of it can be difficult to keep up with, and sometimes the guidance can be downright contradictory.",
      "For anyone wading through the torrent of health and longevity advice online, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The so-called \"must dos\" online range from the medically unproven to the wildly impractical to suggestions so absurd they leave doctors like me baffled\u2014testicle tanning, teen blood transfusions, vaginal steaming, \"rucking\" hikes with a backpack full of weights. Information is coming at us from a firehose, increasingly spewed by hucksters and self-proclaimed sages who have amassed millions of social media followers (and dollars) by promising supposed miracle treatments using medical-sounding language. It's no wonder so many people are confused and frustrated.",
      "Shouting to be heard over it all are real physicians and health experts offering sound but sometimes conflicting advice. All of it together can swamp even those who are most assiduous about their health. Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Thursday that he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he argued would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
      "Mr. Trump and the White House have been trying to show they are responding to voter concerns about affordability ahead of midterm elections in November. Home prices have generally risen faster than incomes because of a persistent construction shortfall, making it harder for renters to buy their first home and for existing owners to upgrade to a new property \u2014 a challenge that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and the recovery from the housing market collapse that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "Mr. Trump last month said he planned to unveil housing reforms \u2014 and on Wednesday, he announced that he\u00a0wants to block institutional investors from buying houses.",
      "The president said Thursday that the two mortgage giants under government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have $200 billion in cash that will be used to make the mortgage bond purchases.",
      "\"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "Federal Housing Finance Authority Director Bill Pulte, who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said on X the two government-run companies \"will be executing\" the president's request.",
      "The Federal Reserve has, in the past, bought mortgage bonds during times of economic turmoil in order to help reduce interest rates, leading many homeowners to refinance into rates of 3% or less. The low rates of the recent past make these homeowners reluctant to sell their properties, depriving the market of inventory.",
      "Additional mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie could temporarily help lower mortgage costs, but that approach also could have unintended consequences, according to TD Securities analysts.",
      "\"We see this succeeding in the short term, though we believe it will reignite home prices' inflation given supply constraints,\" they said in a research note, alluding to a severe shortage of affordable housing in the U.S.",
      "Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate brokerage Redfin, estimated to the Associated Press that the government purchases of mortgage debt could shave 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points off the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. But she also cautioned that the purchases wouldn't address other factors driving high housing costs, like limited supply.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the\u00a0U.S. are unaffordable\u00a0for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site. Property data firm ATTOM found Thursday that in the last three months of 2025, median-priced single-family homes were less affordable than historical averages in 99% of the nearly 600 U.S. counties the company analyzed.",
      "Mortgage rates have been averaging around 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, which went into federal conservatorship along with Fannie Mae in 2008 when the U.S. economy crashed during the Great Recession. Thirty-year mortgage rates haven't been below 6% since September 2022.",
      "Mortgage rates began to climb as inflation spiked coming out of the global pandemic, with the consumer price index hitting a four-decade high in 2022. The average mortgage rate is down from nearly 7% at the start of Mr. Trump's second term last year, yet the decrease has done little to reassure a public that feels pressure from the costs of housing, food and energy.",
      "When interest rates fall it can become cheaper to service housing debt on a monthly basis. The reduced monthly payments can improve affordability for a period until home prices adjust in response to changes in the rates. There was roughly $21.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt as of the middle of last year, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.",
      "Many homeowners took advantage of low interest rates during the pandemic to refinance their mortgages at rates of 3% or lower.",
      "The plan to buy up hundreds of billions in mortgage bonds could also carry some risk for Fannie and Freddie because Mr. Trump would be spending the cash reserves that are supposed to help be a buffer against an economic downturn akin to what happened during the Great Recession. In a sense, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could be more vulnerable if anything negative happens to the housing market, meaning Mr. Trump is betting that possibility is highly unlikely.",
      "Fannie and Freddie work by buying up scores of residential mortgages and repackaging them as mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors. Collectively, they guarantee trillions of dollars' worth of mortgages.",
      "In the past, the president has pushed to take Fannie and Freddie public. Supporters argue that move could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, but critics warn it may push up mortgage rates by raising uncertainty about the two megafirms.",
      "But on Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to rethink that plan, writing: \"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount \u2014 AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE \u2014 and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH.\"",

    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines said that it will no longer carry out migrant deportation flights for the Department of Homeland Security, ending a contract that supported the U.S. government's immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "The Houston-based carrier, founded in 2021, said its deal to handle Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights did not sufficiently boost the airline's financial position. As a result, the low-cost carrier is shutting down its hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where its migrant flight operation was based, the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Avelo will close the base at [Mesa Gateway Airport] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,\" an Avelo spokesperson said. \"The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.\"",
      "Avelo operates low-cost flights to dozens of destinations, including the Caribbean, from four U.S. hubs. It is planning to open a fifth base in Dallas in late 2026.",
      "DHS has long partnered with CSI Aviation, which subcontracted with Avelo to provide ICE with air charter services. The federal agency also subcontracts with other charter companies, including GlobalX, which handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "\"ICE never contracted directly with Avelo Airlines,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News. \"ICE will continue to utilize its contracted service provider, which works with multiple airlines to support the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "In April, Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy expressed confidence that the airline's deportation business would help drive the carrier's growth, while conceding that handling deportation flights was a \"sensitive and complicated topic.\"",
      "Mesa's charter program has sparked public backlash and protests against its decision to work with ICE.",
      "The Indivisible Project, a nonprofit group that led protests against Avelo Airlines, on Thursday applauded the carrier's move to end its contract with DHS.",
      "\"For months, communities across the country spoke out, organized, protested and demanded that Avelo Airlines end its deportation flights.

    "summary": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board again urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's offer, calling it inferior to Netflix's bid",
    "story": [
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors on Wednesday rejected Paramount Skydance's revised hostile bid, saying that its terms are inferior to Warner's $82.7 billion merger agreement with Netflix.",
      "\"Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders,\" Warner Bros. Discovery's board said in a statement.",
      "The rebuff is the second from Warner Bros. Discovery of Paramount Skydance's efforts to acquire the storied studio, which has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and owns cable networks including CNN and TNT.",
      "Paramount Skydance, the parent company of CBS News, owns the Paramount studios and cable networks including Comedy Central and Nickelodeon.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery in December rebuffed Paramount Skydance's most recent hostile bid, citing a lack of personal backing from the Ellison family.",
      "Paramount Skydance later returned with an improved offer that included a personal guarantee from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison \u2014 the father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison \u2014 for $40.4 billion in equity financing.",
      "But on Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery turned down the latest offer as well, stating that Paramount Skydance's bid posed \"significant costs, risks and uncertainties\" compared with the Netflix merger. Warner Bros. Discovery also said Paramount Skydance's offer would burden the combined company with significant debt.",
      "On Thursday, January 8, Paramount Skydance said it is sticking with its current offer, reiterating the company's belief that the bid is \"superior to WBD's existing agreement with Netflix.\"",
      "\"Our offer clearly provides WBD investors greater value and a more certain, expedited path to completion,\" David Ellison said in a statement. \"Throughout this process, we have worked hard for WBD shareholders and remain committed to engaging with them on the merits of our superior bid and advancing our ongoing regulatory review process.\"",
      "Netflix on Wednesday said it \"welcomed\" Warner Bros. Discovery's ongoing commitment to the companies' merger. The streaming service added that it has submitted its Hart-Scott-Rodino filing with U.S. agencies, which is required for a review of potential antitrust issues.",
      "Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO network, as well as its streaming and studios business, for $27.75 a share. Under the deal, Warner's cable division would be spun off into a separately run unit before the merger is completed.",
      "Netflix's bid includes $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50. Paramount Skydance is offering $30 a share to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery, valuing the offer at roughly $108 billion.",

    "story": [
      "Google on Thursday unveiled new artificial intelligence features in Gmail, an effort by the technology giant to refresh its 22-year-old messaging app amid growing use of AI.",
      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",
      "Google is offering paid Pro and Ultra subscribers access to technology that lets users ask natural-language questions directly in the Gmail search bar. Subscribers will also have access to a dedicated chatbot for follow-up questions.",
      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",
      "Meanwhile, the so-called\u00a0 \"Catch me up\" tool will provide users with reminders of their upcoming events and appointments. This includes but is not limited to upcoming reservations, purchases and deliveries, and cancelled or rescheduled appointments.",
      "How to opt out",
      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section. Users should then uncheck \"Turn on smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet,\" and then save their changes.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Postal Service said some mail might no longer receive a same-day postmark, the result of cost cuts to its transportation operations that may delay the arrival of posted letters at its processing facilities.",
      "The change could prove a stumbling block for people who need to ensure that mail such as bill payments, taxes or voting ballots are postmarked by specific dates. For instance, state and federal quarterly estimated taxes typically must be postmarked by January 15, April 15, June 15 and September 15 to avoid late fees.",
      "The change is part of the postal agency's 10-year plan to reduce costs and restore profitability. USPS' loss narrowed slightly in its most recent fiscal year, shrinking from $9.5 billion in 2024 to\u00a0$9 billion last year, but it continues to struggle with high costs and dwindling mail volumes.",

      "Annual tax refunds are typically the largest checks that households receive each year, with last year's average payment amounting to almost $3,200, according to IRS data. This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check set to increase by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis.",
      "2025 tax returns will be impacted by a number of major changes signed into law through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act, which enacted a host of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025. These include eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "Federal income tax returns are due April 15, although people who need more time can file for an\u00a0automatic tax extension before that. An extension gives taxpayers until Oct. 15 to file, although any taxes owed must still be paid by April 15 to avoid penalties.",
      "When will you get your refund?",
      "The question on most taxpayers' minds is how long it will take for their refund to be deposited.",
      "That depends on whether a taxpayer files electronically or submits a paper return, as well as whether the IRS identifies any problems with a filing.",

      "\"Swings in trade of gold and pharmaceuticals were behind the plunge in the trade deficit to a two-decade low in October, though higher computer imports suggest there are genuine signs of strength elsewhere in the economy amid the AI buildout,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "The release of the trade data was delayed by more than a month due to a 43-day\u00a0government shutdown last year, depriving officials and companies of updated figures as they assess the health of the world's biggest economy.",
      "The figures underscore how Mr. Trump's volatile and sweeping tariff policies have influenced trade flows. When the president unveiled wide-ranging tariffs on imports from dozens of trading partners, U.S. businesses rushed to stock up on inventory, front-loading imports ahead of planned tariff hikes.",

      "\"It is an idea that appeals to MAGA populists and is a policy that Vice President J.D. Vance has consistently supported,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen, said in a research note. \"That it comes now is an indicator of how worried Team Trump is worried about the impact of housing affordability on the midterm election.\"",
      "Seiberg expects both the House and Senate to pass bipartisan bills to implement Mr. Trump's order. \"We appreciate that many important congressional Republicans have opposed this in the past. Our view is that they will concede on this issue rather than fight the president,\" he added.",
      "Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "The analysis also noted that institutional ownership varies nationwide, reaching 4.2% in Atlanta, 2.6% in Dallas and 2.2% in Houston. But these investors tend not to dominate neighborhoods, even if they're generally more concentrated in lower- and middle-income communities.",
      "Impact on home prices and rent",
      "Still, the recent rise of institutional investors purchasing single-family homes can have negative spillover effects for consumers, research shows.",
      "In 2024, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0found that institutional investment can increase rents and home prices, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Advocates for policies benefiting property owners said they would support policies that block large investors from scooping up properties.",
      "\"We are very glad to see that the administration is squarely focusing on housing and housing affordability,\" Colin Allen, executive director of the American Property Owners Alliance,\u00a0 a nonpartisan advocacy group, told CBS News. \"Each home that is taken off the market by an institutional investor is one less for an owner-occupant to try to move into at a time when there is a lot of competition for homes for sale.\"",
      "More than 75% of homes across the U.S. are unaffordable for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site.",
      "Data from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of home purchases in 2024 were made by first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010. Housing economists also point to a severe shortage of inventory for the soaring cost of homes in recent years.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts in October estimated the U.S. would need to add 3 million to 4 million homes above the normal pace of construction levels to help ease residential real estate prices.",
      "A better solution?",
      "Some experts are skeptical that Mr. Trump's proposal to restrict investor ownership of single-family homes would help ease housing costs for Americans.",
      "Institutional investors contribute to the housing supply by buying and renovating derelict homes, and then putting them back on the market, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "A ban on real estate trusts, private equity firms and other housing market investors from buying homes could also have unintended consequences by discouraging such players from selling their existing properties, he added.",
      "A better way to create affordable housing, Pinto said, is to make more efficient use of the nation's existing housing stock by allowing homeowners to rent out unused rooms tax-free, and also by incentivizing states to build more homes.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon customers can now file a claim under its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which resolved allegations of deceptive enrollment practices in the retailer's Prime shopping service.",
      "As part of the September 2025 settlement, Amazon is offering $1.5 billion in refunds to eligible customers, as well as paying a $1 billion civil penalty. The FTC had alleged that Amazon duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it hard for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations as part of the settlement. Here's what to know.",
      "How do you file a claim in the Amazon Prime FTC settlement?",
      "Amazon customers should go to the settlement website to file their claim. Although millions of eligible customers will receive automatic payments through the settlement without filing a claim, some will need to submit one, the site notes.",
      "Customers eligible for automatic payments are those who signed up for Prime through what the FTC calls a \"challenged enrollment flow,\" including pages such as Amazon's shipping selection page and its single-page checkout. Consumers who used three or fewer Prime benefits within a 12-month period are also due for refunds without submitting a claim.",
      "Prime benefits include services such as free two-day shipping, Prime Video streaming and Amazon Music.",
      "If you signed up for Prime through a \"challenged enrollment flow\" between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, and you used Prime benefits between three and 10 times in a 12-month period, you may need to file a claim to get money under the settlement.",
      "Eligible customers who need to file a claim will receive an email or a mailed notice, according to the settlement website.",
      "What information do you need to file a claim?",
      "The settlement site says you'll need to provide the requested information, which includes a claim ID and PIN provided in the email or mailing sent to customers. You'll also have to sign and submit the claim before July 21.",
      "How much money will Amazon customers receive?",
      "People who qualify can receive a refund of their Amazon Prime membership fees, up to $51, according to the settlement site.",
      "However, some customers may see smaller amounts if, for instance, they signed up for a trial membership that charged less than the regular Prime fee, the site notes.",
      "When will you get the Amazon Prime refund?",
      "Customers will be contacted by email or mail (postmarked by January 23) to inform them if they are eligible, according to the settlement site.",
      "Consumers will then have 180 days to submit a claim, and Amazon will review each claim within 30 days of receiving it. Payments should \"follow shortly after approval of your claims form,\" the site adds.",
      "How will the Amazon Prime refunds be issued?",
      "The refunds will be sent through PayPal, Venmo or mailed checks, according to the settlement site. People who file claims can specify their preferred payment method.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-airlines-pilot-jet-panel-blew-out-sues-boeing/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Alaska Airlines pilot who has been universally praised as a hero for safely landing a jet after a door plug panel flew off shortly after takeoff is suing Boeing because he believes the plane maker wrongly tried to blame him and the rest of the crew.",
      "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended by the heads of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration and even Boeing executives for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
      "But Fisher's lawyers say Boeing's attempts to deflect liability in past lawsuits despite what the NTSB investigation found led to the pilot being sued by some passengers and caused him great distress. Still, experts say it's unusual for a pilot to sue like this in an incident where he wasn't seriously hurt or killed. Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit says Boeing suggested it wasn't responsible because the plane was \"improperly maintained or misused\" by others.",
      "\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummolo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court.",
      "Key bolts were missing",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The bolts are hidden behind interior panels in the plane, so they are not something that could have been easily checked in a preflight inspection by the pilot or anyone else from the airline. NTSB investigators determined the door plug was gradually moving upward over the 154 flights prior to the incident before it ultimately flew off.",
      "\"Boeing's lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\" Fisher's lawyers wrote. \"Because he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing's attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\"",
      "The NTSB made clear this was caused by a manufacturing issue and the crew's actions were exemplary. Experienced pilot John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems aviation safety consulting firm, said the crew did a remarkable job considering what they were dealing with, and no one has faulted the crew.",
      "\"I think the Boeing lawyers were kind of grasping at straws,\" Cox said.",
      "Terrifying moments",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane landed safely.",
      "\"The first indication was an explosion in my ears and then a whoosh of air,\" First Officer Emily Wiprud told CBS News in an exclusive interview in 2024. \"My body was forced forward and there was a loud bang as well. ... The flight deck door was open. I saw tubes hanging from the cabin.\"",
      "Wiprud said that at that point, she didn't know what was wrong. Instinct took over, and she and the captain started working to land safely.",
      "\"I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,\" Wiprud said. \"I knew something was catastrophically wrong.\"",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot piece of fuselage covering an unused emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "A teen aboard the flight\u00a0had his shirt ripped off his body.\u00a0 Multiple objects, including the\u00a0phones of two passengers, Wiprud's headset and multiple aircraft components, were sucked out of the aircraft.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs they weren't qualified for.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit describes how he and the first officer acted quickly after losing cabin pressure when the panel blew out to fly the plane safely back to Portland while decreasing altitude and working with air traffic controllers to avoid any other planes in the area.",
      "The airline didn't answer a question about whether Fisher is still flying for them, and the lawsuit described him as a citizen and well-respected member of the aviation community. It wasn't clear Tuesday whether he is still working as a pilot.",
      "Working to improve safety",
      "The head of the commercial airplane unit at Boeing at the time, Stan Deal, commended the Alaska Airlines crew for safely landing the plane in a memo to employees after the incident.",
      "Boeing did not comment directly on this new lawsuit. But the company's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has made improving safety a top priority ever since he took over the top job at Boeing in August 2024.",
      "The FAA fined Boeing $3.1 million over safety violations inspectors found after the door plug incident. In October, the agency allowed Boeing to increase production of the 737 Max to 42 planes a month because inspectors were satisfied with the measures the company had taken to improve safety.",
      "Alaska Airlines also declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said the airline remains \"grateful to our crew members for the bravery and quick-thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"",

      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",

Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew.

It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Polymarket wager could violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), a federal law regulating futures and options trading, experts told CBS News. Specifically, the CEA prohibits gambling on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.",
      "Kelleher also said the incident highlights the potential risks for other prediction market users.",
      "\"Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,\" he said.",
      "Piepgrass told CBS News that the Maduro bet marks a \"flashpoint\" in the debate around what he characterized as inadequate regulation of such markets. Enabling insiders with access to confidential information to place bets on the trading forums would disadvantage other customers, he said.",
      "\"It's about fundamental fairness,\" Piepgrass said. \"Do you want to be placing bets in an area where some people have information directly relevant to winning that bet, but you do not? If you are a consumer, you have to really question, is that a market you want to participate in.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:36:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Travel insurance won't help most people whose flights were disrupted by the turmoil in Venezuela. Here's what such policies do cover.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of people were stranded abroad because their flights home were scrapped after the U.S. temporarily shut down airspace around Venezuela following the capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Some travellers remain stuck because airlines rebooked them on flights that don't leave for days, while others face thousands of dollars in extra travel-related expenses, such as lodging costs. Now, industry experts are advising them to ask airlines for refunds and, for those with travel insurance, to file a claim.",
      "On Saturday, the day of the attack, roughly 1,130 flights within, into or out of the U.S., were cancelled, hundreds of which were scheduled to depart from Aruba, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and other Caribbean islands, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Airlines have since resumed service in the region after the flight restrictions were lifted.",
      "What travel insurance doesn't cover",
      "If you're already on a trip, of course, it's too late to purchase travel insurance.",
      "\"It's like buying car insurance after you hit a tree,\" Suzanne Morrow, CEO of InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site, told CBS News.",
      "Even if you have coverage, meanwhile, there are limitations. Most travel policies include exclusions that might apply to trip interruptions of the sort that led to the now-lifted restrictions on Caribbean airspace. That can make it hard for purchasers of travel insurance to know if a policy will protect them.",
      "\"Coverage decisions are based on policy language and official determinations. My recommendation is to save all of your receipts for every expense incurred,\" Morrow said.",
      "Specifically, most policies expressly exclude coverage when a policyholder's trip is disrupted due to an act of war, terrorism, or civil unrest, she noted. Such determinations are based on airlines' stated reasons for cancelling flights.",
      "As a result, payouts for delayed trips might not\u00a0apply to the Venezuela flight restrictions, Jeff Rolander, vice president of claims and customer experience at Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers have been assessing the situation to determine if coverage will apply, and acts of war are a general exclusion under all travel insurance policies,\" he said.",
      "What travel insurance does cover",
      "People who bought travel insurance are generally entitled to compensation when an airline cancels a flight because of a mechanical issue or other problem within the carrier's control.",
      "\"Standard travel insurance policies are designed to protect against baggage loss or flight delays due to an airline issue,\" said Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at Square Mouth, a travel insurance comparison site.",
      "The policies can also protect travellers if they need to cancel trips for personal emergencies, such as illness or injury.",
      "Many travel insurance providers also offer add-ons that provide coverage for trips that are interrupted for \"any reason,\" but such an upgrade has to be purchased in advance.",
      "Valdez said some fliers could be eligible for compensation for a cancelled flight if the rebooked flight is cancelled due to an airline issue.",
      "\"Sometimes, because of airspace closures, airlines are trying to catch up and there may not be aircraft available. Mechanical issues could prevent them from adding additional aircraft to the fleet, and those kinds of things could still be covered,\" she said.",
      "The average cost of travel insurance is around $21 a day, according to Square Mouth. A policy's pricing is based on trip costs and the breadth of coverage.",
      "Always file a claim",
      "For travellers whose flights are cancelled, Morrow said the first course of action beyond saving receipts should be to file a claim with their airline for any added expenses. Those costs could include meals, lodging and other costs incurred as a result of a flight cancellation.",
      "\"Go through the process, whether or not they cover anything. At least make the effort to get compensation, particularly if you don't have insurance,\" she advised.",
      "If you do have travel coverage, your provider can also help with rebooking flights and finding alternate accommodations in the interim.",
      "\"Travel insurance does so much more than reimburse for expenses. It also comes with assistance benefits that can help when trips are interrupted,\" Morrow said.",

      "The meeting is expected to take place Wednesday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who is attending the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference in Miami, a Department of Energy spokesperson said.",
      "The meetings come as President Trump pushes U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela's oil industry, following the U.S. military's capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday.",
      "Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil industry has languished after years of mismanagement, underinvestment and tight U.S. sanctions. The country produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to OPEC, most of which is exported to China \u2014 representing less than 1% of global oil production.",
      "Chevron is the only major U.S. petroleum company that currently operates in Venezuela under a special license from the Treasury Department. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007, after Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, demanded that Venezuela's state-run oil company take majority stakes in the country's oil ventures.",
      "It remains uncertain whether U.S. firms will reinvest in Venezuela right away. Experts say it would take companies years to build out their operations in Venezuela, and many oil companies could tread lightly because of political uncertainty.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said: \"All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime. American oil companies will do an incredible job for the people of Venezuela and will represent the United States well.\"",
      "A Chevron spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News on whether it plans to boost production in Venezuela, saying it \"remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "American Petroleum Institute spokesperson Bethany Williams said the trade group is \"closely watching developments involving Venezuela.\"",
      "\"Globally, energy companies make investment decisions based on stability, the rule of law, market forces, and long-term operational considerations,\" Williams added.",

      "While prices are expected to average below $3 in 2026, GasBuddy says drivers should expect some volatility throughout the year due to seasonal demand, weather and geopolitical risks.",

    "story": [
      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving Venezuela's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon are planning to meet with Trump administration officials later this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "Shares of the three companies\u00a0rose on Wall Street Monday, a sign investors see upside for Big Oil following the developments in Venezuela.",
      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said. For example, U.S. refineries like Texas-based Valero could gain access to a huge, geographically proximate source of the heavy crude they require to produce different fuels.",

      "Shares in other U.S. energy sector players also rose, with oil services giants Halliburton and Schlumberger both adding more than 10%. The price of U.S. crude rose 1.4% to $58.13 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, climbed 1.2% to $61.50.",
      "Oil industry players drifted up amid a broader surge in stocks on Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 549 points, or 1.2%, to close at an all-time high of 48,977. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.",
      "After Maduro's capture, President Trump said U.S. oil companies would participate in rebuilding Venezuela's decaying energy infrastructure.",
      "Venezuela's oil sector produces 750 million to 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data. The U.S., the world's largest oil producer, produces 13.5 million barrels per day, while No. 2 Saudi Arabia pumps an estimated 10 million barrels.",
      "Yet while Venezuela's oil production has plunged in recent decades due to government mismanagement, underinvestment and the impact of U.S. sanctions, the country is sitting on proven reserves of more than 300 billion barrels \u2014 the world's largest oil patch.",
      "While experts think that significantly boosting oil production in Venezuela could cost upwards of $100 billion and take at least a decade, some Wall Street analysts foresee a potentially faster upgrade.",
      "\"Venezuela could realistically achieve production levels of 1.3\u20131.4 [million barrels per day] within two years of a political transition,\" analysts with J.P. Morgan Markets said in a report.",
      "\"U.S. companies that may become involved in Venezuela are primarily major oil firms like Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. Chevron already has a presence in the country, while others are exploring opportunities to recover previously expropriated assets and invest in Venezuela's massive heavy crude reserves,\" J.P. Morgan added. \"There may also be interest from U.S Gulf Coast refiners seeking less costly sources of heavy oil.\"",
      "Venezuela produces thick crude with high amounts of sulfur and metal that is widely used to produce diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, among other uses.",
      "Despite Venezuela's ample oil reserves, David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at investment adviser Capital Economics, said the business case for investing in the country's weakened energy sector is questionable, pointing to the high projected costs of extracting its \"heavy\" oil reserves.",
      "\"Crucially, we already expect lower oil prices to drive a modest decline in domestic U.S. oil production into 2027, and so the broader backdrop is hardly conducive to large-scale investments in new high-cost wells in Venezuela,\" he said in a client note.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk said that people who used the oral medication during phase 3 of clinical trials lost about 14% of their body weight, while those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17%.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/greg-abel-berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-successor/",
    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 22:55:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive served as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-ballroom-project-east-wing-demolition/",
    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:11:52 -0500",
    "summary": "The White House says structural issues and decay had made it unfeasible to save the East Wing.",
    "story": [
      "The White House said Thursday that it was not feasible to save the building's East Wing because of structural issues, past decay and other major concerns, as officials shared details of President Trump's planned ballroom at a public meeting of the planning commission charged with approving it.",
      "It was the most comprehensive explanation to date for the dramatic demolition of the East Wing in October to make way for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom. The demolition caused a public stir when it began in October with little advance notice, drawing criticism from Democrats and historic preservation groups.",
      "Josh Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, ticked off a list of problems in explaining why it was more economical to tear down the East Wing than to renovate it, saying that there were \"significant deficiencies and overall poor structural design and construction.\"",
      "\"The colonnade was structurally unstable. The roof systems had exceeded their service life, and the underpinnings were not sufficient to support the necessary upgrades,\" Fisher told members of the National Capital Planning Commission. \"In the East Wing, there was chronic water intrusion, accelerated deterioration and mold contamination. The electrical infrastructure was obsolete, deemed undersized and non-compliant with current code. Facilities were also non-compliant with both ADA and Secret Service requirements.\"",
      "\"Because of this and other factors, the cost analysis proved that demolition and reconstruction provided the lowest total cost ownership and most effective long-term strategy,\" Fisher continued.",
      "The project's architect, Shalom Baranes, joined other construction and White House officials in presenting a detailed plan to the commission Thursday about what the new ballroom would look like. They said its design is expected to include adding a second story to the colonnade outside the West Wing, which would help make the building more uniform with the new ballroom being built on the other side of the White House. It would also dramatically alter the iconic space outside the Oval Office.",
      "Baranes told the commission that the heights of the White House and ballroom \"will match exactly.\"",
      "The project also will include a new visitors' entry complex, which is meant to speed access to those coming to the White House to use the new ballroom and ensure that they won't have to mill around under the tents or other temporary structures that are currently sometimes erected for large gatherings.",
      "Some of the 12 commission members raised concerns, particularly Commissioner Phil Mendelson, who asked if the planned size and location of the ballroom might change going forward. He was told that \"anything's possible\" but that the existing plans had been studied very thoroughly.",
      "Mendelson, who also serves as chairman of the D.C. Council, then asked if the planned ceiling height of 38 to 40 feet (11.5 to 12 meters) could still be lowered before the final structure is finished and received assurances that the number wasn't fully set.",
      "\"It still seems to me it's overwhelming the existing building,\" Mendelson said.",
      "Upon its completion, the ballroom is expected to be larger than the rest of the existing White House. Will Scharf, a top White House aide who has been tapped by Mr. Trump to head the commission, seemed to listen to the questions and concerns Mendelson raised.",
      "Mendelson also asked why the project hadn't been presented in its entirety to the commission before demolition of the East Wing began. Fisher said some things about the ballroom's construction were of a \"top secret nature.\" Scharf repeated his past assertions that the planning commission doesn't usually have jurisdiction over site work and demolition on any project, including those at the White House.",
      "He pointed to recent work at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, which he said was an example of demolition beginning before the commission fully approved plans.",
      "Scharf acknowledged that the ballroom project had prompted \"agitation\" from some quarters, saying it had sparked \"passionate comments on both sides\" while also noting that public comment wouldn't be part of Thursday's session.",
      "But commissioners were allowed to ask questions and give feedback, with a more formal review expected in the spring that would include public testimony and votes. The commission's next meeting is Feb. 5.",
      "After commissioner questions, Scharf defended the project, arguing that the White House needed a larger and more elegant space to hold visitors. He recalled visiting Windsor Castle last year with Mr. Trump, and noted that the president would eventually be hosting King Charles III of Great Britain.",
      "\"More likely than not, he will be hosted in a tent on the south lawn with porta-potties,\" Scharf said.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Scharf said, \"Our concern is not so much about whether a ballroom is a good idea or not. I obviously believe that it is.\"",
      "\"Our concerns are how will that impact the public viewing experience, the visitor experience,\" he said. \"How will this new building interact with the other existing buildings in the area and more broadly in the city.\"",
      "The White House in December submitted its ballroom plans to the commission, which is one of two federal panels that review construction on federal land \u2014 usually before ground is broken.",
      "The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to halt construction of the $400 million ballroom, accusing the Trump administration of violating federal laws by proceeding before submitting the project for the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment.",
      "A summary on the commission's website said the purpose of the project is to \"establish a permanent, secure event space within the White House grounds\" that provides increased capacity for official state functions, eliminates reliance on temporary tents and support facilities, and \"protects the historic integrity and cultural landscape of the White House and its grounds.\"",
      "A comprehensive design plan for the White House prepared in 2000 identified the \"need for expanded event space to address growing visitor demand and provide a venue suitable for significant events,\" the summary said. And it said successive administrations had \"recognized this need as an ongoing priority.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has been talking about building a White House ballroom for years. Last July, the White House announced a 90,000-square-foot (8,400-square-meter) space would be built on the east side of the complex to accommodate 650 seated guests at a then-estimated cost of $200 million. Trump has said it will be paid for with private donations, including from him.",
      "But he later increased the ballroom's capacity to 999 people and by October, had demolished the two-story East Wing of the White House to build it there. In December, he raised the price tag for the project to $400 million \u2014 twice the original estimate.",
      "The White House has announced few other details about the project but has said it would be completed before Mr. Trump's term ends in January 2029. The president has said the ballroom will be big enough for future presidential inaugurations to be held there and has also said it will have security features, such as bulletproof glass.",
      "While he was in Florida last week, the president bought marble and onyx for the ballroom \"at his own expense,\" the White House said. The cost was not disclosed.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Thursday that he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he argued would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
      "Mr. Trump and the White House have been trying to show they are responding to voter concerns about affordability ahead of midterm elections in November. Home prices have generally risen faster than incomes because of a persistent construction shortfall, making it harder for renters to buy their first home and for existing owners to upgrade to a new property \u2014 a challenge that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and the recovery from the housing market collapse that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "Mr. Trump last month said he planned to unveil housing reforms \u2014 and on Wednesday, he announced that he\u00a0wants to block institutional investors from buying houses.",
      "The president said Thursday that the two mortgage giants under government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have $200 billion in cash that will be used to make the mortgage bond purchases.",
      "\"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "Federal Housing Finance Authority Director Bill Pulte, who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said on X the two government-run companies \"will be executing\" the president's request.",
      "The Federal Reserve has, in the past, bought mortgage bonds during times of economic turmoil in order to help reduce interest rates, leading many homeowners to refinance into rates of 3% or less. The low rates of the recent past make these homeowners reluctant to sell their properties, depriving the market of inventory.",
      "Additional mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie could temporarily help lower mortgage costs, but that approach also could have unintended consequences, according to TD Securities analysts.",
      "\"We see this succeeding in the short term, though we believe it will reignite home prices' inflation given supply constraints,\" they said in a research note, alluding to a severe shortage of affordable housing in the U.S.",
      "Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate brokerage Redfin, estimated to the Associated Press that the government purchases of mortgage debt could shave 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points off the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. But she also cautioned that the purchases wouldn't address other factors driving high housing costs, like limited supply.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the\u00a0U.S. are unaffordable\u00a0for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site. Property data firm ATTOM found Thursday that in the last three months of 2025, median-priced single-family homes were less affordable than historical averages in 99% of the nearly 600 U.S. counties the company analyzed.",
      "Mortgage rates have been averaging around 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, which went into federal conservatorship along with Fannie Mae in 2008 when the U.S. economy crashed during the Great Recession. Thirty-year mortgage rates haven't been below 6% since September 2022.",
      "Mortgage rates began to climb as inflation spiked coming out of the global pandemic, with the consumer price index hitting a four-decade high in 2022. The average mortgage rate is down from nearly 7% at the start of Mr. Trump's second term last year, yet the decrease has done little to reassure a public that feels pressure from the costs of housing, food and energy.",
      "When interest rates fall it can become cheaper to service housing debt on a monthly basis. The reduced monthly payments can improve affordability for a period until home prices adjust in response to changes in the rates. There was roughly $21.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt as of the middle of last year, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.",
      "Many homeowners took advantage of low interest rates during the pandemic to refinance their mortgages at rates of 3% or lower.",
      "The plan to buy up hundreds of billions in mortgage bonds could also carry some risk for Fannie and Freddie because Mr. Trump would be spending the cash reserves that are supposed to help be a buffer against an economic downturn akin to what happened during the Great Recession. In a sense, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could be more vulnerable if anything negative happens to the housing market, meaning Mr. Trump is betting that possibility is highly unlikely.",
      "Fannie and Freddie work by buying up scores of residential mortgages and repackaging them as mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors. Collectively, they guarantee trillions of dollars' worth of mortgages.",
      "In the past, the president has pushed to take Fannie and Freddie public. Supporters argue that move could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, but critics warn it may push up mortgage rates by raising uncertainty about the two megafirms.",
      "But on Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to rethink that plan, writing: \"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount \u2014 AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE \u2014 and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH.\"",

      "The deadly ICE shooting in Minneapolis ignited a heated exchange in Washington between two Minnesota lawmakers.",
      "Democratic Rep. Angie Craig and Republican Majority Whip Tom Emmer got into a testy back-and-forth, lasting about 40 seconds on Wednesday.",
      "A C-SPAN live stream captured the moment during a break on the House floor. It shows Craig getting face-to-face with Emmer, starting an animated argument.",
      "She told WCCO she wanted to address what she viewed as Emmer's lack of standing up for Minnesotans, after he made several posts\u00a0Wednesday on Facebook defending ICE's actions in the state, including the deadly shooting.",
      "\"I'm not going to let my Republican colleagues get away with just ignoring the fact that someone, Renee Good, a woman in Minnesota, was killed yesterday because of these political stunts,\" she said.",
      "Good was shot and killed amid a surge of federal agents in the Twin Cities area as part of the Trump administration's ongoing crackdown on immigration and a fraud scandal in Minnesota.",
      "Things got so heated between the two House members that someone eventually stepped between Craig and Emmer. Then, fellow Democratic Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum pulled Craig back to separate them.",
      "In an interview with WCCO, Craig said that her emotions during their exchange were fueled by what she saw in the videos of the ICE shooting.",
      "When asked how Emmer responded to her, Craig said, \"Well, Tom didn't let me get three words out before he went from zero to 60 mph. So, look, if you can't have a conversation with someone without it escalating in the first three words, then you're not really ready to have a conversation and you're not listening. And I think that's part of my frustration, is, I want my Republican colleagues to understand and hear me and hear us as Minnesotans that having ICE on the ground in Minnesota is simply not making Minnesota any safer. In fact, it's having the opposite effect.\"",
      "WCCO reached out to Emmer's team over the phone and through email, offering an interview to share his side of the story, but has not heard back.",
      "Craig and several other local Democrats, like Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, are demanding ICE leave Minnesota.",
      "When asked what power Congress has to get ICE to leave, Craig said, \"Everything is on the table at what Congress might be able to do, including and up to impeaching [Department of Homeland Security] Secretary [Kristi] Noem. This woman is out of control. She's not there to make our communities any safer.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:06:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The House approved a three-year extension of expired health care tax credits, with increased Republican support.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House approved on Thursday a three-year extension of health care tax credits that expired at the end of last year, with a group of Republicans joining Democrats to propel the measure to passage in the lower chamber.",
      "In a 230 to 196 vote, 17 Republicans joined all Democrats in favor of the measure. The legislation is unlikely to pass the Senate in its current form, but some lawmakers are hopeful it will serve as the starting point for a broader compromise.",
      "\"Today, let's celebrate a victory of getting something done,\" Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York told reporters Thursday. \"And then, we'll start working on the policy issue next week related to what's the common ground in the Senate that we can get to the next step.\"",
      "The outcome came after four Republicans crossed the aisle last month, revolting against their leadership to join Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. The Affordable Care Act tax credits subsidized premiums for millions of Americans who have coverage in state-run exchanges. One analysis found that premiums were set to double without the enhanced credits.",
      "The tax credits' extension was at the center of the government shutdown, which stretched through October and into November to become the longest in history. After a handful of Senate Democrats broke with their party to end the shutdown without securing an extension for the enhanced tax credits, House Democrats pushed ahead on an effort of their own \u2014 but needed GOP support to make it successful.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, led the effort to force the vote with a discharge petition in the final weeks of the year. Moderate Republicans have generally criticized a straight extension of the tax credits without reforms. But a handful of GOP members signed onto the petition, arguing that an extension of the tax credits without reforms was preferable to letting them expire.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler of New York was one of the four Republicans who signed onto the petition last month, along with Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Ryan Mackenzie and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania.",
      "\"We endeavored in a bipartisan negotiation after the shutdown to come up with a compromise bill that would extend the subsidies, but put in place necessary reforms,\" Lawler told reporters Tuesday. \"Unfortunately, we couldn't get a vote on that before Christmas, and so the only alternative was to sign the three-year discharge.\"",
      "The moderate Republicans are banking on the measure being a vehicle for a compromise bill in the Senate.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that when we pass the discharge through the House, the Senate will be able to use that vehicle and garner enough support to get a bipartisan compromise across the finish line,\" Lawler said.",
      "The search for a Senate compromise",
      "A number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have been seeking a solution on health care costs. And the discharge petition added momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise before lawmakers broke for recess in December. Now, lawmakers are looking to the Senate to move ahead with a long-sought agreement to extend the credits, with some reforms.",
      "The Senate rejected a Democrat-led effort to pass a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits last month. Republicans offered an alternative plan to send funds directly to consumers through health savings accounts that also fell short. But a number of Senate Republicans expressed willingness to reach a compromise.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who's been involved in the discussions, told reporters on Tuesday that \"we're continuing to work hard\" on a compromise measure. She said parts of the measure would be similar to what she and Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, originally proposed last month. That plan would extend the tax credits for two years, with some reforms in the first year and then \"more substantial reforms\" in the second.",
      "Moreno outlined the emerging deal Thursday, telling reporters that it would include a two-year extension of the enhanced tax credits and an extension of the open enrollment period until March 1. It would also impose a new income eligibility cap for the subsidies at 700% of the federal poverty level; a $5 per month or $60 per year minimum premium; and a $100,000 fine of insurance companies \"for deliberately causing fraud\" by signing someone up without their consent. In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account.",
      "Leaving a bicameral meeting of the so-called \"problem solvers\" on Thursday, multiple lawmakers said they expected language from the compromise bill to be released next week.",
      "Asked after Thursday's vote whether he would back such a deal, Jeffries told reporters that House Democrats are \"focused on a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits at the moment.\"",
      "\"But we've always said that we will consider in good faith anything that emerges from the Senate in a bipartisan way, if it decisively deals with the Republican health care crisis, including by providing a meaningful extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, asked about the timeline for addressing the tax credits in the upper chamber, told reporters Wednesday that the conversations among the bipartisan group of lawmakers have been productive and \"we'll see where the discussions are going.\"",
      "\"There's some thorny issues they have to resolve,\" the South Dakota Republican said. \"You got to deal with reforms, you got to deal with a bridge to an HSA, and then obviously, Hyde is a big, big challenge.\"",
      "President Trump encouraged Republicans in Congress to be \"flexible\" on the Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions, in order to find a solution on health care costs. But conservatives in Congress haven't expressed willingness to move on the issue, seeking additional Hyde amendment language within the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges.",
      "\"There's no flexibility. You're either using public funds to pay for abortion or you're not. We're not sure there's a compromise available on that,\" Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Thune said while Collins and Moreno are trying to address the challenging issues, there isn't \"a landing spot just yet.\"",
      "\"The conversations are constructive,\" he added. \"But at this point, there's nothing that I'm aware of that we'll be voting on soon.\"",

      "\"This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,\" she said.",

      "The same agent was involved in a separate incident in June where, according to a senior DHS official, he was dragged by a vehicle while trying to apprehend a fleeing suspect. According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025, incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",

      "\"They have not been cut out,\" she said. \"They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "The Trump administration has\u00a0deployed about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents\u00a0to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region to crack down amid the\u00a0state's fraud scandal.",
      "Trump administration officials have said the shooting was in self-defense, while Minneapolis' mayor and Minnesota's governor have indicated otherwise after footage of the incident was posted online. The city of Minneapolis said police responded to a call reporting a shooting around in a Minneapolis neighborhood, and upon arrival, found that a woman in a vehicle had been shot in the head. She was pronounced dead at a local hospital.",
      "On Wednesday, Noem said any loss of life is a \"tragedy\" but alleged that this incident was \"preventable.\"",
      "\"ICE officers and agents approached the vehicle of the individual in question, who was blocking the officers in with her vehicle,\" Noem said Wednesday night. \"And she had been stalking and impeding their work all throughout the day. ICE agents repeatedly ordered her to get out of the car and to stop obstructing law enforcement, but she refused to obey their commands. She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.\"",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey expressed outrage\u00a0over the shooting, directing a message to federal immigration officials \u2014 \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "Noem on Thursday said Frey \"chose to stand with illegals\" with his statements, and criticized Democratic officials in Minnesota for their responses to the incident.",
      "Regarding the arrests and deportations of people suspected to be connected to Trinitarios, Noem said the group is behind the July 2025 shooting of an off-duty Customs and Border Protection officer in Manhattan. Federal authorities said the vast majority of those people had either charges or convictions, and all were in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"We've arrested 54 individuals as a part of Operation Salvo since its inception just a few months ago,\" Noem said. \"Those arrested are violent transnational gang members and affiliates associated with Trinitarios who are responsible for weapons trafficking, for human smuggling, for narcotics distribution and for armed robberies.

      "She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, her father, Timothy Granger, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. He said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her second husband.",

      "\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bulls***,\" Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"",

The Honda then starts to move forward, and the agent in front of the vehicle draws his weapon and fires into the Honda.",

      "\"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and drug him with a car back in June,\" Noem said. \"He sustained injuries at that time as well.\"",
      "According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025 incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.",
      "During that June incident, immigration officers in St. Paul were attempting to arrest a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, according to a senior DHS official.",
      "According to the official, the suspect refused to roll his window down or get out of his car, so the officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, the suspect drove off, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car. The suspect was accelerating and weaving to try to shake the officer off. The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. He was eventually knocked free of the vehicle, and suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, the official said. The suspect was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "Will the officer face charges or discipline?",
      "It was unclear if the officer would face any charges or discipline at the early stages of the investigation. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, however, criticized the Trump administration for allegedly\u00a0cutting state investigators out of the process.",
      "\"The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the BCA, spent the day yesterday trying to get that accountability. We have learned that the Trump administration has now denied the state that ability to participate in the investigation,\" Walz said at a Thursday news conference.",
      "\"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,\" he said of that decision, accusing Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Noem of making statements about the incident that are \"verifiably false.\"",
      "The BCA said in a statement it was initially invited to participate in the investigation but that the FBI later said it would be the sole lead and \"the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\"",
      "\"Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,\" the agency said.",
      "Noem, however, said Thursday, \"They have not been cut out. They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "\"This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,\" she added.",
      "Shooting prompts local outrage",
      "Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence. Many attended a vigil for Good, creating an impromptu memorial where the shooting occurred. Local officials implored those demonstrating to remain peaceful.",
      "In his news conference Wednesday, Frey had a blunt message to federal immigration officers, \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "\"They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,\" the mayor said.",
      "About 1,500 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents and 650 Homeland Security Investigations agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities in recent weeks, CBS News has learned, an increase 15 times the normal ICE presence in the region.",
      "Walz in his Wednesday news conference said the state \"doesn't need any further help from the federal government.\"",
      "\"To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough,\" Walz said.",
      "The governor also directed the Minnesota National Guard to prepare in the event that it was need to assist state and local authorities amid the fallout from the shooting.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a statement that \"ICE must stop terrorizing our communities.\"",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Mr. Trump's decision to send thousands of federal agents to Minnesota is \"causing serious harm and spreading terror\" through the community.",
      "Minneapolis Public Schools announced late Wednesday that, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" classes would be canceled districtwide for all schools both Thursday and Friday \"due to safety concerns related to today's incidents around the city.\" All after-school activities and athletics would be canceled as well.",

    "summary": "ICE head Tom Homan told \"CBS Evening News\" Wednesday it would be \"unprofessional to pass judgment\" before a full review.",
    "story": [
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday took aim at what he called a \"disconnect\" between Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's swift assessment of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer's shooting of a Minnesota woman, and ICE director Tom Homan's comment on \"CBS Evening News\" Wednesday that it would be \"unprofessional to pass judgment\" on the incident before a full review.",
      "Walz held a press conference Thursday as Minnesota officials and federal officials disagree over what happened during the incident as well as the handling of the investigation into the incident, with the FBI taking charge of the investigation. Noem on Wednesday characterized the woman's actions leading up to the shooting as constituting an \"act of domestic terrorism.\" Homan was initially more cautious in casting judgment, saying they should \"let the investigation play out,\" although he has since amended his assessment so that it matches up more closely with Noem's.",
      "\"No one less than Tom Homan said yesterday that It would be unprofessional to pass judgment ahead of time,\" Walz said Thursday. \"Now, the disconnect between what Tom Homan said and what Kristi Noem said needs to be rectified by the federal government.\"",
      "In his interview with CBS News on Wednesday, Homan said the investigation had \"just started\" and he was \"not going to make a judgment call on one video when there's a hundred videos out there.\"",
      "\"I wasn't on the scene,\" Homan continued. \"I'm not an officer that may have body cam video. It would be unprofessional to comment on what I think happened in that situation. Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation.\"",
      "Noem judged the situation far more quickly Wednesday, saying the woman was \"using a vehicle to try to kill an officer and his colleagues\" and, \"It was an act of domestic terrorism.",
      "On Thursday morning, Noem said she \"didn't see those comments\" by Homan but also said she understood that Homan \"put out a statement later as well.\"",
      "\"I'll let Tom speak to that, but all of us are on the same page in the fact that this law enforcement officer followed his training and that he defended and acted in defense of his life and those around him,\" Noem told reporters Thursday.",
      "In a statement released Wednesday night, Homan said, \"The incident in Minneapolis today is yet another tragic example of the results of the hateful rhetoric and violent attacks against the men and women of ICE and BP. These brave men and women are forced to conduct law enforcement operations in heightened threat environments every day. Like all Americans, our officers have a right to self defense.\"",
      "On Thursday, Walz had additional criticisms for Noem, President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, slamming their characterizations of the incident as \"verifiably false.\"",
      "Walz said the \"only way we find the answers is a thorough investigation.\" Walz said he's seen the video, but a thorough investigation will determine what happened before that.",
      "\"Very, very difficult for Minnesotans to think in any way this is going to be fair when Kristi Noem was judge, jury and basically executioner yesterday,\" Walz said Thursday. \"That's very, very difficult to think that they are going to be fair.\"",

    "summary": "The Minneapolis-based officer was part of an enforcement and removal operations special response team and had a decade of experience.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good during an immigration operation in Minneapolis Wednesday was assigned to an enforcement and removal operations special response team, known as ERO SRT, and he was previously dragged by a car when trying to arrest a man in Bloomington, Minnesota, six months ago.",
      "In the court records from that incident, the officer is identified as Jonathan Ross.",
      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters Wednesday the officer had been dragged by a car in an incident in June. In that incident, which took place on June 17, 2025, federal immigration officers attempted to arrest Roberto Carlos Munoz, a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, on an immigration warrant in St. Paul. As agents tried to conduct a traffic stop and take him into custody, Munoz refused orders to roll down his windows or exit the vehicle.",
      "An ICE ERO officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, Munoz put the vehicle in drive, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car as he accelerated and weaved to try to shake him off.",
      "The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. Eventually, the officer was freed when the vehicle knocked him out of the window and Munoz continued fleeing. The officer suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, and Munoz was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon. The ERO agent involved in this incident was the same agent that opened fire Thursday. He is based in Minneapolis and has over 10 years of experience.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "ICE Special Response Teams provide high-risk operational support for immigration enforcement actions, including executing arrest and search warrants, responding to barricaded subjects, transporting dangerous detainees, and assisting with riot control or disturbances at detention facilities. SRT members receive advanced training in tactical operations, firearms, defensive tactics and crowd control, and they are deployed when situations exceed the capabilities of standard ERO officers.",
      "CBS News has also asked DHS about the officer's disciplinary history.",
      "The shooting occurred at a time when agents have been accused of operating with impunity. When CBS News asked Customs and Border Protection Commander Chief Bovino late last year if any CBP or ICE agents had been disciplined as a result of recent immigration raids, he said that none had been. ICE's head of training, Caleb Vitello, also told us last month in an interview he has not seen any uptick in discipline or investigations.",
      "Under DHS policy, which was last updated in 2023, firearms may not be discharged solely to disable a moving vehicle, and shooting at a moving vehicle is tightly restricted to two narrow circumstances: When a person in the vehicle is using or imminently threatening deadly force by means other than the vehicle, or when the vehicle itself is being operated in a manner that poses an imminent threat, and no other objectively reasonable defensive option exists. This explicitly includes \"moving out of the path of the vehicle,\" the policy says.",
      "As one former senior Homeland Security Investigations agent put it: \"I've been conducting stops and approaches for 25 years \u2026 I never ever wanted to be intentionally in front of the vehicle.\"",
      "There's a tactical expectation that officers avoid self-created jeopardy and, when feasible, they're supposed to try to distance and make angles between themselves and a threat.",
      "Meanwhile, the plaintiffs behind a landmark injunction in Chicago limiting immigration agents' use of force are set to dismiss their lawsuit, even as federal officials signal renewed enforcement surges in major cities.",
      "The case curbed chemical weapons, required body cameras and clear IDs, but now ends without a final ruling. The plaintiffs are dropping their suit not because their concerns have been addressed, but because the 7th Circuit signaled it was likely to overturn it, risking a bad precedent.",
      "In practical terms, this means ICE and Border Patrol are no longer legally bound by the injunction's requirements to limit chemical agents, wear body cameras, or clearly identify themselves. The government does not admit wrongdoing and federal agents can resume the same tactics that were challenged.",
      "The Trump administration's deployment of about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area is part of a crackdown on Minnesota's fraud scandal and immigration.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate agreed Thursday to display a plaque recognizing the police officers who defended the Capitol during the riots on Jan. 6, 2021, a step forward in a yearslong stalemate over a law that required Congress to hang up the plaque by March 2023.",
      "Senators passed by unanimous consent a resolution that orders the Architect of the Capitol to \"prominently display\" the plaque in a public area on the Senate side of the Capitol building until it can be placed in a more prominent location. The measure was supported by Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon.",
      "Tillis said the plaque may be displayed in the Senate's third-floor public gallery, one area that was ransacked by rioters.",
      "The timeline for when the plaque will be hung is unclear.",
      "Both houses of Congress voted in 2022 to require the honorary plaque to be hung, aiming to honor members of the U.S. Capitol Police and other agencies who faced off against a mob of rioters just over five years ago. Some 140 police officers were injured during the riot, and several died by suicide in the weeks after the attack. The plaque was set to be hung on the western front of the Capitol, the site of some of the most violent attacks on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "A plaque was ordered, but it was never publicly mounted, drawing years of scrutiny from congressional Democrats and Jan. 6 first responders.",
      "Two police officers who responded to the riots sued over the issue last year, asking a judge to compel the Architect of the Capitol \u2014 who oversees the complex \u2014 to display the plaque.",
      "Last month, attorneys for the Justice Department who were representing the Architect of the Capitol asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed. In part, they argued the plaque that had been created was not in compliance with the 2022 law because it listed the police agencies that responded to the Jan. 6 riot rather than every individual police officer who responded.",
      "Thursday's vote marks a symbolic break by Senate Republicans from President Trump. Tillis has repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump for pardoning virtually all Capitol riot defendants, whom the North Carolina Republican has called \"thugs.\"",
      "It also follows opposition by House Speaker Mike Johnson. A spokesperson for the Louisiana Republican said earlier this week, \"The statute authorizing this plaque is not implementable.\"",
      "In remarks Thursday, Tillis called the dispute a \"technical implementation problem\" raised by House leadership, one that he said lawmakers \"can cure pretty quickly if they think it's a concern.\"",
      "Tillis said on the Senate floor the plaque was intended to recognize \"one of the most significant stress tests for this institution since it was founded.\"",
      "Merkley said in a statement the delay in hanging the plaque was an \"egregious insult to all those who were injured defending the Capitol.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday failed to override two of President Trump's vetoes of bipartisan bills, with Republicans largely sticking by the president to uphold his decision to block the legislation.",
      "Both bills initially passed the House and Senate unanimously. Thursday's votes required a two-thirds majority to override the vetoes, but both fell significantly short.",
      "One of the pieces of legislation would have given the Miccosukee Tribe more control over a portion of the Florida Everglades, and the second would have funded a water pipeline in southeast Colorado. The president vetoed both in December.",
      "The vote to override Mr. Trump's veto of the Florida bill was 236 in favor to 188 opposed. The vote on the veto of the Colorado bill was 248 to 177.",
      "In a message to Congress, Mr. Trump explained the vetoes were aimed at \"ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts.\" But some lawmakers viewed the blocking of the bills as retaliation over political disagreements.",
      "The president tied his decision on the Florida bill in part to the tribe's opposition to his immigration policies. Last year, the Miccosukee Tribe joined a lawsuit challenging an immigration detention center, known as \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" in the Everglades. The tribe argued the detention center could have adverse effects on the environment.",
      "\"Despite seeking funding and special treatment from the federal government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected,\" Mr. Trump said in his notification to Congress. \"My administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"",
      "In Colorado, Mr. Trump has lashed out at officials over the case of Tina Peters, a former state election official who is imprisoned on state charges for tampering with voting machines during the 2020 election.",
      "Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado sponsored the legislation to help local governments pay for the Arkansas Valley Conduit water pipeline. She was also one of the GOP lawmakers who helped force the release of the Epstein files, resisting pressure from the White House to back down.",
      "Boebert criticized Mr. Trump's veto, saying he was \"denying clean drinking water to 50,000 people in southeast Colorado, many of whom enthusiastically voted for him in all three elections.\"",
      "\"I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability,\" she said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House easily approved bipartisan legislation Thursday to fund several federal agencies and programs through September as lawmakers work to avert the threat of another government shutdown later this month.",
      "In a 397 to 28 vote, lawmakers approved the three-bill package, known as a \"minibus,\" which House and Senate negotiators released earlier this week. The package includes funding for science initiatives and the Departments of Commerce and Justice; energy and water development; and the Department of Interior and the EPA.",
      "Congress has until Jan. 30 to fund major parts of the government, after lawmakers approved a short-term funding measure to end the longest government shutdown in history in November. That three-bill package funded parts of the government through September and extended funding for the remaining nine appropriations bills on a temporary basis.",
      "Negotiations have hit snags at several points in the weeks since. The latest funding package was split in two after a conservative rebellion threatened to stall the legislation.",
      "House conservatives had expressed opposition to earmarks within the package. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, blasted funding for specific projects in Democrats' districts, while lauding his work to prevent an \"outrageous\" earmark for an organization in Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar's district.",
      "To appease conservatives, GOP leaders agreed to separate the Commerce, Justice and science portion from the other two bills. The maneuver gave conservatives an opportunity to vote against the Commerce, Justice and science portion \u2014 which includes provisions they disapprove of \u2014 while voting in favor of the other measures.",
      "In a 375 to 47 vote, the House approved the Commerce, Justice and science piece of the legislation. The portion dealing with energy and water development, the Department of Interior and the EPA passed 419 to 6. The House then voted to recombine the bills and send the final version to the Senate.",
      "The path to averting a partial government shutdown",
      "The Senate is expected to take up the package as soon as next week, with dwindling time to address the remaining funding bills.",
      "Besides the three bills and the package passed in November, Congress has six other funding measures to assemble and approve before the end of the month. And if all funding isn't approved before the deadline, lawmakers may be forced to again extend funding on a temporary basis to avoid a partial shutdown of the unfunded agencies.",
      "Both chambers are expected to forge ahead quickly in the coming weeks. House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference Wednesday that the lower chamber plans to take up three more funding bills next week and go from there.",
      "\"With just three weeks to go until the funding deadline, we are very hopeful, very bullish, that this package of bills is going to continue our good momentum toward completing annual apportions with regular order without a bloated, wasteful omnibus spending bill,\" Johnson said.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the Senate, said that the next package is expected to include funding for the Department of Homeland Security; the State Department and foreign operations; and financial services and general government. The final package, Collins said, would then include funding for the Departments of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; and Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.",

    "summary": "John Sarcone is the fifth of the administration's picks for U.S. attorney who were serving in a temporary capacity and have been disqualified by a federal judge.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in New York disqualified acting U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of New York John Sarcone from handling two investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James\u00a0on Thursday, ruling that he was not lawfully serving in his position when subpoenas to James' office were issued.",
      "Sarcone, a former campaign attorney for President Trump, was appointed to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in the Northern District of New York, which includes Albany, last year, after President Trump declined to nominate anyone for the post when he took office. When his 120-day term in that role ran out, judges in the district declined to keep him in his role.",
      "But shortly afterwards, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Sarcone as a special attorney and named him the first assistant U.S. attorney in the northern district to attempt to keep him in as acting U.S. attorney.",
      "Sarcone is the fifth of the administration's picks for U.S. attorney who were serving in a temporary capacity and have been disqualified by a federal judge.",
      "Sarcone's office had been investigating James for her office's handling of the civil fraud investigation into President Trump and a lawsuit filed by her office against the National Rifle Association and executives there. As part of that investigation, James was subpoenaed in August.",
      "After the subpoenas were issued, James sued to quash them, arguing in court documents that Sarcone was unlawfully appointed. The Justice Department argued that the \"special attorney\" title given to Sarcone gave him subpoena power.",
      "In a 24-page opinion issued Thursday, U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield ruled that Sarcone \"is not lawfully serving as Acting U.S. Attorney\" and found that \"any of his past or future acts taken in that capacity are void or voidable as they would rest on authority Mr. Sarcone does not lawfully have.\"",
      "The steps Bondi took to keep Sarcone in his job, Schofield wrote, were not legal.",
      "\"Instead, on the same day that the judges declined to extend Mr. Sarcone's appointment, the Department took coordinated steps \u2014 through personnel moves and shifting titles \u2014 to install Mr. Sarcone as Acting U.S. Attorney. Federal law does not permit such a workaround,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Schofield also quashed two subpoenas issued to James' office, finding that they \"were issued through an official acting without lawful authority,\" because he remained in his job after the 120-day limit expired, and was never nominated or confirmed by the Senate for the post.",
      "Sarcone, Schofield ruled, \"is also disqualified from any further involvement in prosecuting or supervising the criminal investigations that prompted the subpoenas.\"",
      "The ruling is another win for James, who successfully argued for the criminal case against her in Virginia to be thrown out at least temporarily, because the federal prosecutor there, Lindsey Halligan, was also unlawfully appointed to her position. The Justice Department is appealing that decision.",
      "In September, a federal judge ruled that a top federal prosecutor in Nevada was serving unlawfully, and in August, another judge ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal attorney for Mr. Trump, was serving illegally as U.S. attorney for New Jersey.",

      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz implored the federal authorities to allow state investigators to work alongside them as they launch a probe\u00a0into the shooting death of a 37-year-old woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer\u00a0on Wednesday, after the\u00a0Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the FBI blocked them from accessing evidence.",
      "Walz, a Democrat, during a Thursday news conference, reiterated that the Trump administration denied the state the ability to participate in the investigation and urged them to reconsider.",
      "He questioned if Minnesotans would trust the outcome without state investigators' input.",
      "The FBI declined to comment on the\u00a0BCA statement.",
      "\"It feels now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,\" Walz said. \"I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment\u2014from the president, to the vice president to [Department of Homeland Security Secretary] Kristi Noem, who has stood and told you things that are verifiably false.\"",
      "Noem said the victim, Renee Good, attempted to run over an ICE officer with her car in what she claimed was an \"act of domestic terrorism.\" President Donald Trump\u00a0on his social media also claimed\u00a0she was a \"professional agitator\" who \"ran over\" an ICE officer who responded by shooting her in self-defense.",
      "Eyewitness video evidence from the scene at times contradicts those definitive statements and what occurred is in dispute. A retired ICE agent\u00a0who spent a quarter-century with federal law enforcement\u00a0told CBS News that the video he's seen of the incident leaves him with a number of concerns.",
      "The current\u00a0policy for ICE and DHS agents\u00a0outlines very narrow acceptable reasons for an officer to fire a weapon into a moving vehicle. Border czar Tom Homan said\u00a0he would not comment on what happened\u00a0before an investigation is complete.",
      "\"I don't have a predetermined notion. Yes, I saw the video. Yes, I saw that. But a thorough investigation will see what happened before that. It will take all factors in and come up with a fair and just conclusion. And we will accept that,\" Walz said. \"Very, very difficult for Minnesotans to think in any way this is going to be fair when Kristi Noem was judge, jury and basically executioner yesterday.\"",
      "Bob Jacobsen, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said the state BCA was initially invited to do a joint investigation, which is not uncommon and has been done before. He said the FBI has shared none of the investigative reports or evidence with state authorities.",
      "\"Wiithout any of that information or without any of that assistance from the FBI and the federal government, we would be at a loss to initiate and conduct a thorough investigation,\" Jacobsen explained. \"For us to be able to do that, it would be extremely difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014without cooperation from the federal government.\"",
      "That could impede the state from making the decision to file any criminal charges against the officer, Jacobsen said, citing the need for a full investigation.",
      "\"I will not as a public safety professional jump to any conclusions as to who is at fault in this,\" he told reporters. \"What I will say, though, is that unless we do that thorough investigation, unless we have access to all of that evidence, unless we have access to agents that were involved in that and to any witnesses\u2014without any of that, we would not be able to put together a quality investigation for any prosecutor to be able to make a determination as to whether or not someone should be charged with a crime.\"",
      "A source briefed on the matter told CBS News that the FBI is conducting interviews with eyewitnesses and federal officers at the scene, analyzing videos of what occurred from all angles, and are putting together a timeline of what happened.",
      "That person said the agency will turn over the evidence to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota and the Department of Homeland Security, where the officer is employed.",

      "At the outset of the daring operation, a formation of U.S. Army helicopters carrying a squad of Delta Force commandos slipped toward Caracas largely unnoticed.",
      "But as the aircraft drew closer to the heavily fortified compound where Maduro was believed to be holed up, the calm broke. Venezuelan defensive positions opened fire, and U.S. helicopters responded with their own suppressive fire, according to the U.S. officials.",
      "A heavy, twin-rotor MH-47 Chinook, the lead aircraft in the formation tasked with inserting the assault team, was struck by hostile fire.",
      "Though damaged, it remained airborne and completed its run. The U.S. officials who spoke to CBS News said the Chinook pilot who also helped plan the mission was wounded multiple times in the leg during the engagement.",

      "\"They are receiving excellent medical care and are well on their way to recovery. Five additional service members suffered injuries but have already returned to duty.\u00a0 The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" said the Pentagon official.",

      "Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken to a federal detention center in New York City after the raid.",

      "The Senate voted 52 to 47 to advance Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia's\u00a0 resolution under the War Powers Act earlier Thursday, less than a week after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "The GOP senators who voted with Democrats to advance the measure were Todd Young of Indiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri.",
      "Mr. Trump's rebuke of Hawley is particularly striking, given the Missouri senator's history of staunch support for the administration's agenda in most other areas. Hawley was reelected to a second term in the Senate in 2024.",
      "At the Capitol, Hawley said he didn't take any offense to Mr. Trump's comments, adding \"I support the president.\"",
      "\"I understand he's ticked,\" Hawley told reporters. \"No president likes the War Powers Act.\"",
      "Paul also brushed off Mr. Trump's post, saying he's spoken with the president several times this week and his support of the war powers push isn't personal.",
      "\"On this issue, it's a constitutional debate,\" Paul told reporters. \"What I said to him is it's more of an academic debate than it is an anti-Donald Trump [debate]. I think it's easy for presidents to take things personally.\"",
      "There are still several steps before a vote on final passage of the Senate measure. Even if it makes it through the chamber, it would still have to clear the House, where few Republicans have shown a willingness so far to buck Mr. Trump on the issue.",
      "Two previous attempts to limit the president's authority last year amid strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats failed to earn enough GOP support to advance. But Mr. Trump's comments about having the U.S. \"run\" Venezuela and the concern that U.S. forces could be deployed there tipped the scales against him in the latest vote.",
      "\"I believe invoking the War Powers Act at this moment is necessary, given the president's comments about the possibility of 'boots on the ground' and a sustained engagement 'running' Venezuela, with which I do not agree,\" Collins said in a statement.

      "Vance said the new assistant attorney general will help coordinate an administration-wide effort to investigate potential fraudulent activity in federally-backed programs and bring charges. The assistant attorney general will not work out of the Justice Department, the vice president said. Instead, the position will be run out of the White House and overseen by President Trump and Vance, he said.",
      "\"This is the person who is going to make sure we stop defrauding the American people,\" Vance told reporters at the White House press briefing.",
      "The assistant attorney general will be Senate-confirmed, and Vance said a nominee will likely be announced in the coming days. He said Senate Majority Leader John Thune pledged \"swift confirmation.\"",
      "The assistant attorney general leading the investigations will likely remain in place until the end of the Trump administration, according to Vance. He said the official will have \"nationwide jurisdiction over the issue of fraud,\" but efforts will begin and be focused primarily on Minnesota.",

      "More than 90 people have faced federal charges as a result of fraud schemes in the state that have been uncovered since 2021. Prosecutors have uncovered widespread fraud in various social-services programs, including a housing program for seniors, one that provides services to children with autism and the Federal Child Nutrition Program.",
      "Mr. Trump has attacked Minnesota leaders for their handling of the scandal and accused other states led by Democrats of allowing fraud in their own state-run initiatives. The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it planned to halt more than $10 billion in federal funding for social services programs in Minnesota, New York, California, Illinois and Colorado.

Mr. Trump has not ruled out additional military action. He has said that the U.S. will \"run\" the country for the time being and control its oil sales after Saturday's strikes, which were carried out as part of a daring operation to capture Maduro and bring him to the U.S. to face charges.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, introduced his latest resolution in early December, after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "\"The indication from the administration [is] that this is not a few days or a few weeks, it's likely a few years of U.S. occupation and involvement in this country,\" Kaine said Wednesday on the Senate floor. \"This is not an arrest warrant. This is far bigger than that.\"",
      "Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, held briefings for top lawmakers on Tuesday on last weekend's actions in the region. They held similar briefings for all members of Congress on Wednesday.",
      "Democrats left those briefings dissatisfied with the answers they received about what comes next.",
      "The boat strikes and Maduro's seizure and removal to the U.S. have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers, with some accusing the Trump administration of committing war crimes, lying about its intentions for regime change and leading the U.S. into a war without congressional authorization.",
      "\"I think bombing a capital and removing the head of state is by all definitions, war,\" Paul, the lone Republican cosponsor of the resolution, said Tuesday.",

      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho called the resolution \"nonsense,\" and said \"the effect of this is to slap the president of the United States in the face.\"",
      "\"That is the only effect that this vote can have. It can have no practical effect, because it's trying to stop something that isn't going on,\" Risch added.",
      "Boat strikes scrutinized",
      "In the weeks before Maduro's capture, Mr. Trump dialed up his pressure campaign, seizing two sanctioned tankers that were carrying oil from Venezuela. On Wednesday, the U.S. carried out operations to seize two more vessels linked to Venezuela.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has voted against the war powers resolutions, suggested that if the U.S. can seize a giant oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, it could also seize smaller boats allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "\"I would take note, if we can take a big ship like this, we may be able to take a few boats, too, without blowing them out of the water,\" he told reporters last month. \"But that's a decision they have to make on the ground, I guess, based on the threat level.\"",
      "Paul, who has been a fierce critic of the strikes and has decried the lack of due process, shared a letter he received from the U.S. Coast Guard that said dozens of suspected drug smuggling vessels interdicted by the military branch possessed no illegal drugs. In total, 212 interdictions occurred between Sept. 1, 2024, and Oct. 7, 2025, according to the letter. Of those, 41 boats had \"no illicit contraband on board when interdicted,\" according to the Coast Guard.",
      "The letter also provided details on interceptions in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"Of the 212 total vessels interdicted during this period, 69 vessels were interdicted in the Caribbean Sea by Coast Guard surface assets, operating under Coast Guard law enforcement authority,\" the letter continued. \"Of these 69 interdictions, 14 had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted; 11 of those 14 vessels without contraband did not appear to commit any federal criminal offense. Of the 69 Caribbean interdictions, 14 vessels were indicted off the coast of Venezuela. Three of the 14 vessels interdicted near Venezuela had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted, but one of the three violated other U.S. federal criminal statutes.\"",
      "To justify the strikes, the Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. Lawmakers critical of the military action argue the rationale in the opinion is inadequate for the situation and have demanded that it be made public.",
      "In December, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order designating fentanyl as a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" perhaps seeking to bolster the justification for military action around Venezuela.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:53:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

    "summary": "A planned spacewalk outside the International Space Station was scrapped because of what NASA called a \"medical concern\" with an unidentified crew member.",
    "story": [
      "Four space station fliers have been told to cut their mission short and return to Earth ahead of schedule because of an apparently serious medical issue affecting an unidentified crew member, NASA announced Thursday.",
      "\"Yesterday, January 7, a single crew member on board the station experienced a medical situation and is now stable,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a news conference.",
      "\"After discussions with Chief Health and Medical Officer Dr. J.D. Polk and leadership across the agency, I've come to the decision that it's in the best interest of our astronauts to return Crew 11 ahead of their planned departure (in mid February). ... We expect to provide a further update within the next 48 hours as to the expected, anticipated undock and re-entry timeline.\"",
      "In keeping with the agency's strict medical privacy policy, NASA officials have not identified the astronaut in question or provided any details about the nature of the medical issue.",
      "But the ailing astronaut is a member of NASA's Crew 11, made up of commander Zena Cardman, veteran astronaut Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "They were launched to the International Space Station on Aug. 1 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship. They were planning to return to Earth around Feb. 20, after their Crew 12 replacements arrive.",
      "Fincke and Cardman were planning to venture outside the space station on Thursday to complete a support truss for an add-on solar array and to carry out a variety of other tasks.",
      "But on Wednesday, NASA announced the spacewalk had been called off due to a \"medical concern\" with one of the Crew 11 astronauts. The agency said the crew member was \"stable,\" but no other details were provided.",
      "Polk said Thursday that the astronaut in question was not injured or made ill by any operational aspect of living aboard the space station, adding that spacewalk preparations played no role in the incident.",
      "Isaacman said the planned early return of Crew 11 did not represent an \"emergency,\" adding the agency was simply erring on the side of caution to ensure the health and well-being of the astronaut. Even so, Crew 11's early return will mark the first time in U.S. space history that a mission has been cut short due to a medical issue.",
      "Polk agreed it was not an emergency, adding \"This is not an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations, but unrelated to the operational environment that we have right now. It's mostly having a medical issue in the difficult areas of microgravity and with the suite of hardware that we have at our disposal available to complete a diagnosis.\"",
      "Space station crews have extensive medical equipment on board and crew members are trained to serve as medical officers.",
      "Physician and former astronaut Tom Marshburn told CBS News that space station crews are \"equipped to deal with all the things that have happened in space over the 65 years of human spaceflight, any of those things that come up. Even to the some extreme examples, like a heart attack, something like that. We have the tools to do it.",
      "\"We just can't sustain somebody sick for a really long period of time, just for a few days, perhaps. But pretty much any medical event that you can imagine ... could happen up there, yeah.\"",
      "Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, said Crew 11 will follow normal procedures when returning to Earth where they will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast. SpaceX support crews and NASA flight surgeons will be standing by aboard the company's Crew Dragon recovery ship. The crew will be flown to shore by helicopter and then fly by jet back to the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"As Dr. Polk mentioned, it's the first time we've done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle, so that is unusual,\" Kshatriya said. \"What's important to us is the whole crew, and we don't want to do anything, given the nature of the condition, that we put any other additional risk on the crew by diverging from our normal processes. So that's why we're doing essentially a controlled expedited return.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven. Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flier gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "Because of the ever-present chance that a Soyuz or Crew Dragon might have to depart early, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon.",
      "The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one spacecraft depart early and take all its crew members with it.",
      "For that reason, after Crew 11 undocks from the station, NASA will still have one astronaut \u2014 Chris Williams \u2014   aboard to operate systems in the lab's U.S. modules. He was launched to the outpost in November aboard a Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "A one-time volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician with a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, Williams was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams would be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are scheduled for launch Feb. 15.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for takeoff as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",
      "The high-profile Artemis 2 mission will be the first to send astronauts to the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years. Isaacman said he did not think the early return of Crew 11 and the possibly early launch of Crew 12 would have any impact on the moon mission.",

    "summary": "The hydrogen cloud is a remnant of the universe's early formation, NASA said in a news release.",
    "story": [
      "A team of researchers discovered a new type of astronomical object that may help experts learn more about the formation of galaxies and the development of the early universe.",
      "NASA dubbed the object \"Cloud-9\" and described it as a \"starless, gas-rich dark-matter\" hydrogen cloud and remnant of the universe's early formation about 14 million light-years from Earth. Scientists have theorized about such an object, but this is the first time one has been confirmed to exist, NASA said. These types of clouds are believed to be dark matter clouds that couldn't accumulate enough gas to form stars, NASA said.",
      "Cloud 9 was identified three years ago, but it wasn't until recently that the Hubble Space Telescope could be used to confirm there were no stars inside. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an assistant professor at Italy's Milano-Bicocca University and the principal investigator on the Hubble team, said that Cloud-9 tells the \"tale of a failed galaxy.\"",
      "\"In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes,\" Benitez-Llambay said. \"In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.\"",
      "The core of Cloud-9 is made up of neutral hydrogen. It is about 4,900 light-years in diameter, NASA said. The hydrogen is estimated to measure one million times the mass of the sun.",
      "Cloud-9 also includes a huge amount of dark matter -- about five billion solar masses worth, NASA said. Andrew Fox, a member of the team who studied the object, called it a \"window into the dark universe.\"",
      "\"We know from theory that most of the mass in the universe is expected to be dark matter, but it's difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn't emit light,\" said Fox. \"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.\"",
      "NASA said the cloud also \"suggests the existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated structures in the universe.\" Those kind of objects can be hard to study, because nearby bright features like stars and galaxies outshine them. Researchers also typically focus their attention on those brighter structures, NASA said. Because those items are hard to study, the findings from Cloud-9 help provide new insights, NASA said.",
      "Cloud-9 is the ninth gas cloud identified on the outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 94, NASA said. Cloud-9 is smaller, more compact and highly spherical compared to those other clouds. It also appears to have a \"physical association\" with Messier 94, NASA said.",
      "Astronomers will conduct further surveys into Cloud-9 to learn more about dark matter, failed galaxies and the early universe itself, NASA said. They will also search for other similar objects.",
      "\"Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,\" said researcher Rachael Beaton, of the Space Telescope Science Institute.",
      "Cloud-9 may continue to change and could even grow into a galaxy if it continues to expand, NASA said.",

    "story": [
      "Google on Thursday unveiled new artificial intelligence features in Gmail, an effort by the technology giant to refresh its 22-year-old messaging app amid growing use of AI.",
      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",
      "Google is offering paid Pro and Ultra subscribers access to technology that lets users ask natural-language questions directly in the Gmail search bar. Subscribers will also have access to a dedicated chatbot for follow-up questions.",
      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",
      "Meanwhile, the so-called\u00a0 \"Catch me up\" tool will provide users with reminders of their upcoming events and appointments. This includes but is not limited to upcoming reservations, purchases and deliveries, and cancelled or rescheduled appointments.",
      "How to opt out",
      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section. Users should then uncheck \"Turn on smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet,\" and then save their changes.",

    "summary": "The White House says structural issues and decay had made it unfeasible to save the East Wing.",
    "story": [
      "The White House said Thursday that it was not feasible to save the building's East Wing because of structural issues, past decay and other major concerns, as officials shared details of President Trump's planned ballroom at a public meeting of the planning commission charged with approving it.",
      "It was the most comprehensive explanation to date for the dramatic demolition of the East Wing in October to make way for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom. The demolition caused a public stir when it began in October with little advance notice, drawing criticism from Democrats and historic preservation groups.",
      "Josh Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, ticked off a list of problems in explaining why it was more economical to tear down the East Wing than to renovate it, saying that there were \"significant deficiencies and overall poor structural design and construction.\"",
      "\"The colonnade was structurally unstable. The roof systems had exceeded their service life, and the underpinnings were not sufficient to support the necessary upgrades,\" Fisher told members of the National Capital Planning Commission. \"In the East Wing, there was chronic water intrusion, accelerated deterioration and mold contamination. The electrical infrastructure was obsolete, deemed undersized and non-compliant with current code. Facilities were also non-compliant with both ADA and Secret Service requirements.\"",
      "\"Because of this and other factors, the cost analysis proved that demolition and reconstruction provided the lowest total cost ownership and most effective long-term strategy,\" Fisher continued.",
      "The project's architect, Shalom Baranes, joined other construction and White House officials in presenting a detailed plan to the commission Thursday about what the new ballroom would look like. They said its design is expected to include adding a second story to the colonnade outside the West Wing, which would help make the building more uniform with the new ballroom being built on the other side of the White House. It would also dramatically alter the iconic space outside the Oval Office.",
      "Baranes told the commission that the heights of the White House and ballroom \"will match exactly.\"",
      "The project also will include a new visitors' entry complex, which is meant to speed access to those coming to the White House to use the new ballroom and ensure that they won't have to mill around under the tents or other temporary structures that are currently sometimes erected for large gatherings.",
      "Some of the 12 commission members raised concerns, particularly Commissioner Phil Mendelson, who asked if the planned size and location of the ballroom might change going forward. He was told that \"anything's possible\" but that the existing plans had been studied very thoroughly.",
      "Mendelson, who also serves as chairman of the D.C. Council, then asked if the planned ceiling height of 38 to 40 feet (11.5 to 12 meters) could still be lowered before the final structure is finished and received assurances that the number wasn't fully set.",
      "\"It still seems to me it's overwhelming the existing building,\" Mendelson said.",
      "Upon its completion, the ballroom is expected to be larger than the rest of the existing White House. Will Scharf, a top White House aide who has been tapped by Mr. Trump to head the commission, seemed to listen to the questions and concerns Mendelson raised.",
      "Mendelson also asked why the project hadn't been presented in its entirety to the commission before demolition of the East Wing began. Fisher said some things about the ballroom's construction were of a \"top secret nature.\" Scharf repeated his past assertions that the planning commission doesn't usually have jurisdiction over site work and demolition on any project, including those at the White House.",
      "He pointed to recent work at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, which he said was an example of demolition beginning before the commission fully approved plans.",
      "Scharf acknowledged that the ballroom project had prompted \"agitation\" from some quarters, saying it had sparked \"passionate comments on both sides\" while also noting that public comment wouldn't be part of Thursday's session.",
      "But commissioners were allowed to ask questions and give feedback, with a more formal review expected in the spring that would include public testimony and votes. The commission's next meeting is Feb. 5.",
      "After commissioner questions, Scharf defended the project, arguing that the White House needed a larger and more elegant space to hold visitors. He recalled visiting Windsor Castle last year with Mr. Trump, and noted that the president would eventually be hosting King Charles III of Great Britain.",
      "\"More likely than not, he will be hosted in a tent on the south lawn with porta-potties,\" Scharf said.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Scharf said, \"Our concern is not so much about whether a ballroom is a good idea or not. I obviously believe that it is.\"",
      "\"Our concerns are how will that impact the public viewing experience, the visitor experience,\" he said. \"How will this new building interact with the other existing buildings in the area and more broadly in the city.\"",
      "The White House in December submitted its ballroom plans to the commission, which is one of two federal panels that review construction on federal land \u2014 usually before ground is broken.",
      "The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to halt construction of the $400 million ballroom, accusing the Trump administration of violating federal laws by proceeding before submitting the project for the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment.",
      "A summary on the commission's website said the purpose of the project is to \"establish a permanent, secure event space within the White House grounds\" that provides increased capacity for official state functions, eliminates reliance on temporary tents and support facilities, and \"protects the historic integrity and cultural landscape of the White House and its grounds.\"",
      "A comprehensive design plan for the White House prepared in 2000 identified the \"need for expanded event space to address growing visitor demand and provide a venue suitable for significant events,\" the summary said. And it said successive administrations had \"recognized this need as an ongoing priority.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has been talking about building a White House ballroom for years. Last July, the White House announced a 90,000-square-foot (8,400-square-meter) space would be built on the east side of the complex to accommodate 650 seated guests at a then-estimated cost of $200 million. Trump has said it will be paid for with private donations, including from him.",
      "But he later increased the ballroom's capacity to 999 people and by October, had demolished the two-story East Wing of the White House to build it there. In December, he raised the price tag for the project to $400 million \u2014 twice the original estimate.",
      "The White House has announced few other details about the project but has said it would be completed before Mr. Trump's term ends in January 2029. The president has said the ballroom will be big enough for future presidential inaugurations to be held there and has also said it will have security features, such as bulletproof glass.",
      "While he was in Florida last week, the president bought marble and onyx for the ballroom \"at his own expense,\" the White House said. The cost was not disclosed.",

      "The victim has been identified as 37-year-old Renee Good, a U.S. citizen who moved to the Twin Cities from the Kansas City area. City leaders said she was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and wasn't a target for an ICE-related arrest.The shooting is being investigated by the FBI exclusively. On Thursday, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it had been conducting a joint investigation with the FBI, but the federal agency then \"reversed course,\" adding \"the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\" Gov.

      "The victim has been identified as 37-year-old Renee Good, a U.S. citizen who moved to the Twin Cities from the Kansas City area. City leaders said she was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and wasn't a target for an ICE-related arrest.",
      "The shooting is being investigated by the FBI exclusively. On Thursday, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it had been conducting a joint investigation with the FBI, but the federal agency then \"reversed course,\" adding \"the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\" Gov.

      "A C-SPAN live stream captured the moment during a break on the House floor. It shows Craig getting face-to-face with Emmer, starting an animated argument.",
      "She told WCCO she wanted to address what she viewed as Emmer's lack of standing up for Minnesotans, after he made several posts\u00a0Wednesday on Facebook defending ICE's actions in the state, including the deadly shooting.",
      "\"I'm not going to let my Republican colleagues get away with just ignoring the fact that someone, Renee Good, a woman in Minnesota, was killed yesterday because of these political stunts,\" she said.",

      "Things got so heated between the two House members that someone eventually stepped between Craig and Emmer. Then, fellow Democratic Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum pulled Craig back to separate them.",
      "In an interview with WCCO, Craig said that her emotions during their exchange were fueled by what she saw in the videos of the ICE shooting.",
      "When asked how Emmer responded to her, Craig said, \"Well, Tom didn't let me get three words out before he went from zero to 60 mph. So, look, if you can't have a conversation with someone without it escalating in the first three words, then you're not really ready to have a conversation and you're not listening.

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A planned spacewalk outside the International Space Station was scrapped because of what NASA called a \"medical concern\" with an unidentified crew member.",
    "story": [
      "Four space station fliers have been told to cut their mission short and return to Earth ahead of schedule because of an apparently serious medical issue affecting an unidentified crew member, NASA announced Thursday.",
      "\"Yesterday, January 7, a single crew member on board the station experienced a medical situation and is now stable,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a news conference.",
      "\"After discussions with Chief Health and Medical Officer Dr. J.D. Polk and leadership across the agency, I've come to the decision that it's in the best interest of our astronauts to return Crew 11 ahead of their planned departure (in mid February). ... We expect to provide a further update within the next 48 hours as to the expected, anticipated undock and re-entry timeline.\"",
      "In keeping with the agency's strict medical privacy policy, NASA officials have not identified the astronaut in question or provided any details about the nature of the medical issue.",
      "But the ailing astronaut is a member of NASA's Crew 11, made up of commander Zena Cardman, veteran astronaut Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "They were launched to the International Space Station on Aug. 1 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship. They were planning to return to Earth around Feb. 20, after their Crew 12 replacements arrive.",
      "Fincke and Cardman were planning to venture outside the space station on Thursday to complete a support truss for an add-on solar array and to carry out a variety of other tasks.",
      "But on Wednesday, NASA announced the spacewalk had been called off due to a \"medical concern\" with one of the Crew 11 astronauts. The agency said the crew member was \"stable,\" but no other details were provided.",
      "Polk said Thursday that the astronaut in question was not injured or made ill by any operational aspect of living aboard the space station, adding that spacewalk preparations played no role in the incident.",
      "Isaacman said the planned early return of Crew 11 did not represent an \"emergency,\" adding the agency was simply erring on the side of caution to ensure the health and well-being of the astronaut. Even so, Crew 11's early return will mark the first time in U.S. space history that a mission has been cut short due to a medical issue.",
      "Polk agreed it was not an emergency, adding \"This is not an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations, but unrelated to the operational environment that we have right now. It's mostly having a medical issue in the difficult areas of microgravity and with the suite of hardware that we have at our disposal available to complete a diagnosis.\"",
      "Space station crews have extensive medical equipment on board and crew members are trained to serve as medical officers.",
      "Physician and former astronaut Tom Marshburn told CBS News that space station crews are \"equipped to deal with all the things that have happened in space over the 65 years of human spaceflight, any of those things that come up. Even to the some extreme examples, like a heart attack, something like that. We have the tools to do it.",
      "\"We just can't sustain somebody sick for a really long period of time, just for a few days, perhaps. But pretty much any medical event that you can imagine ... could happen up there, yeah.\"",
      "Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, said Crew 11 will follow normal procedures when returning to Earth where they will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast. SpaceX support crews and NASA flight surgeons will be standing by aboard the company's Crew Dragon recovery ship. The crew will be flown to shore by helicopter and then fly by jet back to the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"As Dr. Polk mentioned, it's the first time we've done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle, so that is unusual,\" Kshatriya said. \"What's important to us is the whole crew, and we don't want to do anything, given the nature of the condition, that we put any other additional risk on the crew by diverging from our normal processes. So that's why we're doing essentially a controlled expedited return.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven. Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flier gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "Because of the ever-present chance that a Soyuz or Crew Dragon might have to depart early, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon.",
      "The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one spacecraft depart early and take all its crew members with it.",
      "For that reason, after Crew 11 undocks from the station, NASA will still have one astronaut \u2014 Chris Williams \u2014   aboard to operate systems in the lab's U.S. modules. He was launched to the outpost in November aboard a Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "A one-time volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician with a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, Williams was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams would be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are scheduled for launch Feb. 15.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for takeoff as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",
      "The high-profile Artemis 2 mission will be the first to send astronauts to the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years. Isaacman said he did not think the early return of Crew 11 and the possibly early launch of Crew 12 would have any impact on the moon mission.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:06:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The House approved a three-year extension of expired health care tax credits, with increased Republican support.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House approved on Thursday a three-year extension of health care tax credits that expired at the end of last year, with a group of Republicans joining Democrats to propel the measure to passage in the lower chamber.",
      "In a 230 to 196 vote, 17 Republicans joined all Democrats in favor of the measure. The legislation is unlikely to pass the Senate in its current form, but some lawmakers are hopeful it will serve as the starting point for a broader compromise.",
      "\"Today, let's celebrate a victory of getting something done,\" Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York told reporters Thursday. \"And then, we'll start working on the policy issue next week related to what's the common ground in the Senate that we can get to the next step.\"",
      "The outcome came after four Republicans crossed the aisle last month, revolting against their leadership to join Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. The Affordable Care Act tax credits subsidized premiums for millions of Americans who have coverage in state-run exchanges. One analysis found that premiums were set to double without the enhanced credits.",
      "The tax credits' extension was at the center of the government shutdown, which stretched through October and into November to become the longest in history. After a handful of Senate Democrats broke with their party to end the shutdown without securing an extension for the enhanced tax credits, House Democrats pushed ahead on an effort of their own \u2014 but needed GOP support to make it successful.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, led the effort to force the vote with a discharge petition in the final weeks of the year. Moderate Republicans have generally criticized a straight extension of the tax credits without reforms. But a handful of GOP members signed onto the petition, arguing that an extension of the tax credits without reforms was preferable to letting them expire.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler of New York was one of the four Republicans who signed onto the petition last month, along with Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Ryan Mackenzie and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania.",
      "\"We endeavored in a bipartisan negotiation after the shutdown to come up with a compromise bill that would extend the subsidies, but put in place necessary reforms,\" Lawler told reporters Tuesday. \"Unfortunately, we couldn't get a vote on that before Christmas, and so the only alternative was to sign the three-year discharge.\"",
      "The moderate Republicans are banking on the measure being a vehicle for a compromise bill in the Senate.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that when we pass the discharge through the House, the Senate will be able to use that vehicle and garner enough support to get a bipartisan compromise across the finish line,\" Lawler said.",
      "The search for a Senate compromise",
      "A number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have been seeking a solution on health care costs. And the discharge petition added momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise before lawmakers broke for recess in December. Now, lawmakers are looking to the Senate to move ahead with a long-sought agreement to extend the credits, with some reforms.",
      "The Senate rejected a Democrat-led effort to pass a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits last month. Republicans offered an alternative plan to send funds directly to consumers through health savings accounts that also fell short. But a number of Senate Republicans expressed willingness to reach a compromise.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who's been involved in the discussions, told reporters on Tuesday that \"we're continuing to work hard\" on a compromise measure. She said parts of the measure would be similar to what she and Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, originally proposed last month. That plan would extend the tax credits for two years, with some reforms in the first year and then \"more substantial reforms\" in the second.",
      "Moreno outlined the emerging deal Thursday, telling reporters that it would include a two-year extension of the enhanced tax credits and an extension of the open enrollment period until March 1. It would also impose a new income eligibility cap for the subsidies at 700% of the federal poverty level; a $5 per month or $60 per year minimum premium; and a $100,000 fine of insurance companies \"for deliberately causing fraud\" by signing someone up without their consent. In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account.",
      "Leaving a bicameral meeting of the so-called \"problem solvers\" on Thursday, multiple lawmakers said they expected language from the compromise bill to be released next week.",
      "Asked after Thursday's vote whether he would back such a deal, Jeffries told reporters that House Democrats are \"focused on a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits at the moment.\"",
      "\"But we've always said that we will consider in good faith anything that emerges from the Senate in a bipartisan way, if it decisively deals with the Republican health care crisis, including by providing a meaningful extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, asked about the timeline for addressing the tax credits in the upper chamber, told reporters Wednesday that the conversations among the bipartisan group of lawmakers have been productive and \"we'll see where the discussions are going.\"",
      "\"There's some thorny issues they have to resolve,\" the South Dakota Republican said. \"You got to deal with reforms, you got to deal with a bridge to an HSA, and then obviously, Hyde is a big, big challenge.\"",
      "President Trump encouraged Republicans in Congress to be \"flexible\" on the Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions, in order to find a solution on health care costs. But conservatives in Congress haven't expressed willingness to move on the issue, seeking additional Hyde amendment language within the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges.",
      "\"There's no flexibility. You're either using public funds to pay for abortion or you're not. We're not sure there's a compromise available on that,\" Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Thune said while Collins and Moreno are trying to address the challenging issues, there isn't \"a landing spot just yet.\"",
      "\"The conversations are constructive,\" he added. \"But at this point, there's nothing that I'm aware of that we'll be voting on soon.\"",

    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines said that it will no longer carry out migrant deportation flights for the Department of Homeland Security, ending a contract that supported the U.S. government's immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "The Houston-based carrier, founded in 2021, said its deal to handle Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights did not sufficiently boost the airline's financial position. As a result, the low-cost carrier is shutting down its hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where its migrant flight operation was based, the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Avelo will close the base at [Mesa Gateway Airport] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,\" an Avelo spokesperson said. \"The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.\"",
      "Avelo operates low-cost flights to dozens of destinations, including the Caribbean, from four U.S. hubs. It is planning to open a fifth base in Dallas in late 2026.",
      "DHS has long partnered with CSI Aviation, which subcontracted with Avelo to provide ICE with air charter services. The federal agency also subcontracts with other charter companies, including GlobalX, which handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "\"ICE never contracted directly with Avelo Airlines,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News. \"ICE will continue to utilize its contracted service provider, which works with multiple airlines to support the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "In April, Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy expressed confidence that the airline's deportation business would help drive the carrier's growth, while conceding that handling deportation flights was a \"sensitive and complicated topic.\"",
      "Mesa's charter program has sparked public backlash and protests against its decision to work with ICE.",
      "The Indivisible Project, a nonprofit group that led protests against Avelo Airlines, on Thursday applauded the carrier's move to end its contract with DHS.",
      "\"For months, communities across the country spoke out, organized, protested and demanded that Avelo Airlines end its deportation flights.

    "summary": "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Minnesota authorities \"don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem held a news conference Thursday in New York City one day after U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement officer fatally shot a U.S. citizen during an operation in Minneapolis. Noem announced the \"takedown\" of dozens of people suspected to be connected to the Dominican Republic-based gang Trinitarios.",
      "But it was the\u00a0shooting death\u00a0of\u00a037-year-old Renee Good\u00a0in Minneapolis that was the focus of reporters' questions, as the incident has sparked protests in the Twin Cities and elsewhere, including New York. Noem said Wednesday that the actions of the woman who was shot constituted a \"domestic act of terrorism.\" On Thursday, Noem said the ICE officer involved \"did follow his training.\"",
      "\"This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,\" she said.",
      "The ICE agent who opened fire yesterday is based in Minneapolis and has over 10 years of experience, a senior DHS official told CBS News. He is a member of the ICE ERO Special Response Team (SRT), a specially trained tactical unit within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.",
      "The same agent was involved in a separate incident in June where, according to a senior DHS official, he was dragged by a vehicle while trying to apprehend a fleeing suspect. According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025, incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "Minnesota officials say the FBI has blocked them from accessing key information. Noem said local authorities in Minnesota have not been \"cut out\" of the investigation.",
      "\"They have not been cut out,\" she said. \"They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "The Trump administration has\u00a0deployed about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents\u00a0to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region to crack down amid the\u00a0state's fraud scandal.",
      "Trump administration officials have said the shooting was in self-defense, while Minneapolis' mayor and Minnesota's governor have indicated otherwise after footage of the incident was posted online. The city of Minneapolis said police responded to a call reporting a shooting around in a Minneapolis neighborhood, and upon arrival, found that a woman in a vehicle had been shot in the head. She was pronounced dead at a local hospital.",
      "On Wednesday, Noem said any loss of life is a \"tragedy\" but alleged that this incident was \"preventable.\"",
      "\"ICE officers and agents approached the vehicle of the individual in question, who was blocking the officers in with her vehicle,\" Noem said Wednesday night. \"And she had been stalking and impeding their work all throughout the day. ICE agents repeatedly ordered her to get out of the car and to stop obstructing law enforcement, but she refused to obey their commands. She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.\"",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey expressed outrage\u00a0over the shooting, directing a message to federal immigration officials \u2014 \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "Noem on Thursday said Frey \"chose to stand with illegals\" with his statements, and criticized Democratic officials in Minnesota for their responses to the incident.",
      "Regarding the arrests and deportations of people suspected to be connected to Trinitarios, Noem said the group is behind the July 2025 shooting of an off-duty Customs and Border Protection officer in Manhattan. Federal authorities said the vast majority of those people had either charges or convictions, and all were in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"We've arrested 54 individuals as a part of Operation Salvo since its inception just a few months ago,\" Noem said. \"Those arrested are violent transnational gang members and affiliates associated with Trinitarios who are responsible for weapons trafficking, for human smuggling, for narcotics distribution and for armed robberies. They had perpetuated previous violent attacks across the city of New York City.\"",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman Wednesday morning during an operation in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Trump described the shooting as self-defense, but the mayor and governor disputed that, citing videos from the scene.",
      "The shooting comes as the Trump administration\u00a0has deployed\u00a0about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as part of a crackdown on the\u00a0state's fraud scandal\u00a0and immigration.",
      "Here's more of what we've learned about the shooting so far.",
      "Woman who was shot, Renee Good, was a 37-year-old U.S. citizen",
      "The city of Minneapolis said police responded to a call reporting a shooting at about 9:30 a.m. local time in a south Minneapolis neighborhood and found that a woman in a vehicle had been shot in the head.",
      "Minneapolis firefighters rushed the woman to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died, the city said.",
      "The woman who was killed was identified as 37-year-old Renee Good, a mother of three who had recently moved to the area with her partner and 6-year-old son.",
      "Her ex-husband\u00a0told The Associated Press\u00a0that Good had just dropped the child off at school and was driving home with her partner when she encountered the ICE agents.",
      "She was a U.S. citizen, federal sources confirmed to CBS News. Minnesota city leaders said Good was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and wasn't a target for an ICE-related arrest.",
      "She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, her father, Timothy Granger, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. He said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her second husband.",
      "He described her as warm, witty, and with a bubbly personality, and as someone who always cared deeply about other people.",
      "CBS affiliate\u00a0KCTV\u00a0in Kansas City spoke to a former neighbor who knew Good when she lived there until 2024. She said Good lived there with her partner, their young son and their dogs, and had two older children who visited routinely. She said she didn't know the family well but called them \"lovely neighbors.\"",
      "Good graduated from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, in December 2020 with an English degree, the school said.",
      "Feds say she was shot during \"targeted operations\" by ICE",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement that the shooting occurred while ICE officers were conducting \"targeted operations.\"",
      "McLaughlin described the woman who was killed as one of several \"violent rioters\" who were \"blocking\" ICE officers.",
      "According to McLaughlin, the woman \"weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.\"",
      "An ICE officer, \"fearing for his life,\" then \"fired defensive shots,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "In a news conference following the shooting, Noem described the driver's actions as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\"",
      "Noem alleged the ICE officers had gotten stuck in snow and \"were attempting to push out their vehicle\" when \"a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social, also claiming that the shooting was self-defense, Mr. Trump alleged that the woman \"viciously ran over the ICE Officer\" before being shot. However, a video clip from a local newscast that Mr. Trump attached to the post showed no sign that an officer had been run over.",
      "Video, witness accounts and local and state officials challenge federal claims",
      "Statements from witnesses and local officials, who point to several videos of the encounter, dispute the accounts from federal officials of the circumstances that led up to the shooting.",
      "In a fiery news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey contested McLaughlin's narrative that the shooting was an act of self-defense, calling the federal government's account \"bull****.\"",
      "\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bulls***,\" Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"",
      "In another news conference, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had seen the video as well and also challenged the account of self-defense.",
      "\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz said. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"",
      "One video taken by a man at the scene and provided to CBS Minnesota shows the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV blocking the street with her car. An ICE agent walks behind the car and circles around to the passenger side of the vehicle.",
      "In another angle, she can be seen apparently attempting to wave someone to go around her before two agents then park their silver pickup truck and get out, walking towards the Honda's driver-side door.",
      "In that video, one of the officers from the pickup truck can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" as he approaches. He reaches for the Honda's door handle and the car starts moving in reverse. As the Honda is reversing, another agent moves in front of the vehicle from the opposite side. The Honda then starts to move forward, and the agent in front of the vehicle draws his weapon and fires into the Honda.",
      "That agent then moves to the side of the car, although it's unclear if he was hit or not, and fires two more shots as the car continues moving forward.",
      "The videos show the SUV driving off a bit further before crashing into another car down the street.",
      "Multiple witnesses reaffirmed what was seen in the videos and told CBS Minnesota that whistles had sounded to alert neighbors of ICE's presence at about 9:30 a.m.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are jointly investigating the shooting.",
      "ICE officer part of specially trained tactical unit",
      "A senior DHS official confirmed to CBS News that the agent who opened fire was a member of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Special Response Team \u2014 a specially trained tactical unit within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.",
      "Noem said the officer was taken to the hospital after the shooting and has since been released.",
      "\"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and drug him with a car back in June,\" Noem said. \"He sustained injuries at that time as well.\"",
      "According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025 incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.",
      "During that June incident, immigration officers in St. Paul were attempting to arrest a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, according to a senior DHS official.",
      "According to the official, the suspect refused to roll his window down or get out of his car, so the officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, the suspect drove off, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car. The suspect was accelerating and weaving to try to shake the officer off. The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. He was eventually knocked free of the vehicle, and suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, the official said. The suspect was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "Will the officer face charges or discipline?",
      "It was unclear if the officer would face any charges or discipline at the early stages of the investigation. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, however, criticized the Trump administration for allegedly\u00a0cutting state investigators out of the process.",
      "\"The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the BCA, spent the day yesterday trying to get that accountability. We have learned that the Trump administration has now denied the state that ability to participate in the investigation,\" Walz said at a Thursday news conference.",
      "\"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,\" he said of that decision, accusing Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Noem of making statements about the incident that are \"verifiably false.\"",
      "The BCA said in a statement it was initially invited to participate in the investigation but that the FBI later said it would be the sole lead and \"the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\"",
      "\"Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,\" the agency said.",
      "Noem, however, said Thursday, \"They have not been cut out. They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "\"This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,\" she added.",
      "Shooting prompts local outrage",
      "Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence. Many attended a vigil for Good, creating an impromptu memorial where the shooting occurred. Local officials implored those demonstrating to remain peaceful.",
      "In his news conference Wednesday, Frey had a blunt message to federal immigration officers, \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "\"They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,\" the mayor said.",
      "About 1,500 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents and 650 Homeland Security Investigations agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities in recent weeks, CBS News has learned, an increase 15 times the normal ICE presence in the region.",
      "Walz in his Wednesday news conference said the state \"doesn't need any further help from the federal government.\"",
      "\"To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough,\" Walz said.",
      "The governor also directed the Minnesota National Guard to prepare in the event that it was need to assist state and local authorities amid the fallout from the shooting.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a statement that \"ICE must stop terrorizing our communities.\"",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Mr. Trump's decision to send thousands of federal agents to Minnesota is \"causing serious harm and spreading terror\" through the community.",
      "Minneapolis Public Schools announced late Wednesday that, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" classes would be canceled districtwide for all schools both Thursday and Friday \"due to safety concerns related to today's incidents around the city.\" All after-school activities and athletics would be canceled as well.",

    "story": [
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday took aim at what he called a \"disconnect\" between Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's swift assessment of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer's shooting of a Minnesota woman, and ICE director Tom Homan's comment on \"CBS Evening News\" Wednesday that it would be \"unprofessional to pass judgment\" on the incident before a full review.",
      "Walz held a press conference Thursday as Minnesota officials and federal officials disagree over what happened during the incident as well as the handling of the investigation into the incident, with the FBI taking charge of the investigation. Noem on Wednesday characterized the woman's actions leading up to the shooting as constituting an \"act of domestic terrorism.\" Homan was initially more cautious in casting judgment, saying they should \"let the investigation play out,\" although he has since amended his assessment so that it matches up more closely with Noem's.",
      "\"No one less than Tom Homan said yesterday that It would be unprofessional to pass judgment ahead of time,\" Walz said Thursday. \"Now, the disconnect between what Tom Homan said and what Kristi Noem said needs to be rectified by the federal government.\"",
      "In his interview with CBS News on Wednesday, Homan said the investigation had \"just started\" and he was \"not going to make a judgment call on one video when there's a hundred videos out there.\"",
      "\"I wasn't on the scene,\" Homan continued. \"I'm not an officer that may have body cam video. It would be unprofessional to comment on what I think happened in that situation. Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation.\"",
      "Noem judged the situation far more quickly Wednesday, saying the woman was \"using a vehicle to try to kill an officer and his colleagues\" and, \"It was an act of domestic terrorism.",
      "On Thursday morning, Noem said she \"didn't see those comments\" by Homan but also said she understood that Homan \"put out a statement later as well.\"",
      "\"I'll let Tom speak to that, but all of us are on the same page in the fact that this law enforcement officer followed his training and that he defended and acted in defense of his life and those around him,\" Noem told reporters Thursday.",
      "In a statement released Wednesday night, Homan said, \"The incident in Minneapolis today is yet another tragic example of the results of the hateful rhetoric and violent attacks against the men and women of ICE and BP. These brave men and women are forced to conduct law enforcement operations in heightened threat environments every day. Like all Americans, our officers have a right to self defense.\"",
      "On Thursday, Walz had additional criticisms for Noem, President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, slamming their characterizations of the incident as \"verifiably false.\"",
      "Walz said the \"only way we find the answers is a thorough investigation.\" Walz said he's seen the video, but a thorough investigation will determine what happened before that.",
      "\"Very, very difficult for Minnesotans to think in any way this is going to be fair when Kristi Noem was judge, jury and basically executioner yesterday,\" Walz said Thursday. \"That's very, very difficult to think that they are going to be fair.\"",

      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters Wednesday the officer had been dragged by a car in an incident in June. In that incident, which took place on June 17, 2025, federal immigration officers attempted to arrest Roberto Carlos Munoz, a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, on an immigration warrant in St. Paul. As agents tried to conduct a traffic stop and take him into custody, Munoz refused orders to roll down his windows or exit the vehicle.",
      "An ICE ERO officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, Munoz put the vehicle in drive, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car as he accelerated and weaved to try to shake him off.",
      "The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. Eventually, the officer was freed when the vehicle knocked him out of the window and Munoz continued fleeing. The officer suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, and Munoz was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon. The ERO agent involved in this incident was the same agent that opened fire Thursday. He is based in Minneapolis and has over 10 years of experience.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "ICE Special Response Teams provide high-risk operational support for immigration enforcement actions, including executing arrest and search warrants, responding to barricaded subjects, transporting dangerous detainees, and assisting with riot control or disturbances at detention facilities. SRT members receive advanced training in tactical operations, firearms, defensive tactics and crowd control, and they are deployed when situations exceed the capabilities of standard ERO officers.",
      "CBS News has also asked DHS about the officer's disciplinary history.",
      "The shooting occurred at a time when agents have been accused of operating with impunity. When CBS News asked Customs and Border Protection Commander Chief Bovino late last year if any CBP or ICE agents had been disciplined as a result of recent immigration raids, he said that none had been. ICE's head of training, Caleb Vitello, also told us last month in an interview he has not seen any uptick in discipline or investigations.",
      "Under DHS policy, which was last updated in 2023, firearms may not be discharged solely to disable a moving vehicle, and shooting at a moving vehicle is tightly restricted to two narrow circumstances: When a person in the vehicle is using or imminently threatening deadly force by means other than the vehicle, or when the vehicle itself is being operated in a manner that poses an imminent threat, and no other objectively reasonable defensive option exists. This explicitly includes \"moving out of the path of the vehicle,\" the policy says.",
      "As one former senior Homeland Security Investigations agent put it: \"I've been conducting stops and approaches for 25 years \u2026 I never ever wanted to be intentionally in front of the vehicle.\"",
      "There's a tactical expectation that officers avoid self-created jeopardy and, when feasible, they're supposed to try to distance and make angles between themselves and a threat.",
      "Meanwhile, the plaintiffs behind a landmark injunction in Chicago limiting immigration agents' use of force are set to dismiss their lawsuit, even as federal officials signal renewed enforcement surges in major cities.",
      "The case curbed chemical weapons, required body cameras and clear IDs, but now ends without a final ruling. The plaintiffs are dropping their suit not because their concerns have been addressed, but because the 7th Circuit signaled it was likely to overturn it, risking a bad precedent.",
      "In practical terms, this means ICE and Border Patrol are no longer legally bound by the injunction's requirements to limit chemical agents, wear body cameras, or clearly identify themselves. The government does not admit wrongdoing and federal agents can resume the same tactics that were challenged.",
      "The Trump administration's deployment of about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area is part of a crackdown on Minnesota's fraud scandal and immigration.",

      "The new probe, which is in its early stages, marks the latest effort by the Justice Department to target one of President Trump's perceived political enemies, after she pursued a civil fraud case against him while he was out of power.",
      "The latest investigation, which was first reported by the New York Times, centers on financial transactions between James and her long-time hairdresser Iyesata Marsh, the sources said.",

      "\"Clearly frustrated by the string of failures in carrying out President Trump's political vendetta against Attorney General James, his obedient Justice Department appears to be using its vast resources to try to shake down people based on their association with Ms. James,\" Lowell said in a statement to CBS News. \"Like their earlier attempts, this attack on Ms. James is doomed to fail. The desperation of those working for Trump is palpable and makes indelible the stain already put on this Justice Department. This abuse of justice must end.\"",

      "The death of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday, has sparked national outcry.",
      "Her father, Timothy Granger, tells \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil that she was the kind of person who always cared deeply about other people. He described her as warm, witty, and with a bubbly personality.",
      "She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, and had three children of her own \u2014 two from her first marriage and a 6-year-old from her second. Her father said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her husband.",
      "Good, who was a U.S. citizen, was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and was not a target for arrest by ICE agents, city leaders said.",
      "Her first husband told The Associated Press that she had just dropped her 6-year-old off at school and was driving home with her partner when she encountered the ICE agents.",
      "Good's father said the orphaned child has a loving extended family and will be \"well taken care of.\"",
      "Here's more about what we know so far about Good and the fatal shooting.",
      "A \"poet and writer and wife and mom\" who recently moved to Minneapolis",
      "Renee Good described herself in the bio of her Instagram profile as a \"poet and writer and wife and mom\" who was currently \"experiencing Minneapolis.\"",
      "Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that the family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning. Ganger told the newspaper that her daughter wasn't part of a protest and said her daughter \"was probably terrified.\"",
      "\"Renee was one of the kindest people I've ever known,\" Ganger told the Tribune. \"She was extremely compassionate. She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"",
      "After working briefly in banking in Colorado, her father said she moved east got a degree from Old Dominion University in Virginia, becoming a poet and English teacher. She was working as a substitute teacher in Minneapolis, he said.",
      "Her ex-husband told the AP that Good had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union before spending some time as a stay-at-home mother in recent years.",
      "Good was widowed when her husband Timmy Ray Macklin Jr. died in 2023 at age 36, the Tribune reported. He was the father of her 6-year-old son; AP reported that Good's two older children are a 12-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter.",
      "Good graduated from Old Dominion in December 2020 and received a poetry prize from the university, its English department announced in a Facebook\u00a0post\u00a0that year. The post said Good studied creative writing and hosted a podcast.",
      "\"It is with great sadness that Old Dominion University mourns the loss of one of our own, Renee (Macklin) Good,\" said Brian Hemphill, the university's president, in a\u00a0statement.\u00a0Hemphill described her death as a \"tragic killing\" and \"yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation.\"",
      "AP also reports it appears she was never charged with anything involving law enforcement beyond a traffic ticket.",
      "\"Devastated for that whole family\"",
      "Joan Rose, who was Good's former neighbor in Kansas City, Missouri, told CBS affiliate\u00a0KCTV\u00a0that Good's family had lived across the street from her until December 2024. Rose said she didn't know the family well but called them \"lovely neighbors.\" Good had lived in the Waldo neighborhood with her partner, young son and dogs, and Rose said the two older children routinely visited them.",
      "Rose said she thought Good's family had planned to move to Canada when they left Missouri last year.",
      "\"I heard they were moving to Canada because of the politics here,\" she told KCTV. \"I had thought about them sometimes, you know, passing by their house thinking, 'Oh, I hope they're OK in Canada, you know, I hope that they're living, you know, a good life and that they're, they're worry free.' And this is just the opposite of that. So, I'm just devastated for that whole family.\"",
      "A GoFundMe campaign established in the wake of the shooting is asking the public to \"support the wife and son of Renee Good as they grapple with the devastating loss of their wife and mother.\"",
      "\"Renee was pure sunshine, pure, love,\" reads the fundraiser's description. \"She will be desperately missed.\"",
      "The campaign has raised nearly $500,000 as of Thursday morning.",
      "A community vigil held for Good in Minneapolis Wednesday night drew a large crowd of attendees, many of whom shared emotional and frustrated remarks about the latest ICE operations that have recently ramped up across the region,\u00a0CBS Minnesota\u00a0reported. Protests also took place in other cities around the U.S.",
      "The agent involved in the shooting was part of a surge of roughly 2,000 federal agents and officers\u00a0the Trump administration recently deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in a response to both immigration and Minnesota's\u00a0fraud scandal.",
      "Shooting captured on video",
      "Police responded to a call reporting the shooting, which happened in a neighborhood in south Minneapolis, at about 9:30 a.m. local time Wednesday, according to the city. When officers arrived, they found that a woman, later identified as Good, had been shot in the head. She was rushed by firefighters to a Minneapolis hospital, where she later died, the city said.",
      "Federal officials, including Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, characterized the shooting as an act of self-defense on the part of the ICE agent who fired the weapon when the driver \"attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\" However, numerous witnesses and local leaders are questioning that account.",
      "Multiple videos have circulated online of the incident, which show the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV on a residential street when an ICE agent approached and addressed her through the window of her vehicle. Several other agents stood nearby.",
      "In one of the videos, an officer can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" before reaching for the Honda's door handle. At that point, the Honda is seen backing up as another agent steps in front of the car. The Honda then begins to drive away, and the agent in front of it fires his weapon into the car. Whether the agent was hit by the car, as federal officials have said, is not clear based on the videos. They show the agent move to the side of the SUV as he fires several more shots, and the car moves forward down the street before crashing into another car.",
      "The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it was originally assigned to investigate Good's death jointly with FBI, but the state agency has since withdrawn from the case and alleged federal authorities restricted its access to evidence, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "The BCA said the U.S. Attorney's Office \"reversed course\" and informed the agency that \"the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday failed to override two of President Trump's vetoes of bipartisan bills, with Republicans largely sticking by the president to uphold his decision to block the legislation.",
      "Both bills initially passed the House and Senate unanimously. Thursday's votes required a two-thirds majority to override the vetoes, but both fell significantly short.",
      "One of the pieces of legislation would have given the Miccosukee Tribe more control over a portion of the Florida Everglades, and the second would have funded a water pipeline in southeast Colorado. The president vetoed both in December.",
      "The vote to override Mr. Trump's veto of the Florida bill was 236 in favor to 188 opposed. The vote on the veto of the Colorado bill was 248 to 177.",
      "In a message to Congress, Mr. Trump explained the vetoes were aimed at \"ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts.\" But some lawmakers viewed the blocking of the bills as retaliation over political disagreements.",
      "The president tied his decision on the Florida bill in part to the tribe's opposition to his immigration policies. Last year, the Miccosukee Tribe joined a lawsuit challenging an immigration detention center, known as \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" in the Everglades. The tribe argued the detention center could have adverse effects on the environment.",
      "\"Despite seeking funding and special treatment from the federal government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected,\" Mr. Trump said in his notification to Congress. \"My administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"",
      "In Colorado, Mr. Trump has lashed out at officials over the case of Tina Peters, a former state election official who is imprisoned on state charges for tampering with voting machines during the 2020 election.",
      "Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado sponsored the legislation to help local governments pay for the Arkansas Valley Conduit water pipeline. She was also one of the GOP lawmakers who helped force the release of the Epstein files, resisting pressure from the White House to back down.",
      "Boebert criticized Mr. Trump's veto, saying he was \"denying clean drinking water to 50,000 people in southeast Colorado, many of whom enthusiastically voted for him in all three elections.\"",

    "summary": "The House easily passed legislation to fund several federal agencies and programs as lawmakers work to avert another government shutdown later this month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House easily approved bipartisan legislation Thursday to fund several federal agencies and programs through September as lawmakers work to avert the threat of another government shutdown later this month.",
      "In a 397 to 28 vote, lawmakers approved the three-bill package, known as a \"minibus,\" which House and Senate negotiators released earlier this week. The package includes funding for science initiatives and the Departments of Commerce and Justice; energy and water development; and the Department of Interior and the EPA.",
      "Congress has until Jan. 30 to fund major parts of the government, after lawmakers approved a short-term funding measure to end the longest government shutdown in history in November. That three-bill package funded parts of the government through September and extended funding for the remaining nine appropriations bills on a temporary basis.",
      "Negotiations have hit snags at several points in the weeks since. The latest funding package was split in two after a conservative rebellion threatened to stall the legislation.",
      "House conservatives had expressed opposition to earmarks within the package. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, blasted funding for specific projects in Democrats' districts, while lauding his work to prevent an \"outrageous\" earmark for an organization in Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar's district.",
      "To appease conservatives, GOP leaders agreed to separate the Commerce, Justice and science portion from the other two bills. The maneuver gave conservatives an opportunity to vote against the Commerce, Justice and science portion \u2014 which includes provisions they disapprove of \u2014 while voting in favor of the other measures.",
      "In a 375 to 47 vote, the House approved the Commerce, Justice and science piece of the legislation. The portion dealing with energy and water development, the Department of Interior and the EPA passed 419 to 6. The House then voted to recombine the bills and send the final version to the Senate.",
      "The path to averting a partial government shutdown",
      "The Senate is expected to take up the package as soon as next week, with dwindling time to address the remaining funding bills.",
      "Besides the three bills and the package passed in November, Congress has six other funding measures to assemble and approve before the end of the month. And if all funding isn't approved before the deadline, lawmakers may be forced to again extend funding on a temporary basis to avoid a partial shutdown of the unfunded agencies.",
      "Both chambers are expected to forge ahead quickly in the coming weeks. House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference Wednesday that the lower chamber plans to take up three more funding bills next week and go from there.",
      "\"With just three weeks to go until the funding deadline, we are very hopeful, very bullish, that this package of bills is going to continue our good momentum toward completing annual apportions with regular order without a bloated, wasteful omnibus spending bill,\" Johnson said.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the Senate, said that the next package is expected to include funding for the Department of Homeland Security; the State Department and foreign operations; and financial services and general government. The final package, Collins said, would then include funding for the Departments of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; and Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.",

      "\"Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders,\" Warner Bros. Discovery's board said in a statement.",
      "The rebuff is the second from Warner Bros. Discovery of Paramount Skydance's efforts to acquire the storied studio, which has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and owns cable networks including CNN and TNT.",
      "Paramount Skydance, the parent company of CBS News, owns the Paramount studios and cable networks including Comedy Central and Nickelodeon.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery in December rebuffed Paramount Skydance's most recent hostile bid, citing a lack of personal backing from the Ellison family.",

      "But on Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery turned down the latest offer as well, stating that Paramount Skydance's bid posed \"significant costs, risks and uncertainties\" compared with the Netflix merger. Warner Bros. Discovery also said Paramount Skydance's offer would burden the combined company with significant debt.",
      "On Thursday, January 8, Paramount Skydance said it is sticking with its current offer, reiterating the company's belief that the bid is \"superior to WBD's existing agreement with Netflix.\"",
      "\"Our offer clearly provides WBD investors greater value and a more certain, expedited path to completion,\" David Ellison said in a statement. \"Throughout this process, we have worked hard for WBD shareholders and remain committed to engaging with them on the merits of our superior bid and advancing our ongoing regulatory review process.\"",
      "Netflix on Wednesday said it \"welcomed\" Warner Bros. Discovery's ongoing commitment to the companies' merger. The streaming service added that it has submitted its Hart-Scott-Rodino filing with U.S. agencies, which is required for a review of potential antitrust issues.",
      "Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO network, as well as its streaming and studios business, for $27.75 a share. Under the deal, Warner's cable division would be spun off into a separately run unit before the merger is completed.",

      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz implored the federal authorities to allow state investigators to work alongside them as they launch a probe\u00a0into the shooting death of a 37-year-old woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer\u00a0on Wednesday, after the\u00a0Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the FBI blocked them from accessing evidence.",
      "Walz, a Democrat, during a Thursday news conference, reiterated that the Trump administration denied the state the ability to participate in the investigation and urged them to reconsider.",
      "He questioned if Minnesotans would trust the outcome without state investigators' input.",
      "The FBI declined to comment on the\u00a0BCA statement.",
      "\"It feels now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,\" Walz said. \"I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment\u2014from the president, to the vice president to [Department of Homeland Security Secretary] Kristi Noem, who has stood and told you things that are verifiably false.\"",
      "Noem said the victim, Renee Good, attempted to run over an ICE officer with her car in what she claimed was an \"act of domestic terrorism.\" President Donald Trump\u00a0on his social media also claimed\u00a0she was a \"professional agitator\" who \"ran over\" an ICE officer who responded by shooting her in self-defense.",
      "Eyewitness video evidence from the scene at times contradicts those definitive statements and what occurred is in dispute. A retired ICE agent\u00a0who spent a quarter-century with federal law enforcement\u00a0told CBS News that the video he's seen of the incident leaves him with a number of concerns.",
      "The current\u00a0policy for ICE and DHS agents\u00a0outlines very narrow acceptable reasons for an officer to fire a weapon into a moving vehicle. Border czar Tom Homan said\u00a0he would not comment on what happened\u00a0before an investigation is complete.",
      "\"I don't have a predetermined notion. Yes, I saw the video. Yes, I saw that. But a thorough investigation will see what happened before that. It will take all factors in and come up with a fair and just conclusion. And we will accept that,\" Walz said. \"Very, very difficult for Minnesotans to think in any way this is going to be fair when Kristi Noem was judge, jury and basically executioner yesterday.\"",
      "Bob Jacobsen, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said the state BCA was initially invited to do a joint investigation, which is not uncommon and has been done before. He said the FBI has shared none of the investigative reports or evidence with state authorities.",
      "\"Wiithout any of that information or without any of that assistance from the FBI and the federal government, we would be at a loss to initiate and conduct a thorough investigation,\" Jacobsen explained. \"For us to be able to do that, it would be extremely difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014without cooperation from the federal government.\"",
      "That could impede the state from making the decision to file any criminal charges against the officer, Jacobsen said, citing the need for a full investigation.",
      "\"I will not as a public safety professional jump to any conclusions as to who is at fault in this,\" he told reporters. \"What I will say, though, is that unless we do that thorough investigation, unless we have access to all of that evidence, unless we have access to agents that were involved in that and to any witnesses\u2014without any of that, we would not be able to put together a quality investigation for any prosecutor to be able to make a determination as to whether or not someone should be charged with a crime.\"",
      "A source briefed on the matter told CBS News that the FBI is conducting interviews with eyewitnesses and federal officers at the scene, analyzing videos of what occurred from all angles, and are putting together a timeline of what happened.",
      "That person said the agency will turn over the evidence to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota and the Department of Homeland Security, where the officer is employed.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump lashed out at the five Republican senators who voted to advance a war powers resolution to limit his ability to further strike Venezuela without congressional approval, saying they \"should never be elected to office again.\"",
      "\"Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump wrote Thursday afternoon.",
      "The Senate voted 52 to 47 to advance Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia's\u00a0 resolution under the War Powers Act earlier Thursday, less than a week after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "The GOP senators who voted with Democrats to advance the measure were Todd Young of Indiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri.",
      "Mr. Trump's rebuke of Hawley is particularly striking, given the Missouri senator's history of staunch support for the administration's agenda in most other areas. Hawley was reelected to a second term in the Senate in 2024.",
      "At the Capitol, Hawley said he didn't take any offense to Mr. Trump's comments, adding \"I support the president.\"",
      "\"I understand he's ticked,\" Hawley told reporters. \"No president likes the War Powers Act.\"",
      "Paul also brushed off Mr. Trump's post, saying he's spoken with the president several times this week and his support of the war powers push isn't personal.",
      "\"On this issue, it's a constitutional debate,\" Paul told reporters. \"What I said to him is it's more of an academic debate than it is an anti-Donald Trump [debate]. I think it's easy for presidents to take things personally.\"",
      "There are still several steps before a vote on final passage of the Senate measure. Even if it makes it through the chamber, it would still have to clear the House, where few Republicans have shown a willingness so far to buck Mr. Trump on the issue.",
      "Two previous attempts to limit the president's authority last year amid strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats failed to earn enough GOP support to advance. But Mr. Trump's comments about having the U.S. \"run\" Venezuela and the concern that U.S. forces could be deployed there tipped the scales against him in the latest vote.",
      "\"I believe invoking the War Powers Act at this moment is necessary, given the president's comments about the possibility of 'boots on the ground' and a sustained engagement 'running' Venezuela, with which I do not agree,\" Collins said in a statement. The Maine Republican is up for reelection this year in a seat that will be critical to the GOP's hopes of retaining control of the Senate.",
      "\"A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump's goal of ending foreign entanglements,\" Young said in a statement.",

      "Vance said the new assistant attorney general will help coordinate an administration-wide effort to investigate potential fraudulent activity in federally-backed programs and bring charges. The assistant attorney general will not work out of the Justice Department, the vice president said. Instead, the position will be run out of the White House and overseen by President Trump and Vance, he said.",

For instance, state and federal quarterly estimated taxes typically must be postmarked by January 15, April 15, June 15 and September 15 to avoid late fees.",
      "The change is part of the postal agency's 10-year plan to reduce costs and restore profitability.

      "Taxpayers eager to receive their tax refunds should mark Jan. 26, 2026, on their calendars, as the IRS said Thursday it will begin accepting federal income tax filings on that date.",
      "Annual tax refunds are typically the largest checks that households receive each year, with last year's average payment amounting to almost $3,200, according to IRS data. This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check set to increase by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis.",
      "2025 tax returns will be impacted by a number of major changes signed into law through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act, which enacted a host of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025. These include eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "Federal income tax returns are due April 15, although people who need more time can file for an\u00a0automatic tax extension before that. An extension gives taxpayers until Oct. 15 to file, although any taxes owed must still be paid by April 15 to avoid penalties.",
      "When will you get your refund?",
      "The question on most taxpayers' minds is how long it will take for their refund to be deposited.",
      "That depends on whether a taxpayer files electronically or submits a paper return, as well as whether the IRS identifies any problems with a filing.",
      "People who file electronically typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. That means a taxpayer who files a Form 1040 on Jan. 26 could receive a refund by Feb. 16, assuming there are no issues with the return.",
      "Filers can use the IRS' \"Where's My Refund\" tool to check the status of their return, with the agency typically providing information about 24 hours after an electronic filing.",

      "Iranian authorities appeared to be cutting off internet access Thursday in the capital and some other regions of the country as mass protests and chanting against the government\u00a0continue. Multiple sources in Tehran told CBS News the internet was down in the capital.",
      "The NetBlocks monitoring organization said\u00a0at about 8:30 local time in Iran that its live data \"show #Iran  is now in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout; the incident  follows a series of escalating digital censorship measures targeting  protests across the country and hinders the public's right to  communicate at a critical moment.\"",
      "One CBS News source in the capital said there were \"huge crowds out across Tehran. Unprecedented,\" and confirmed that the internet was down for most people in the city. He said some people, with more robust, more reliable business accounts could still get online. Not long after, that source became unreachable, suggesting the blackout had widened even further.",
      "There were reports on social media, largely by anti-regime activists, that web service was also down or severely restricted in the cities of Esfahan, Lodegan, Abdanan, and parts of Shiraz.",
      "The web outages came as Iranians began chanting out of their windows against the regime, following a call by exiled Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former U.S.-backed shah, to make their voices heard at 8 p.m. local time (noon Eastern). Analysts and insiders told CBS News the scale of the response to Pahalvi's call could determine whether the deadly,\u00a012-day-old protests\u00a0fizzle out as previous rounds of unrest have, or grow into a major challenge to the government, and provoke a possible wider crackdown.",
      "\"All of the huge crowds in my neighborhood are pro-Pahlavi and from several areas my sources report the same \u2014 pro-Pahlavi crowds are prevailing, undeniably,\" the source in Tehran told CBS News, calling it \"monarchists responding to Reza.\"",
      "So far, the unrest has left at least 39 people dead, including at least four members of the security services, and seen more than 2,260 others detained, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "President Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Thursday that his administration is monitoring the protests in Iran. He threatened to take severe action if authorities kill protesters.",
      "\"I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots \u2014 they have lots of riots \u2014 if they do it, we are going to hit them very hard,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Speaking to reporters Thursday at the White House, Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. stands by anybody in Iran engaged in peaceful protest.

      "\"I'll let the president speak to what we're going to do in the future,\" Vance said.",

It remains tightly restricted, however. Social media sites such as TikTok, Facebook and X are officially banned, as is access to U.S. and European news sites, including CBS News.",

    "summary": "Five Republicans joined all Democrats in voted to advance the measure toward  toward limiting President Trump's ability to further strike Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 After two previous unsuccessful attempts, the Senate moved Thursday toward limiting President Trump's ability to further strike\u00a0Venezuela as the U.S. leader continues to take unilateral action against the South American country.",
      "The Senate voted 52 to 47 to advance a war powers resolution, days after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife in a nighttime raid that came not only as a surprise to the former president, but also to Congress.",
      "Five Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure: Todd Young of Indiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri.",
      "Another procedural vote and debate on the resolution is expected next week.",
      "Mr. Trump had long teased land strikes against Venezuela amid a monthslong military campaign against alleged drug-smuggling boats at sea that has killed more than 100 people. Mr. Trump has not ruled out additional military action. He has said that the U.S. will \"run\" the country for the time being and control its oil sales after Saturday's strikes, which were carried out as part of a daring operation to capture Maduro and bring him to the U.S. to face charges.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, introduced his latest resolution in early December, after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "\"The indication from the administration [is] that this is not a few days or a few weeks, it's likely a few years of U.S. occupation and involvement in this country,\" Kaine said Wednesday on the Senate floor. \"This is not an arrest warrant. This is far bigger than that.\"",
      "Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, held briefings for top lawmakers on Tuesday on last weekend's actions in the region. They held similar briefings for all members of Congress on Wednesday.",
      "Democrats left those briefings dissatisfied with the answers they received about what comes next.",
      "The boat strikes and Maduro's seizure and removal to the U.S. have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers, with some accusing the Trump administration of committing war crimes, lying about its intentions for regime change and leading the U.S. into a war without congressional authorization.",
      "\"I think bombing a capital and removing the head of state is by all definitions, war,\" Paul, the lone Republican cosponsor of the resolution, said Tuesday.",
      "Members of the Trump administration, including the president, have muddied the legal arguments by claiming that the operation to capture Maduro was a \"law enforcement\" operation that didn't require sign-off from Congress. Mr. Trump and other officials also say the U.S. is now in charge of Venezuela.",
      "Republicans who voted to advance the resolution cited Mr. Trump's comments about running Venezuela and the potential for U.S. forces to be deployed there as reasons for the measure gaining their support.",
      "\"I believe invoking the War Powers Act at this moment is necessary, given the president's comments about the possibility of 'boots on the ground' and a sustained engagement 'running' Venezuela, with which I do not agree,\" Collins said in a statement.",
      "\"A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump's goal of ending foreign entanglements,\" Young said in statement.",
      "Hawley told reporters after the vote, \"I just think if you're going to put troops in there for hostilities, you're going to have to get congressional approval.\"",
      "Many Republicans have defended the Trump administration's failure to seek approval from Congress, arguing the actions are well within the president's constitutional authority and limited in scope.",
      "\"This is not a regime change. This is demand for change of behavior by a regime,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said after Monday's classified briefing. \"We don't expect troops on the ground.\"",
      "Johnson added Wednesday, \"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. There's no dispute about that, of course, but we are not in a war in Venezuela.\"",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho called the resolution \"nonsense,\" and said \"the effect of this is to slap the president of the United States in the face.\"",
      "\"That is the only effect that this vote can have. It can have no practical effect, because it's trying to stop something that isn't going on,\" Risch added.",
      "Boat strikes scrutinized",
      "In the weeks before Maduro's capture, Mr. Trump dialed up his pressure campaign, seizing two sanctioned tankers that were carrying oil from Venezuela. On Wednesday, the U.S. carried out operations to seize two more vessels linked to Venezuela.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has voted against the war powers resolutions, suggested that if the U.S. can seize a giant oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, it could also seize smaller boats allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "\"I would take note, if we can take a big ship like this, we may be able to take a few boats, too, without blowing them out of the water,\" he told reporters last month. \"But that's a decision they have to make on the ground, I guess, based on the threat level.\"",
      "Paul, who has been a fierce critic of the strikes and has decried the lack of due process, shared a letter he received from the U.S. Coast Guard that said dozens of suspected drug smuggling vessels interdicted by the military branch possessed no illegal drugs. In total, 212 interdictions occurred between Sept. 1, 2024, and Oct. 7, 2025, according to the letter. Of those, 41 boats had \"no illicit contraband on board when interdicted,\" according to the Coast Guard.",
      "The letter also provided details on interceptions in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"Of the 212 total vessels interdicted during this period, 69 vessels were interdicted in the Caribbean Sea by Coast Guard surface assets, operating under Coast Guard law enforcement authority,\" the letter continued. \"Of these 69 interdictions, 14 had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted; 11 of those 14 vessels without contraband did not appear to commit any federal criminal offense. Of the 69 Caribbean interdictions, 14 vessels were indicted off the coast of Venezuela. Three of the 14 vessels interdicted near Venezuela had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted, but one of the three violated other U.S. federal criminal statutes.\"",
      "To justify the strikes, the Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. Lawmakers critical of the military action argue the rationale in the opinion is inadequate for the situation and have demanded that it be made public.",
      "In December, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order designating fentanyl as a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" perhaps seeking to bolster the justification for military action around Venezuela.",
      "Fentanyl was not mentioned in the indictment against Maduro.",

      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",

      "Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory:",
      "\"It's so strategic right now\"",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",

Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Most Greenlanders don't want to be American",

    "summary": "Pope Leo XIV, the Catholic Church's first ever American leader, appears to signal a more inclusive leadership style than his predecessor.",
    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014\u00a0Pope Leo XIV has summoned Catholic cardinals from around the world to the Vatican for a meeting called an \"extraordinary consistory,\" to seek their guidance on the Catholic Church's priorities for the years ahead.",
      "\"I am here to listen,\" Leo, a Chicago native and the first ever pope from the U.S., said Wednesday in his opening remarks. \"This day-and-a-half together will point the way for our path ahead.\"",
      "Of the 245 members of the College of Cardinals, 170 of the so-called \"princes of the church\" were in Vatican City to participate in the gathering.",
      "As it got underway, Leo asked the cardinals to select two of four possible topics for detailed discussions: The missionary nature of the church, further reforms of the Vatican bureaucracy, synodality and liturgy.",
      "A majority chose to prioritize the missionary and synodal themes over the liturgy or Vatican reforms, according to Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni. That means the consistory is likely to focus on how to make the church more missionary, and more responsive to the needs of the faithful.",
      "Significantly, the cardinals chose not to discuss liturgy, which would likely have seen them grapple with divisions within the church over the celebration of the traditional Latin Mass, which became a flashpoint after Pope Francis significantly restricted its use.",
      "The Latin Mass \u2014   also known as the Tridentine mass \u2014 is controversial because it represents a form of Catholic worship that some say is out of touch with modern sensibilities. It is celebrated entirely in Latin, with the priest facing the altar and the faithful receiving communion on the tongue while kneeling. Critics argue that it can feel inaccessible and limits parishioners' participation, while supporters say it is a sacred preservation of tradition.",
      "Merely by convening the consistory, Pope Leo's has underscored his commitment to involving the full College of Cardinals in governance of the Catholic Church, which has some 1.4 billion followers worldwide according to the Vatican.",
      "By contrast, during his 12-year papacy, Pope Francis held only one extraordinary consistory, instead relying primarily on a small group of hand-picked advisors to help him plot the church's course \u2014 a practice that left some cardinals feeling sidelined.",
      "Since his election at the papal conclave in May, the American pontiff's tenure has largely been shaped by commitments inherited from Francis, including the major events of the 2025 Holy Year.",
      "By convening the consistory immediately after those Holy Year events, Leo appears to be signaling the unofficial launch of his own pontificate, and charting a course aligned with his priorities.",
      "Leo signalled on Wednesday that his papacy would be progressive, calling the Second Vatican Council \u2014 a landmark gathering in the 1960s known as Vatican II that was seen as a significant move to modernize the Catholic Church \u2014   the \"guiding star\" of the Church's journey under his leadership.",
      "Among other things, Vatican II allowed for mass to be celebrated in local languages, not just the traditional Latin. It also introduced simpler rites and encouraged more participation by active lay people in congregations, and cemented improved relations between Catholics, Jews and people of other faiths, and promoting the church's engagement with the modern world.",

      "Exiled Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former U.S.-backed shah, has called for Iranians to chant together against the country's leadership at 8 p.m. local time (noon Eastern) on Thursday and Friday. Whether a significant number of people answer his call could determine whether deadly,\u00a012-day-old protests fizzle out as previous rounds of unrest have, or grow into a major challenge to the government, and provoke a possible wider crackdown.",
      "\"My dear compatriots, over the last week I have watched your demonstrations closely, particularly those that are taking place today in the bazaars of Tehran,\" Pahlavi said in a video posted Tuesday on social media.",
      "\"Despite the regime's ongoing violent crackdown, you are resisting, and it is inspiring,\" Pahlavi said. \"You have certainly noticed and seen that larger crowds have repeatedly led regime forces to flee and have even increased defections to the side of the people. Therefore, it is critical to keep these demonstrations disciplined, and as large as possible. This Thursday and Friday, January 8th and 9th, starting precisely at 8 pm, wherever you are, whether in the streets or even from your own homes, I call on you to begin chanting exactly at this time. Based on your response, I will announce the next calls to action.\"",
      "Some analysts and Iranian insiders believe it could be a crucial moment.",
      "\"It seems as though his call for people to come out in masses today and tomorrow could be a turning point,\" Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told CBS News on Thursday. \"This is a regime that is not afraid to use lethal force. But the question is, to what extent, if they become overwhelmed, if the protests become overwhelmingly large and if there are elements in security forces, police, and so forth, kind of at that local level, who themselves are suffering the effects of this economic crisis and who decide not to shoot at people: These are the kinds of questions I think that we need to watch.\"",
      "Another longtime observer of the regime inside the country, referring to Pahlavi's call, said in written comments to CBS News on Thursday that, \"the moment we're all waiting for is 8pm this evening ... If there is widespread participation \u2014 impossible to ignore \u2014   it could be a turning point.\"",
      "\"If the chanting at 8 o'clock is really loud \u2014   ear-deafening, and in chorus, and eye-catching [ie impossible for authorities to ignore], then from Friday on it will be assumed the protests are a real force and they will gain momentum \u2014   and then we are heading for the unknown,\" they said.",

      "Yacoubian said the current protests in Iran were different to the last widescale demonstrations that swept the country, over the 2022 death in police custody of a young woman accused of violating strict rules on attire, because they are focused on economic woes.",
      "\"In 2022, the regime could respond more directly to the demands of the protesters by simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth,\" Yacoubian said. \"There was a lot of violence that was undertaken. Many people were killed. But you actually have seen a very significant relaxing of those kinds of social strictures in Iran.\"",
      "Despite that relaxation of some rules governing people's daily behavior, the intense economic woes in sanctions-wracked Iran was enough to spark the current wave of unrest, which, despite a number of measures aimed at placating demonstrators, has continued to spread around the country.",
      "Yacoubian said the Iranian government did not have any meaningful way to assuage the concerns of the current demonstrators over Iran's economy.",
      "\"In the case of these economically driven protests, there's really nothing (the regime) can do to address the concerns and the kind of the drivers of public disaffection, because it's driven by an economy that has utterly failed and is collapsing,\" Yacoubian said.",
      "Another potential factor is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's potential interest in further targeting Iran's ballistic missile program at a moment of perceived weakness for the regime in Tehran.",
      "\"That's a completely different dynamic that has nothing to do with these protests, but that actually, frankly, even if there had been no protests and you were asking me, I'd say, look, I think it's very possible that we're going to see a second round of conflict between Israel and Iran,\" Yacoubian said.",
      "Iran's leaders, \"certainly have, I'm sure, a very clear understanding of all the pressure points, both domestic and foreign, and it could be that's why they're so off their footing, is they actually are reading, probably well, the situation and don't really seem to have a good plan as to how to manage the unrest.\"",

      "Geneva \u2014 The French owners of the bar in a Swiss ski resort town that went up in flames on New Year's Eve will be questioned Friday, sources close to the investigation said. French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti owned and managed the Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, which was filled with young partygoers when the blaze erupted around 1:30 a.m. on January 1.",
      "Forty people, most of them teenagers, were killed, and 116 were injured.",
      "The pair, who are facing charges of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, will be questioned by the public prosecutor's office in the nearby town of Sion, a source close to the investigation, who asked not to be named, told AFP on Thursday.",
      "This will mark the first time the couple is questioned by investigators since the charges against them were announced on Saturday.",
      "The pair, who have not been detained, said in a statement on Tuesday that they were \"devastated and overwhelmed with grief,\" and pledged their \"full cooperation\" with investigators.",
      "\"We will under no circumstances attempt to evade these matters,\" they said.",
      "A number of questions have been raised about whether fire safety standards were respected in the bar, where prosecutors believe the blaze started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached were raised too close to sound insulation foam on the ceiling in the bar's basement section.",
      "On Tuesday, municipal authorities acknowledged that no fire safety inspections had been conducted at the Le Constellation since 2019.",
      "Questions have also been raised about the couple's background and numerous real estate holdings.",
      "The French newspaper Le Parisien reported earlier this week that Jacques Moretti was known to authorities and served some time in jail about 20 years ago in the south of France on charges related to prostitution and kidnapping.",
      "Sebastien Fanti, a lawyer representing four families of the injured, hailed the news that the Moretti's would be questioned in the case, telling AFP he hoped it signaled, \"a welcome resurgence of the investigation.\"",
      "The questioning will focus on the couple's personal circumstances, according to another source close to the case.",
      "\"Establishing the defendants' personal situation, particularly from an economic standpoint, is essential,\" Romain Jordan, a lawyer representing several families, told AFP.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:53:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

    "story": [
      "Iran's leaders faced another day of intense protests on Wednesday, with the death toll climbing close to 40 according to a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists. As violent demonstrations popped up in more cities and towns across the Islamic Republic, the regime took a familiar stance, leaning into anti-Western rhetoric, ignoring the reports of dozens of civilians being killed, and offering economic aid to residents in a bid to quell the unrest that started as protests over inflation and the cost of living.",
      "As they grapple for ways to end the street protests \u2014 under the threat of U.S. intervention by President Trump \u2014 Iranian authorities said a man was executed by hanging after being convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, according to the country's state-run IRNA news agency.",
      "Ali Ardestani was convicted of providing Israeli intelligence \"with images and photos of specific locations and information on target subjects, and received amounts in the form of digital currency at the end of each mission,\" IRNA said. Iranian authorities hold trials behind closed doors, and no evidence against Ardestani was made public. Iran executed more than 1,000 people last year\u2014 the highest number of executions in the country since 1989, according to Amnesty International.",
      "The latest execution came as Iran's hardline Islamic rulers face the most significant domestic unrest seen in the country in several years. Nationwide protests against the autocratic regime entered their 12th day on Thursday.",
      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), set up by Iranian human rights activists and reliant on a network of contacts still in the country, said Wednesday that at least 38 people had been killed since the protests began, including four security forces.",
      "The protests started as business owners in Tehran vented frustration over spiraling inflation and the cost of basic goods. Iran's economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years, but the demonstrations escalated quickly into the widest protests seen in the country since 2022, following the death of a young woman in police custody after she was detained for an alleged dress code violation.",
      "Trump's warning lingers as Iran tries to quell protests",
      "On Sunday, President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. could hit Iran \"very hard\" if protesters are not protected. \"We're watching it very closely,\" Mr. Trump said. He'd said two days earlier that if Iran \"violently kills protesters,\" the U.S. would \"come to their rescue.\"",
      "So far, there's been no overt sign of the U.S. following through on these threats, even as the reported death toll from the protests climbs, and no further comment from the White House about what actions by the Iranian regime might actually trigger a response.",
      "In an effort to quell the internal pressure, Iran's government announced economic measures over the weekend to help Iranian citizens make ends meet, and state media said Wednesday that President Mahsoud Pezeshkian had ordered security forces not to attack peaceful demonstrators.",

      "A spacewalk planned for Thursday outside the International Space Station was called off late Wednesday because of a \"medical concern\" with an unidentified crew member, NASA said in a statement.",
      "An update shortly before midnight said the agency was exploring \"all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew 11's mission.\"",

      "While NASA did not identify the astronaut in question or explain the medical issue \u2014 standard practice due to privacy concerns \u2014 the agency said \"the matter involved a single crew member who is stable.\"",
      "Space station commander Mike Fincke, flight engineer Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov launched to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship on August. 1.",
      "Going into the new year, the crew expected to remain in space until their replacements arrive in mid-February. Crew 11's return to Earth is expected around Feb. 20. That's still the official plan.",
      "In the meantime, Cardman, 38, and Fincke, 58, a veteran of nine spacewalks on earlier missions, were planning to venture outside the station Thursday to finish building a truss needed to support a set of roll-out solar arrays and to carry out other planned maintenance.",
      "A second spacewalk by two yet-to-be-announced astronauts was planned for next week.",

      "\"The situation is stable. NASA will share additional details, including a new date for the upcoming spacewalk, later.\"",
      "In a brief space-to-ground radio exchange just after 2:30 p.m. EST, Yui called mission control in Houston and asked for a private medical conference, or PMC.",
      "Mission control replied that a PMC, using a private radio channel, would be set up momentarily. Yui then asked if a flight surgeon was available and if flight controllers had a live camera view from inside the station.",
      "\"Houston, do we still have, like, a camera view in Node 2, uh, 3, lab?\" Yui asked.",
      "\"We don't have any internal cameras right now, but we can put the lab view in if you'd like,\" the mission control communicator replied.",
      "\"I appreciate that,\" Yui replied. He then asked: \"Do you have like a crew surgeon? ... A flight surgeon?\"",

      "President Trump spoke on the phone Wednesday with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, after months of tensions between the two leaders boiled over in recent days, with Mr. Trump calling Colombia a \"sick man\" and suggesting military action in the country \"sounds good to me.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said on Truth Social he \"appreciated [Petro's] call and tone,\" adding that the two leaders are planning to meet at the White House at some point. The U.S. president said Petro called \"to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had.\"",
      "Colombia's embassy in the U.S. said in a statement the country \"welcomes the constructive tone of the exchange\" and \"remains committed to open dialogue.\"",
      "A Colombian official familiar with the conversation told CBS News the call was \"very positive,\" describing it as a \"180\u00b0 change\" in both sides' rhetoric.",
      "A high-level Colombian official said in response to the call: \"we did it!\"",
      "Petro said in a post on X that he and Mr. Trump discussed their disagreements over \"his vision of the relationship between the United States and Latin America.\" He said he believes the United States can partner with the region on energy, fueled by billions in U.S. investments, but the U.S. shouldn't use the region exclusively for oil.",
      "Petro included an image of a jaguar and a bald eagle embracing. The Colombian leader has repeatedly warned in recent months that U.S. strikes on Colombia would \"awaken the jaguar.\"",
      "Entre las cosas que hablamos, el presidente Trump y yo, fue el desencuentro que tuvimos en su visi\u00f3n de la relaci\u00f3n de EEUU con Am\u00e9rica Latina.Dije en mi carta escrita a Trump en el inicio de su gobierno, y a Biden personalmente que se pod\u00eda establecer un alianza am\u00e9ricana, si\u2026 pic.twitter.com/z2FSfWafdl",
      "Relations between the U.S. and Colombia have been tense for months, with the Trump administration accusing the Colombian government of failing to contain a spike in cocaine production. In October of last year, Mr. Trump called Petro an \"illegal drug leader,\" and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced sanctions on Petro and his family, claiming he \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Petro, meanwhile, has been a staunch critic of the U.S.'s military buildup near Latin America. He denounced the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug boats in a September speech before the United Nations, and days later, he said during a New York protest rally that members of the U.S. military should \"disobey the orders of Trump.\" The State Department revoked Petro's visa in response, calling his actions \"reckless and incendiary.\"",
      "The tensions have ratcheted up since the U.S. military's overnight capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro over the weekend, which Petro denounced as an act of \"aggression.\"",
      "A day after the operation, Mr. Trump expressed ire toward Petro, telling reporters: \"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long.\"",
      "Asked whether that means there could be some kind of U.S. operation in Colombia, Mr. Trump responded, \"It sounds good to me.\"",
      "Petro \u2014 a former member of a guerrilla group and Colombia's first leftist leader in decades \u2014 responded forcefully early Monday morning. He wrote on X that he \"swore never to touch a weapon again,\" but \"for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers linked to Venezuela \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and one in the Caribbean Sea, officials said.",
      "The U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure\u00a0of the Marinera, a Venezuela-linked oil tanker formerly known as Bella-1. It said the vessel was seized for violations of U.S. sanctions and pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro.",
      "Two Defense Department officials told CBS News Navy SEALs took over the oil tanker. They were flown by service members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the \"Night Stalkers.\"",
      "The U.S. has been following the tanker since last month, and CBS News first reported on Monday that American forces were planning to intercept it. The pursuit began during a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces last weekend. Two other oil tankers were seized by the U.S. last month.",
      "U.S. officials also announced on Wednesday that \"a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker\" was seized before dawn in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X that the intercepted vessel, M/T Sophia, was \"conducting illicit activities\" and operating in international waters.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News the Sophia was flying a Cameroonian flag and left Venezuela with oil on board. The U.S. judged the ship to be in violation of its embargo on Venezuela. The officials said the U.S. has full control of the vessel and no U.S. personnel were injured in the operation. The U.S. Coast Guard was escorting the vessel to the U.S. \"for final disposition,\" according to U.S. Southern Command.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, who posted video of one of the interceptions on social media, described the operations as \"back-to-back\" and \"meticulously coordinated,\" adding that the vessels were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it.",
      "The Marinera, formerly Bella-1",
      "The Marinera \u2014 which has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department \u2014 was sailing under the Russian flag. It was previously flagged out of Panama. Like other tankers that were seized, it was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading.",
      "A Russian submarine and other naval vessels had been deployed to escort the tanker as the U.S. followed it, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Noem said the tanker \"has been trying to evade the Coast Guard for weeks, even changing its flag and painting a new name on the hull while being pursued, in a desperate and failed attempt to escape justice.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the tanker a Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel. \"The vessel was deemed stateless after flying a false flag,\" she said.",
      "Russia responded to the seizure, with its Ministry of Transport saying on the messaging platform Telegram Wednesday that the vessel had been \"granted temporary permission to sail under the State Flag of the Russian Federation, issued in accordance with Russian legislation and the norms of international law,\" \"In accordance with the provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the high seas are governed by the principle of freedom of navigation, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,\" the ministry said.",
      "The ministry said that U.S. naval forces boarded the Marinera at 3 p.m. Moscow time Wednesday and that communication with the ship was later lost.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping\u00a0lists\u00a0the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that the Russian government officially had asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said earlier this week that the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and that the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "Ships like the Marinera and The Skipper are part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",

      "The U.S. military action removing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power divides Americans, and their views on it connect to what they think the U.S. goals are and what they believe comes next.",
      "At the moment, most think the Trump administration is among other aims trying to get access to Venezuela's oil and expand U.S. power in the region \u2014 and when Americans think those are big parts of the goals, they tend to disapprove.",
      "When people think the goals are a lot about stopping drugs, gangs and terrorists, they are more approving.\u00a0 That view is largely voiced by Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who think this action will make the U.S. stronger, and they give the operation overwhelming support.",
      "Either way, that mix of perceptions is partly because most Americans say the administration hasn't clearly explained the U.S.' plans with Venezuela.",
      "Looking ahead, the public expresses uncertainty about what happens now with the U.S. military and Venezuela. Those who think U.S. military involvement will be limited are more approving of the action than those who now foresee a lot of involvement.",
      "And the majority do not want to see the U.S. having a lot of control over Venezuela.",
      "MAGA's views on Venezuela operation",
      "Even more MAGA Republicans support the action now than supported the idea of it back in November.",
      "There are at least two reasons: one is that they overwhelmingly call the operation a military success, whereas other Americans frequently say it's too soon to evaluate.",
      "Another is that they see more impact: MAGA Republicans are especially apt to say this will stop drugs, make the U.S. position in the world stronger, and get other countries in the region to cooperate with the U.S.",
      "Other Americans, by contrast, are more mixed on those implications.",
      "For context, MAGA Republicans also overwhelmingly approved of the U.S. bombing in Iran last summer.",
      "Impact of Maduro's removal from power on U.S. standing",
      "U.S. military and involvement from here",
      "On balance, many more call the specific operation that removed Maduro a success than not, but nearly half feel it is too soon to say. That may depend on what they think happens from here.",
      "Very few want the U.S. to have a lot of control over Venezuela now.",
      "Most do not support further military action if Venezuela does not cooperate with U.S. interests. Nor would they back taking military action in other countries in the region if those countries are not seen as cooperating with the U.S.",
      "But Republicans stand apart here \u2014 particularly most of the MAGA base: Most would support further military actions in either of those cases.",
      "In the region",
      "President Trump",
      "Somewhat more people approve of the military action to remove Maduro than approve of the president's handling of the situation with Venezuela more generally; the latter tracks more closely to his overall approval, and his overall approval hasn't changed since before this action.",
      "While they still don't give it wide approval, some groups do rate Maduro's removal a little more highly compared to how they rate the president's job performance overall. Hispanics are divided about the action to remove Maduro in the same split as Americans overall. Slightly more independents approve of removing Maduro than approve of Trump overall.",
      "Congress' role",
      "Looking at the role of Congress: just as before the action, when most Americans said Mr. Trump needed congressional approval for military action in Venezuela, so today do most Americans think Congress would need to approve any further military action there.",

    "summary": "Denmark and Greenland requested a meeting with Marco Rubio, which one Danish lawmaker hopes will halt talk \"about wanting to acquire Greenland.\"",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would meet with Danish officials next week, after the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark requested to confer \"as soon as possible,\" lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Brask said he was\u00a0\"guessing that it will be a matter of putting facts right, and stop the misinformation and stop talking about wanting to acquire Greenland.\u00a0Greenland is not for sale.\"",
      "The request comes after Rubio told U.S. lawmakers Monday that the Trump administration's goal was to buy the island, not take it by force, according to a lawmaker and a source familiar with his congressional briefing.",
      "The Trump administration has not, however, taken the option of using the U.S. military off the table to meet its stated objective of \"acquiring Greenland,\" as White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put it on Tuesday.",
      "\"You can't buy another country or a population. You can't buy people, of course. And when we see the different images from United States of the president, for example, laughing when he's talking about Greenland \u2026 this is really something that is pissing people off in Greenland, to be honest and to be quite frank,\" Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of Denmark's Parliament, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"If you want to collaborate with us and with the Greenlanders, you need to respect us first and foremost.\"",
      "Chemnitz said the U.S. was using \"completely wrong tactics\" to engage with Greenland and called it \"appalling\" that the White House was \"not ruling out that annexation of our country is on the table.\"",
      "Both politicians emphasized that Greenland has always communicated to the U.S. that it is \"open for business,\" as far as American commercial interests in the region.",
      "\"Business development is something that Greenland is responsible for ourselves, and, therefore, it's something that we could do today if we wanted to,\" Chemnitz told CBS News.",
      "\"You can explore, of course, if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis,\" said Brask. \"There won't be any hold back on that.\"",
      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News that thus far U.S. companies have been dissuaded from investing in Greenland's minerals because of the belief that the costs of mining forays on the vast, largely frozen island would outweigh the potential profits.",
      "\"With few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said.",
      "The U.S. seeking control of Greenland, \"to get the strategic minerals is also a bit strange, given that nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",
      "As for U.S. defense interests in Greenland, which President Trump has always stressed as a primary driver of his desire to control the island, Brask told CBS News there have been few hurdles to deepening such ties in the past, and very few at present.",
      "\"You put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc., just by asking, you can,\" he said, referring to the United States. \"It's not you running the country, but you have the options, the possibility of having troops, material \u2026 equipment in Greenland, you just have to ask.\"",
      "The U.S. has maintained one military base in Greenland, the Pituffik Space Base, which supports important missile warning and defense systems, and is the site of radar and satellite surveillance systems.",
      "\"Throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland, and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold war ended. So in a sense, I think it's just worth keeping that in mind when Donald Trump is out saying Denmark is a bad ally and everything,\" Olesen told CBS News. \"It's tasks that the U.S. used to be happy to handle itself. That's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",

    "summary": "Sen. Rand Paul says he opposes military action in Greenland\u200b as the White House says it is exploring all options  for the territory\u200b, including military action.",
    "story": [
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul said Wednesday he opposes any U.S. military action in Greenland as the White House says it is exploring all options for acquisition of the territory.",
      "\"It won't happen under my watch,\" Paul said on \"CBS Mornings\" about military action in Greenland. \"I will do everything to stop any kind of military takeover of Greenland.\"",
      "The Kentucky senator, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has long opposed offensive U.S. military action overseas. He voted to advance a war powers resolution, which would have limited the president's authority to continue a military campaign in Venezuela, but Senate Republicans blocked the measure. The Trump administration did not seek congressional approval before launching last week's strikes. The Senate is expected to bring up a war powers resolution again this week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of President Trump's interest in Greenland that he and his team are \"discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal.\"",
      "Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. A lawmaker and a source familiar with the discussions said Secretary of State Marco Rubio told members of Congress at briefing Tuesday that Mr. Trump would buy Greenland and not take it by force.",
      "Paul did not raise an objection to purchasing Greenland, noting that the U.S. has acquired territory in the past.",
      "\"Half of the United States came to us through the Louisiana Purchase,\" Paul noted. \"Alaska came to us through a purchase. But you didn't get to those purchases like any deal or diplomacy by insulting your opponent. You get there by actually trying to please and get your opponent to agree to this, because it would have to be done voluntarily.\"",
      "Paul said that this type of action in Greenland would have to be initiated by a vote from its more than 50,000 citizens declaring their independence from Denmark, adding, \"I think the people of Greenland are inclined to do\" this.",
      "That would also have to be followed by \"some sort of offer of something that makes it better to be a part of the United States,\" he continued.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the strikes in Venezuela, Paul suggested it marked the beginning of the \"Don-roe doctrine,\" leading to questions about expansion extending to other territories, including Greenland and Canada.",
      "Paul said that he had \"never thought about\" taking Greenland, but \"now that it's been brought up, if you want to effect that, you don't do it by beating people up the same way, like in regard to Canada.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to Canada the \"51st state\" and imposed punishing tariffs against the U.S.' northern neighbor, raising tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "Paul said he's been consistent about his opposition to military action overseas, and he stressed the importance of maintaining Congress' constitutional authority to declare war.",
      "\"I think that this is an important debate to have,\" Paul said. \"Doesn't mean I have anything against President Trump. It doesn't mean that I don't even dislike the result of (former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s) Maduro gone \u2026 But I do think the constitutional debate is an important one.\"",

    "summary": "At least 36 people have reportedly been killed in Iran amid anti-government protests across the nation, putting its rulers under pressure as Trump threatens to intervene.",
    "story": [
      "At least 36 people have been killed amid major anti-government demonstrations across Iran, a U.S.-based rights group says. The Iranian government is trying to quell the unrest, and reacted angrily to President Trump's veiled threat of a U.S. armed intervention.",
      "The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which gave the death toll based on its network of contacts in the country, said in its daily report on Tuesday that at least 36 people \"have been confirmed killed during the past ten days of protests. Among them were four individuals under the age of 18, as well as two members of security and law enforcement forces.\"",
      "HRANA said more than 2,000 protesters had been arrested, \"however, the actual number of detainees is estimated to be significantly higher.\"",
      "The organization shared video on Tuesday that it said showed clashes between protesters and security forces at Tehran's Grand Bazaar \u2014 a center of commerce in the capital where shop owners have long backed the regime.",
      "The protests began more than a week ago in Tehran as business owners took to the streets to vent their frustration over soaring inflation in the nation, whose economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years. But the anger spread quickly to more than 250 locations in at least 27 of Iran's 31 provinces, according to the Washington-based HRANA, with social media videos showing violent clashes between protesters chanting anti-government slogans and security forces every night since.",
      "People who spoke with CBS News from inside the country on Tuesday said the latest demonstrations in the capital were relatively small, corroborating other reports that efforts by the Iranian authorities to placate the protesters have likely had some effect in reducing numbers in recent days.",
      "President Trump said Friday \u2014 a day before American forces attacked Venezuela and captured the country's longtime leader Nicolas Maduro \u2014 that the U.S. was \"locked and loaded and ready,\" warning that if Iran \"violently kills protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't offered any further detail on his threat, but he's been ratcheting up pressure on Tehran since taking office for his second term, including with unprecedented U.S. strikes on the country's nuclear facilities in June as Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war.",
      "\"I think many Iranian people will be inspired by that,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent Iranian news website IranWire, told CBS News on Saturday, referring to Mr. Trump's remarks. \"The message has made the Iranian regime more careful about its actions and using violence against people.\"",
      "Iranian officials have not confirmed the deaths of any protesters, and while acknowledging the demonstrations and economic pain felt in the country, they make little mention of the violence seen on the streets and accuse the U.S. and Israel of fomenting the unrest. The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency claimed Monday that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "The U.S. State Department has issued statements condemning specific incidents in Iran since Mr. Trump leveled his ambiguous threat, but the chances of an American intervention remained unclear on Tuesday.",
      "As has long been the case with Iran, the uncertainty left space for rumors to swirl. There were unconfirmed reports that the country's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was considering escaping into exile in Russia if the protests escalated out of control.",
      "Other reports have speculated that the government could even launch a new attack on Israel \u2014 something the regime has said it is ready for since the 12-day war in June \u2014 in a bid to divert attention away from domestic problems and refocus the population's anger at Iran's biggest foreign adversary, which would likely respond quickly and harshly.",
      "But Iran's intelligence services have a history of leaking false information to the media, especially foreign outlets, to create an exaggerated narrative that the country's leaders can then deny and portray as deliberate Western disinformation.",
      "In the meantime, the government has tried to quash the unrest on the streets not only with security forces, but with a series of measures aimed at showing sympathy with the protesters, including freezing some commodity prices and taxes on businesses, and even a dramatic move Monday to announce cash subsidies for essential goods for all households.",
      "The government does appear to have been bracing for unrest in the wake of the summer war with Israel, which constrained its sanctions-squeezed budgets even further and forced slashes to subsidies and social services.",
      "So far, however, even if the protests haven't continued escalating \u2014   which is difficult to gauge as Iran's government tightly controls the flow of information inside the country \u2014   the efforts to quell the unrest haven't fully succeeded.",
      "In the meantime, the demonstrations continue, as people wait for any further signals from Mr. Trump that he might be willing to try to take advantage of a vulnerable moment for the Islamic Republic's rulers.",

    "summary": "Former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's closest confidants remain in Venezuela, including some wanted by the U.S. who could still be targeted.",
    "story": [
      "As former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife face drug trafficking and other federal charges in the U.S., virtually all of the ousted leader's inner circle \u2014 including some with whom he's accused of running a cartel that allegedly smuggled tons of cocaine into the U.S. \u2014 remain in their posts.",
      "A source briefed on the Trump administration's planning has told U.S. lawmakers that at least some members of that inner circle who, like Maduro, have been charged with crimes in the U.S., could be targets for further American military and law enforcement action.",
      "Secretary of State\u00a0Marco Rubio\u00a0said on CBS' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that an operation to capture at least four of Venezuela's top officials in separate locations was deemed too complicated ahead of the U.S. strikes on the country, leading to the operation focused solely on Maduro as the top target, along with his wife.",
      "Below is a look at some of the senior members of the Maduro regime who remain in Caracas, in some cases with U.S. bounties on their heads.",
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez",
      "The most senior member of Maduro's inner circle untouched by the U.S. attacks and raid over the weekend is the country's former Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who was sworn in soon after the American raid as the new interim president, taking the reins from her longtime political mentor.",
      "The 56-year-old has long been seen as a loyal confidant and protege of the now-deposed Venezuelan leader, and a member of a cadre accused by Washington for many years of helping Maduro maintain his authoritarian grip on power.",
      "It remains unclear if Rodr\u00edguez and the Trump administration might find a way to work together, and thus whether she might remain in power to some degree following Mr. Trump's assertion that the United States will \"run\" Venezuela for some unspecified period.",
      "Mr. Trump warned after Maduro's capture that if Rodr\u00edguez \"doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"",
      "Diosdado Cabello",
      "Another stalwart of the Maduro regime is Diosdado Cabello, who currently serves as Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, giving him oversight of the country's police and prisons.",
      "Cabello previously served as vice president, and for many years as president of the country's parliament. He also spent years in command of Venezuelan intelligence services.",
      "Like Maduro, he has been indicted on criminal charges in the United States, accused of helping to traffic more than 5 tons of cocaine to the U.S.",
      "He was first charged in 2020 with various federal drugs and weapons offenses in an indictment filed in the same Southern District of New York where Maduro was arraigned. The indictment named Cabello as a senior figure in the Cartel del los Soles, which Maduro is accused of leading.",
      "He was hit with further charges in a superceding indictment filed as the U.S. launched the attack on Venezuela. He's been described as the \"chief thug\" in terms of running Venezuela's domestic security forces, who helped keep Maduro in power, and the indictment lays out his alleged ties to drug cartels.",
      "Cabello could be among the targets of further U.S. military and law enforcement action, the source told CBS News' Brennan on Wednesday.",
      "There is a U.S. government reward of $25 million on offer for information leading to Cabello's capture.",
      "Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez",
      "Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, currently serving as Venezuela's Minister of Defense, is also accused of direct involvement in trafficking drugs into the U.S.",
      "The U.S. accuses him of allowing the safe passage of commercial flights carrying illegal drugs, and of collecting a protection fee for doing so, and he was indicted in a federal court in Washington D.C. in 2020.",
      "Padrino, who has longstanding ties with Russia, also has a U.S. bounty on his head, with a $15 million reward on offer.",
      "Jorge Rodr\u00edguez",
      "The new interim president's brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, has served as President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, the country's Maduro-controlled legislature, since 2021. He's also considered a key figure in the regime.",
      "\"My main function in the days to come... as president of this National Assembly, will be to resort to all procedures, all platforms, and all avenues to bring back Nicolas Maduro Moros, my brother, my president,\" Jorge Rodriguez told lawmakers.",
      "Just like his sister, Rodr\u00edguez has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury over his alleged role in undermining democracy in Venezuela and propping up Maduro's authoritarian regime.",
      "Nicol\u00e1s \"Nicolasito\" Ernesto Maduro Guerra",
      "One of Maduro's sons, along with his mother Cilia, who was arraigned with her husband in New York on Monday, was also charged in 2020 with drug offenses relating to the Cartel de los Soles.",
      "Nicol\u00e1s Ernesto Maduro Guerra, 35, known in the country as Nicolasito, or Little Nicol\u00e1s, is currently the deputy president of the legislature. He is also sometimes referred to as \"The Prince\" in the country.",
      "According to the U.S. indictment, the younger Maduro partnered with his father, other senior officials and \"narcotics traffickers and narco-terrorist groups, who dispatched processed cocaine from Venezuela to the United States via transshipment points in the Caribbean and Central America.\"",

    "summary": "The funeral for Brigitte Bardot was private, but hundreds poured into the streets of Saint-Tropez to pay their respects to an icon of the 1960s silver screen.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 Brigitte Bardot's funeral was being held on Wednesday with a private service and a public homage in Saint-Tropez, the French Riviera resort where she lived for more than half a century after retiring from movie stardom at the height of her fame.",
      "The animal rights activist and far-right supporter died on Dec. 28 at the age of 91 at her home in southern France.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron said after her death that France was \"mourning a legend.\"",
      "She died from cancer after undergoing two operations, her husband, Bernard d'Ormale, said in an interview with Paris Match magazine released Tuesday evening. \"She was conscious and concerned about the fate of animals until the very end,\" he said.",
      "Residents and admirers applauded the funeral convoy as the coffin of Bardot, once one of the world's most photographed women and a defining screen siren of the 1960s, was being carried through the town's narrow streets.",
      "A service started to the sound of Maria Callas' \"Ave Maria\" at the Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption Catholic Church in the presence of Bardot's husband, son and grandchildren, as well as guests invited by the family and the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals.",
      "Hundreds of people gathered in the small town to follow the farewell on large screens set up at the port and on two plazas.",
      "After the church service, Bardot is to be buried \"in the strictest privacy\" at a cemetery overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, according to the Saint-Tropez town hall.",
      "She had long called Saint-Tropez her refuge from the celebrity that once made her a household name.",
      "A public homage will take place at a nearby site for admirers of the woman whose image once symbolized France's postwar liberation and sensuality.",
      "\"Brigitte Bardot will forever be associated with Saint-Tropez, of which she was the most dazzling ambassador,\" the town hall said last week. \"Through her presence, personality and aura, she marked the history of our town.\"",
      "Bardot settled decades ago in her seaside villa, La Madrague, and retired from filmmaking in 1973 at age 39, during an international career that spanned more than two dozen films.",
      "She later emerged as an animal rights activist, founding and sustaining a foundation devoted to the protection of animals.",
      "\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots' respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation's highest recognition.",
      "While she withdrew from the film industry, she remained a highly visible and often controversial public figure through decades of militant animal rights activism and links with far-right politics.",
      "She will be buried in the so-called marine cemetery, where her parents are also interred.",
      "The cemetery, overlooking the Mediterranean sea, is also the final resting place of several cultural figures, including filmmaker Roger Vadim, Bardot's first husband, who directed her breakout film \"And God Created Woman,\" a role that made her a worldwide star.",

    "summary": "After the U.S. deposed Maduro, Trump and top officials did not rule out efforts at overthrow or annexation in other countries. Here's what they've said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump isn't denying the possibility of further American expansion, intervention or annexation efforts in the Western Hemisphere after the military's success in plucking former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from Caracas over the weekend to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S.",
      "In the past, he's threatened to annex Greenland and Canada and predicted the governments in Cuba and Colombia would fall. Now, Mr. Trump is making similar comments again and raising new questions about what he plans to do next.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that under his administration, \"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again\" \u2014 dubbing his approach the \"Don-roe Doctrine,\" a spin on the 19th century foreign policy concept.",
      "It's not clear whether the president will act on his threats against other countries.",
      "Here's the latest on countries and territories that have been the subject of interventionist comments by the president:",
      "Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump has long coveted Greenland and has said it's necessary for U.S. national security, a point he made again Sunday.",
      "\"We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" he said. \"We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security.\"",
      "\"Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"To boost up security in Greenland, they added one more dogsled.\"",
      "Administration officials are discussing a \"range of options\" to acquire Greenland, including using military force, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.",
      "The president also named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as special envoy to Greenland last month to represent U.S. interests on the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Landry said in a social media post addressed to Mr. Trump, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"",
      "In March, Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland and told a reporter while he was there that \"what we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself.",
      "A post on Saturday by Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, showed Greenland covered in an American flag accompanied by the comment \"Soon,\" which prompted some to wonder if its annexation is on the horizon.",
      "Asked by CNN on Monday if he could rule out that the U.S. is going to try to take Greenland by force, Stephen Miller said, \"There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking \u2014 of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One over the weekend that while nothing is imminent, \"we'll worry about Greenland in about two months. Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen chided Mr. Trump in a social media post, calling suggestions of annexation \"fantasies\" and writing: \"That's enough now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, the leaders of Europe issued a statement saying \"security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.\"",
      "Iran",
      "Escalating protests over the desperate economic conditions in Iran have been taking place for over a week, and there have been reports that dozens of people have been killed. In response, hours before the Venezuela operation began, Mr. Trump posted on social media that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\" He said the U.S. is \"locked and loaded.\"",
      "The president said Sunday of the demonstrations in Iran, \"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.\"",
      "In June, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Iran's major nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, in an effort to destroy its nuclear enrichment capacity.",
      "Cuba",
      "On the way back to Washington Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"Cuba looks like it's ready to fall,\" adding that he didn't know \"if they're going to hold out.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks Saturday indicated Cuba's leaders should be worried: \"If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit.\" A day later, on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" he said of Cuba, \"they're in a lot of trouble.\"",
      "Though he didn't detail any plans for Cuba or its leaders, Rubio said, \"I don't think it's any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro.\"",
      "Rubio highlighted the close ties between Venezuela and Cuba, noting that Maduro had relied on Cuban bodyguards for protection and said they were in charge of the Venezuelan government's \"internal intelligence.\" The Cuban government said 32 Cubans were killed during the military operation to capture Maduro.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump seems content to see how things play out on the island.",
      "\"I don't think we need any action\" in Cuba, he said, pointing out that Cuba \"now has no income \u2014 they got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They're not getting any of it. And Cuba literally is ready to fall.\"",
      "In the past year, Cuba's oil imports from Venezuela fell by 15%, to 27,400 barrels per day, according to Reuters, which also said that Cuba's supply from Mexico over the same period, from January to October, had dropped by 73%, to just 5,000 bpd.",
      "Colombia",
      "The president appears to have less patience for Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he has accused of illegal drug production and trafficking.",
      "\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday. Asked whether he was threatening to undertake a military operation in Colombia, the president replied, \"It sounds good to me. You know what \u2026 they kill a lot of people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has claimed that cocaine production has spiked during Petro's presidency, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced sanctions on Petro in October because he \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Petro has accused the U.S. of violating international law with its attacks on alleged drug boats, which have now killed at least 115 people, and he suggested that some innocent civilians may have been killed in the strikes. The U.S. denies that any innocent civilians have been killed in any of the boat strikes.",
      "Petro \u2014 who once belonged to a guerilla group \u2014 warned Mr. Trump against taking action in his country, writing on X that he \"swore never to touch a weapon again,\" but \"for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want.\"",
      "Canada",
      "While Mr. Trump has in the past talked about making Canada the \"51st state,\" he has not brought it up again since the Venezuela operation.",
      "But Mr. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs against Canada, raising the tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "In October, Mr. Trump threatened to end trade negotiations with Canada after an anti-tariff ad using Ronald Reagan's voice ran in Ontario. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pulled the ad, saying \"our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"",
      "Panama Canal",
      "Mr. Trump argued earlier in his term that the U.S. should regain control over the strategic Panama Canal \u2014 drawing flak from Panama's government. The U.S. oversaw the canal's construction in the early 20th century and controlled it for decades, but began handing the canal and surrounding land back over to Panama in 1979.",
      "He claimed in March that he was \"reclaiming the Panama Canal,\" referring to a deal by a U.S.-led consortium to buy a controlling stake in the company that operates ports near the canal. Panama's president accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "What is the Monroe Doctrine?",
      "In 1823, America's fifth president, James Monroe, outlined before Congress the U.S.' policy toward its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. It was initially intended to ward off European colonialism, but the Monroe administration also wanted to increase the U.S.' influence and trading alliances.",
      "During the Cold War, the U.S. cited the Monroe Doctrine to be used as a defense against the expansion of communism in Latin America.",
      "The phrase \"Don-roe Doctrine\" first appeared on the cover of the New York Post last year.",

    "story": [
      "European leaders released a joint statement Tuesday, outlining the importance of Arctic security, but stressing that \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" hours after White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said it was \"the formal position of the U.S. government... that Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Miller also said, in an interview Monday with CNN, that \"the United States is the power of NATO. For the United States to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend NATO and NATO interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Greenland has been a semi-autonomous  territory of Denmark, and has been tied to the small European nation for 300 years, though it has its own elected government. The largest island in the world, it is located to the northeast of Canada and is about the size of  Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to  only around 60,000 people.",
      "Its  location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both  economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "\"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up. We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries,\" the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the U.K. and Greenland said in their joint statement on Tuesday.",
      "\"Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them. The United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally and through the defense agreement between the Kingdom of Denmark and the United States of 1951,\" the U.S. allies said.",
      "\"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",
      "On Monday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance.",
      "\"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\" Frederiksen told local media on Monday. \"That is, including our NATO, and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\"",
      "When asked Tuesday if the U.S. would use military force to take over Greenland, Miller told CNN: \"The United States should have Greenland as part of the United States. There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking, of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers pushed back against the idea of asserting U.S. control over Greenland.",
      "Democratic Rep. Steny H. Hoyer and Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who co-chair the bipartisan Congressional Friends of Denmark Caucus, said in a joint statement that \"sabre-rattling about annexing Greenland is needlessly dangerous.\"",
      "They said any U.S. attack on Greenland \"would tragically be an attack on NATO.\"",
      "\"We already have access to everything we could need from Greenland,\" the two lawmakers said, noting that Denmark's government has already given the U.S. permission to deploy additional military forces there, or to build more missile defense infrastructure on the island.",

      "Huynh is a startup founder and investor as well as a former fundraiser for former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.",
      "According to Huynh, the two tax proposals, an annual wealth tax proposal and a 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, would cause a \"mass migration,\" starting with \"not just the billionaires, but the people who are investing in new ideas, in new infrastructure, whether it's AI, healthcare, tech, robotics.\"",

      "Public filings reviewed by Fox News Digital from the California Secretary of State\u2019s office show several business entities linked to the Google co-founder were moved out of the state in December, ahead of the Jan. 1, 2026 residency date tied to the proposed tax. Those filings indicate his family office, Koop LLC, and his influenza research fund, Flu Lab LLC, no longer list California, while a flying-car venture, One Aero, now lists its primary address in Florida.",
      "Meanwhile, Ellison has taken steps that signal a potential pullback from California, though details of a reported $45 million off-market sale of his San Francisco home have not been independently confirmed by major outlets. The New York Post reported the sale and said it would mark the city\u2019s largest real estate transaction of 2025.",
      "With these exits in mind, Hyunh likened the proposed tax hikes to a restaurant about to go out of business.",
      "\"Instead of lowering the price, they increase the price,\" she said. \"And then you go into the restaurant, and it's like $50 for a bowl of really bad dumplings.\"",
      "According to Huynh, the annual wealth tax would impose a one to 1.5 percent tax on anything over $50 million.",
      "\"And that's paper valuation,\" she explained. \"So, for example, if you have $1 million in liquid assets, that's cash, and $49 million, say, in artwork or in a house that you inherited from your family, you would be responsible for the entire 50 million in terms of your cost basis for that 1 percent.\"",
      "The second proposal, the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, would impose a one-time five percent tax on any asset valued above $1 billion, including a business holding.",
      "\"You could be a founder, you could be a tech star, and you could be worth a hundred billion dollars. But say you only have like $2 million in liquid assets because all that money is used to run your new AI company. Well, doesn't matter; you're going to be taxed entirely on that $100 billion. And so, effectively, you owe the state of California one time, $5 billion.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court is slated to rule soon on President Donald Trump&apos;s sweeping tariff plan, which the president characterized as &quot;life or death.&quot;",
    "story": [
      "Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo joins 'The Sunday Briefing' to weigh in on the Supreme Court\u2019s skepticism over President Donald Trump\u2019s power to impose international tariffs.",
      "The Supreme Court could rule as early as Friday on President Donald Trump\u2019s use of an emergency law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on most U.S. trading partners, a closely watched case with major implications for businesses and the president himself.",
      "At issue is the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose two sweeping sets of tariffs, including the 10% global tariffs and the higher, so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs in early April.",
      "Lower courts had ruled that Trump exceeded his authority in using IEEPA as a means of quickly enacting those import fees, prompting the Supreme Court to take up the case on an expedited basis last year. A decision is expected by June at the latest.",
      "US COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE SIDES WITH TRUMP IN TARIFF CASE",
      "But justices on the high court, including Trump's own appointees, appeared skeptical of the administration's claim during oral arguments that the IEEPA gives a sitting president the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, leaving open the question of what might happen if the high court rules against the president.",
      "Trump, for his part, has described the matter as \"life and death,\" and senior administration officials have warned for months of dire economic consequences if the high court were to undo the tariffs enacted by Trump, which have remained in place as the courts considered the case on its merits.",
      "But the short answer, experts told Fox News Digital, is that not much would change immediately, and it would almost certainly involve more litigation.",
      "A Fox News graphic depicts how countries have responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs. (Fox News; Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "In the months since the high court reviewed the consolidated case, Learning Resources, Inc, and V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, hundreds of businesses have filed new cases against the Trump administration over IEEPA, aimed at clawing back the higher import duties they've shouldered since his tariffs took force.",
      "The U.S. collected more than $133 billion in IEEPA tariff duties as of mid-December, according to data published by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency last month.",
      "And, assuming the Supreme Court does not specifically outline a remedy portion of its ruling for the executive branch to follow, the cases will be punted back to the lower courts to chart a path forward, lawyers for the new plaintiffs said.",
      "\"There's a group of us working with the Department of Justice on getting a case management plan implemented,\" Erik Smithweiss, a trade lawyer representing some of the companies that have filed the new tariff lawsuits, told Fox News Digital in an interview.",

      "\"In the event the tariffs are found to be unlawful, the Court of International Trade (CIT) is going to manage these thousands of lawsuits and many more that may be coming.\"",
      "Trump, for his part, has railed against that outcome, which he described in a Truth Social post as a \"National Security catastrophe.\"",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration argued in court that the IEEPA law in question allows a president to act in response to \"unusual and extraordinary threats\" and in cases where a national emergency has been declared. Trump has claimed that deep and \"sustained\" trade deficits amount to a national emergency, allowing him, in the lawyers' view, to invoke IEEPA.",
      "Plaintiffs counter that, in the 50 years since its passage, the law has never been used by a president to impose tariffs. They argue that permitting Trump to use the law to enact tariffs would drastically expand his powers at the expense of other branches of government.",
      "Others were more cautious about the possible impact.",

      "\"It's a fascinating situation because it's super important. But, in the short run, economically, this doesn't matter a huge deal,\" Philip Luck, the director of the economics program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told Fox News Digital in an interview.",
      "\"It matters in the sense that, yes, if this comes down, some goods will become cheaper,\" Luck said when asked what would happen if the Supreme Court ruled against Trump's use of IEEPA to impose his tariffs. \"Some exporters will be able to export to the United States more cheaply.\"",
      "On its own, though, the ruling is unlikely to stop the Trump administration from imposing the tariffs via other mechanisms at its disposal, including Section 232, by which the administration can enact industry-wide tariffs for a set period of time, or under Section 301, which allows the U.S. Trade Representative's office to enact tariffs at a president's direction in response to countries that are determined to have \"discriminatory\" trade practices towards U.S. businesses.",

      "The attack did not stop at the email. Once a victim clicked the link, they were sent to a page hosted on storage.cloud.google.com. That added another layer of trust. From there, the link redirected again to googleusercontent.com. Next came a fake CAPTCHA or image check. This step blocked automated security scanners while letting real users continue. After passing that screen, victims landed on a fake Microsoft login page hosted on a non-Microsoft domain. Any credentials entered there were captured by the attackers.",
      "Who was targeted in the Google Cloud phishing attack",
      "Check Point says the campaign focused heavily on industries that rely on automated alerts and shared documents. That included manufacturing, technology, finance, professional services, and retail. Other sectors like healthcare, education, government, energy, travel and media were also targeted. These environments see constant permission requests and file-sharing notices, which made the lures feel routine.",
      "\"We have blocked several phishing campaigns involving the misuse of an email notification feature within Google Cloud Application Integration,\" a Google spokesperson told Cyberguy. \"Importantly, this activity stemmed from the abuse of a workflow automation tool, not a compromise of Google\u2019s infrastructure. While we have implemented protections to defend users against this specific attack, we encourage continued caution as malicious actors frequently attempt to spoof trusted brands. We are taking additional steps to prevent further misuse.\"",
      "The incident demonstrates how attackers can weaponize legitimate cloud automation tools without resorting to traditional spoofing.",
      "Ways to stay safe from trusted-looking phishing emails",
      "Phishing emails are getting harder to spot, especially when attackers abuse real cloud platforms like Google Cloud. These steps help reduce risk when emails look familiar and legitimate.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency. Messages about voicemails, shared files or permission changes are designed to make you click fast. Pause before taking action. Ask yourself whether you were actually expecting that alert. If not, verify it another way.",
      "Always hover over links to preview the destination domain. In this campaign, links jumped across multiple trusted-looking Google domains before landing on a fake login page. If the final destination does not match the service asking you to sign in, close the page immediately.",
      "Shared document alerts are a favorite lure because they feel routine at work. If an email claims you were granted access to a file you do not recognize, do not click directly from the message. Instead, open your browser and sign in to Google Drive or OneDrive manually to check for new files.",
      "The final step led users to a fake Microsoft login page, where entered credentials were silently stolen. (Stack Social)",
      "Password managers can be a strong last line of defense. They will not autofill credentials on fake Microsoft or Google login pages hosted on non-official domains. If your password manager refuses to fill in a login, that is a red flag worth paying attention to.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Each year, billions of single-use plastic bottles end up in landfills or oceans. That waste problem keeps growing. Now, a new scientific breakthrough suggests those same bottles could help power your daily life.",
      "Researchers have developed a way to transform discarded plastic water bottles into high-performance energy storage devices called supercapacitors. The work focuses on PET plastic, short for polyethylene terephthalate, which is used in most beverage bottles.",
      "The research was published in Energy & Fuels and highlighted by the American Chemical Society. Scientists say the discovery could reduce plastic pollution while helping drive cleaner energy technology.",

      "SCIENTISTS EXTRACT SILVER FROM E-WASTE USING COOKING OIL",
      "Discarded PET water bottles are one of the most common sources of plastic waste worldwide, with hundreds of billions produced each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why PET plastic waste is such a growing problem",
      "PET plastic is everywhere. According to the researchers, more than 500 billion single-use PET plastic bottles are produced every year. Most are used once and thrown away. Lead researcher Dr. Yun Hang Hu says that scale creates a major environmental challenge.",
      "Instead of letting that plastic pile up, the team focused on upcycling it into something valuable. Their idea was simple but powerful. Turn waste into materials that support renewable energy systems and reduce production costs at the same time.",
      "NEW TECH RECOVERS 92% OF EV BATTERY METALS",
      "Those upcycled materials come together to form an all-waste-plastic supercapacitor designed for fast charging and long term energy storage. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How plastic bottles can store and release energy",
      "Imagine a device that can charge fast and deliver power instantly. That is exactly what supercapacitors do. They store and release energy much faster than traditional batteries, which makes them useful for electric vehicles, solar power systems and everyday electronics.",
      "Hu's team found a way to build these energy storage components using discarded PET plastic water bottles. By reshaping the plastic at extremely high temperatures, the researchers turned waste into materials that can generate electricity efficiently and repeatedly.",
      "Here is how the process works:",
      "For the electrodes, researchers cut PET bottles into tiny, grain-sized pieces. They mixed the plastic with calcium hydroxide and heated it to nearly 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in a vacuum. That heat transformed the plastic into a porous, electrically conductive carbon powder.",
      "The powder was then formed into thin electrode layers. For the separator, small pieces of PET were flattened and carefully perforated with hot needles. This pattern allowed electric current to pass efficiently while maintaining safety and durability. Once assembled, the device used two carbon electrodes separated by the PET film and submerged in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.",
      "CIGARETTE BUTTS MAKE ROADS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE",
      "Researchers use extreme heat to convert waste PET plastic into porous carbon materials that can store and move electricity efficiently. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the results surprised scientists",
      "When tested, the all-waste-plastic supercapacitor outperformed similar devices made with traditional glass fiber separators. After repeated charging and discharging, it retained 79 percent of its energy capacity. A comparable glass fiber device retained 78 percent. That difference matters. The PET-based design costs less to produce, remains fully recyclable, and supports circular energy storage technologies where waste materials are reused instead of discarded.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could affect everyday life sooner than you might expect. Cheaper supercapacitors can lower the cost of electric vehicles, solar systems and portable electronics. Faster charging and longer device lifespans could follow. It also shows that sustainability does not require giving something up. Waste plastics could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Although this technology is still in development, the research team believes PET-based supercapacitors could reach commercial markets within 5 to 10 years. In the meantime, choosing reusable bottles and plastic-free alternatives still helps reduce waste today.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Turning trash into energy storage is more than a clever idea. It shows how science can tackle two global challenges at once. Plastic pollution continues to grow. Energy demand does too. This research proves that those problems do not have to be solved separately. By rethinking waste as a resource, scientists are building a cleaner and more efficient future from materials we already throw away.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "A dangerous cybercrime tool has surfaced in underground forums, making it far easier for attackers to spread malware.",
      "Instead of relying on hidden downloads, this tool pushes fake error messages that pressure you into fixing problems that never existed. Security researchers say this method is spreading quickly because it feels legitimate. The page looks broken. The warning feels urgent. The fix sounds simple.",
      "That combination is proving alarmingly effective for cybercriminals.",

      "How fake error malware attacks actually work",
      "These attacks begin with a compromised website. When a visitor lands on the page, something looks wrong right away. Text appears broken. Fonts look scrambled. Visual elements seem corrupted. A pop-up then appears claiming the issue can be fixed with a browser update or a missing system font. A button offers to repair the problem instantly.",
      "Clicking that button copies a command to the clipboard and displays instructions to paste it into PowerShell or a system terminal. That single step launches the infection.",

      "Fake error popups make a website look broken by scrambling text or fonts to create urgency and panic. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Why this new tool changes the threat landscape",
      "The tool behind these attacks is called ErrTraffic. It automates the entire process and removes the technical barriers that once limited cybercrime operations. For about $800, attackers get a full package with a control panel and scripted payload delivery. Analysts at the Hudson Rock Threat Intelligence Team identified the tool after tracking its promotion on Russian-language forums in early December 2025.",
      "ErrTraffic works through a simple JavaScript injection. A single line of code connects a hacked site to the attacker's dashboard. From there, everything adapts automatically. The script detects the operating system and browser. It then displays a customized fake error message in the correct language. The attack works across Windows, Android, macOS and Linux.",
      "MOST PARKED DOMAINS NOW PUSH SCAMS AND MALWARE",
      "The popups often claim a browser update or missing system font is needed to fix the problem. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why security software struggles to stop it",
      "Traditional malware defenses look for suspicious downloads or unauthorized installations. ErrTraffic avoids both. Browsers see normal text copying. Security tools see a legitimate system utility being opened manually. Nothing appears out of place. That design allows the attack to slip through protections that would normally stop malware in its tracks.",
      "The success rate is deeply concerning",
      "Data pulled from active ErrTraffic campaigns shows conversion rates approaching 60%. That means more than half of the visitors who see the fake error message follow the instructions and install malware. Once active, the tool can deliver infostealers like Lumma or Vidar on Windows devices. Android targets often receive banking trojans instead. The control panel even includes geographic filtering, with built-in blocks for Russia and neighboring regions to avoid drawing attention from local authorities.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "Once malware is installed, credentials and session data are stolen. Those compromised logins are then used to breach additional websites. Each newly hacked site becomes another delivery vehicle for the same attack. That cycle allows the campaign to grow without direct involvement from the original operator.",
      "FAKE WINDOWS UPDATE PUSHES MALWARE IN NEW CLICKFIX ATTACK",
      "Following the on-screen instructions can quietly trigger malware that steals passwords and personal data. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Ways to stay safe from fake error malware",
      "A few smart habits can significantly reduce risk when facing fake error pop-ups and browser-based traps.",
      "Legitimate websites never ask you to copy and paste commands into PowerShell or a system terminal. Fake error malware relies on convincing messages that pressure you into doing exactly that. If a page instructs you to run code to fix a problem, close it immediately.",
      "Fake error campaigns often use broken text, scrambled fonts or warnings about missing files to grab attention. As a result, these visuals create urgency and trigger fear. In reality, a real system problem never announces itself through a random website, so close the page right away.",
      "Real browser and operating system updates come from built-in update tools, not pop-ups on websites. If an update is needed, your device will notify you directly through system settings or trusted app stores.",
      "Strong antivirus software can help block malicious scripts, detect infostealers and stop suspicious behavior before damage spreads. This is especially important since fake error malware targets Windows, Android, macOS and Linux systems.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "If a real update is needed, the operating system will request it directly. A random webpage never should.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake error malware works because it plays on a very human reaction. When something on a screen suddenly looks broken, most people want to fix it fast and move on. That split-second decision is exactly what attackers are counting on. Tools like ErrTraffic show how polished these scams have become. The messages look professional. The instructions feel routine. Nothing about the moment screams danger. But behind the scenes, one click can quietly hand over passwords, banking access and personal data. The good news is that slowing down makes a real difference. Closing a suspicious page and trusting built-in system updates can stop these attacks cold. When it comes to pop-ups claiming your device is broken, walking away is often the smartest fix.",

By pivoting from domains linked to ShadyPanda, Koi researchers uncovered shared systems powering multiple extension clusters. That analysis confirmed that ShadyPanda, GhostPoster and Zoom Stealer were not separate actors. They were one coordinated operation. Together, these campaigns targeted both everyday users and corporate environments.",

      "Instead of pushing new extension versions, DarkSpectre controlled everything from its servers. Operators could change behavior anytime without alerting users or marketplaces. Koi researchers noted this approach gave the attackers long-term flexibility and control.",
      "Why the Zoom Stealer campaign stands out",
      "Most malware focuses on consumer fraud. Zoom Stealer focused on intelligence.",
      "According to Koi analysts, these extensions collected the following:",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwordsMeeting IDs, topics and schedulesSpeaker names, titles, bios and photosCompany affiliations and branding",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwords",
      "Meeting IDs, topics and schedules",
      "Speaker names, titles, bios and photos",
      "Company affiliations and branding",
      "Worse yet, the data streamed in real time. The moment a user joined or viewed a meeting, the information flowed out. This type of data enables phishing impersonation and corporate espionage at scale.",
      "Why browser extensions remain a weak link",
      "Extension marketplaces typically evaluate code only at submission or update. Koi's investigation shows how attackers exploit that model. Once an extension earns trust badges and positive reviews, users stop questioning it. That trust becomes a weapon. A clean extension today can become a threat tomorrow.",
      "Ways to stay safe from malicious browser extensions",
      "You do not need to avoid extensions entirely. You do need to stay cautious.",
      "Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it.",
      "Remove anything you no longer use. Fewer extensions reduce risk. CyberGuy has step-by-step guides showing how to review and remove browser extensions safely, making it easy to clean up your browser in just a few minutes. In Chrome, Edge and Firefox, open the\u00a0menu, go to\u00a0Extensions or Add-ons, and\u00a0remove anything you do not use or trust.",
      "Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "A long-running malware operation quietly abused trusted browser extensions across Chrome, Edge and Firefox, infecting millions worldwide. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Strong antivirus software can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. A data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.",
      "It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag. Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension\u2019s been sold or hacked.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via the browser's built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then, consider switching to a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Subtle changes often appear before obvious damage. Sudden redirects, new tabs opening on their own, unfamiliar search results, popups, slower browsing or websites asking you to re-log in unexpectedly can all signal a malicious or compromised extension. Pay attention if ads appear where they never did before or if your browser settings change without your input.",
      "Koi's investigation shows how attackers rely on patience. Once an extension earns trust and sits quietly for years, users stop watching it. That makes small behavior changes easy to miss. If something feels off, do not ignore it. Disable extensions one by one to identify the culprit. If the issue disappears, remove that extension permanently.",

It unfolded slowly, over years, and relied on trust most people never think twice about. Koi analysts connected the dots by tracking shared infrastructure across campaigns, but they also warn that some sleeper extensions may still be installed and trusted today. Browser extensions can be helpful, but every extra add-on is another door into your browser.

      "Malicious Chrome extensions hiding in plain sight",
      "Researchers at Socket discovered two Chrome extensions using the same name, \"Phantom Shuttle,\" that were posing as tools for proxy routing and network speed testing (via Bleeping Computer). According to the researchers, the extensions have been active since at least 2017.",
      "Both extensions were published under the same developer name and marketed toward foreign trade workers who need to test internet connectivity from different regions. They were sold as subscription-based tools, with prices ranging from roughly $1.40 to $13.60.",
      "At a glance, everything looked normal. The descriptions matched the functionality. The pricing seemed reasonable. The problem was what the extensions were doing after installation.",
      "How Phantom Shuttle steals your data",
      "Socket researchers say Phantom Shuttle routes all your web traffic through proxy servers controlled by the attacker. Those proxies use hardcoded credentials embedded directly into the extension's code. To avoid detection, the malicious logic is hidden inside what appears to be a legitimate jQuery library.",
      "The attackers didn't just leave credentials sitting in plain text. The extensions hide them using a custom character-index encoding scheme. Once active, the extension listens to web traffic and intercepts HTTP authentication challenges on any site you visit.",
      "To make sure traffic always flows through their infrastructure, the extensions dynamically reconfigure Chrome's proxy settings using an auto-configuration script. This forces your browser to route requests exactly where the attacker wants them.",
      "In its default \"smarty\" mode, Phantom Shuttle routes traffic from more than 170 high-value domains through its proxy network. That list includes developer platforms, cloud service dashboards, social media sites and adult content portals. Local networks and the attacker's own command-and-control domain are excluded, likely to avoid breaking things or raising suspicion.",
      "While acting as a man-in-the-middle, the extension can capture anything you submit through web forms. That includes usernames, passwords, card details, personal information, session cookies from HTTP headers and API tokens pulled directly from network requests.",
      "CyberGuy contacted Google about the extensions, and a spokesperson confirmed that both have been removed from the Chrome Web Store.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney Jay Edelson discusses the lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that ChatGPT exacerbated the mental illness and paranoid delusions of a man who killed his mother and then himself.",
      "Artificial intelligence chatbots are quickly becoming part of our daily lives. Many of us turn to them for ideas, advice or conversation. For most, that interaction feels harmless. However, mental health experts now warn that for a small group of vulnerable people, long and emotionally charged conversations with AI may worsen delusions or psychotic symptoms.",
      "Doctors stress this does not mean chatbots cause psychosis. Instead, growing evidence suggests that AI tools can reinforce distorted beliefs among individuals already at risk. That possibility has prompted new research and clinical warnings from psychiatrists. Some of those concerns have already surfaced in lawsuits alleging that chatbot interactions may have contributed to serious harm during emotionally sensitive situations.",

      "What psychiatrists are seeing in patients using AI chatbots",
      "Psychiatrists describe a repeating pattern. A person shares a belief that does not align with reality. The chatbot accepts that belief and responds as if it were true. Over time, repeated validation can strengthen the belief rather than challenge it.",
      "OPINION: THE FAITH DEFICIT IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SHOULD ALARM EVERY AMERICAN",
      "Mental health experts warn that emotionally intense conversations with AI chatbots may reinforce delusions in vulnerable users, even though the technology does not cause psychosis. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Clinicians say this feedback loop can deepen delusions in susceptible individuals. In several documented cases, the chatbot became integrated into the person's distorted thinking rather than remaining a neutral tool. Doctors warn that this dynamic raises concern when AI conversations are frequent, emotionally engaging and left unchecked.",
      "Why AI chatbot conversations feel different from past technology",
      "Mental health experts note that chatbots differ from earlier technologies linked to delusional thinking. AI tools respond in real time, remember prior conversations and adopt supportive language. That experience can feel personal and validating.",
      "For individuals already struggling with reality testing, those qualities may increase fixation rather than encourage grounding. Clinicians caution that risk may rise during periods of sleep deprivation, emotional stress or existing mental health vulnerability.",
      "How AI chatbots can reinforce false or delusional beliefs",
      "Doctors say many reported cases center on delusions rather than hallucinations. These beliefs may involve perceived special insight, hidden truths or personal significance. Chatbots are designed to be cooperative and conversational. They often build on what someone types rather than challenge it. While that design improves engagement, clinicians warn it can be problematic when a belief is false and rigid.",
      "Mental health professionals say the timing of symptom escalation matters. When delusions intensify during prolonged chatbot use, AI interaction may represent a contributing risk factor rather than a coincidence.",
      "OPENAI TIGHTENS AI RULES FOR TEENS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN",
      "Psychiatrists say some patients report chatbot responses that validate false beliefs, creating a feedback loop that can worsen symptoms over time. (Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "What research and case reports reveal about AI chatbots",
      "Peer-reviewed research and clinical case reports have documented people whose mental health declined during periods of intense chatbot engagement. In some instances, individuals with no prior history of psychosis required hospitalization after developing fixed false beliefs connected to AI conversations. International studies reviewing health records have also identified patients whose chatbot activity coincided with negative mental health outcomes. Researchers emphasize that these findings are early and require further investigation.",
      "A peer-reviewed Special Report published in Psychiatric News titled\u00a0\"AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health\" examined emerging concerns around AI-induced psychosis and cautioned that existing evidence is largely based on isolated cases rather than population-level data. The report states:\u00a0\"To date, these are individual cases or media coverage reports; currently, there are no epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses of the potentially deleterious mental health effects of conversational AI.\"\u00a0The authors emphasize that while reported cases are serious and warrant further investigation, the current evidence base remains preliminary and heavily dependent on anecdotal and nonsystematic reporting.",
      "What AI companies say about mental health risks",
      "OpenAI says it continues working with mental health experts to improve how its systems respond to signs of emotional distress. The company says newer models aim to reduce excessive agreement and encourage real-world support when appropriate. OpenAI has also announced plans to hire a new Head of Preparedness, a role focused on identifying potential harms tied to its AI models and strengthening safeguards around issues ranging from mental health to cybersecurity as those systems grow more capable.",
      "Other chatbot developers have adjusted policies as well, particularly around access for younger audiences, after acknowledging mental health concerns. Companies emphasize that most interactions do not result in harm and that safeguards continue to evolve.",
      "What this means for everyday AI chatbot use",
      "Mental health experts urge caution, not alarm. The vast majority of people who interact with chatbots experience no psychological issues. Still, doctors advise against treating AI as a therapist or emotional authority. Those with a history of psychosis, severe anxiety or prolonged sleep disruption may benefit from limiting emotionally intense AI conversations. Family members and caregivers should also pay attention to behavioral changes tied to heavy chatbot engagement.",

      "Tips for using AI chatbots more safely",
      "Mental health experts stress that most people can interact with AI chatbots without problems. Still, a few practical habits may help reduce risk during emotionally intense conversations.",
      "Avoid treating AI chatbots as a replacement for professional mental health care or trusted human support.Take breaks if conversations begin to feel emotionally overwhelming or all-consuming.Be cautious if an AI response strongly reinforces beliefs that feel unrealistic or extreme.Limit late-night or sleep-deprived interactions, which can worsen emotional instability.Encourage open conversations with family members or caregivers if chatbot use becomes frequent or isolating.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals don't always need malware or exploits to break into systems anymore. Sometimes, they just need the right words in the right place. OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web. This raises uncomfortable questions about how safe these tools really are, especially as they gain more autonomy and access to your data.",

      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "AI-powered browsers can read and act on web content, which also makes them vulnerable to hidden instructions attackers can slip into pages or documents. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why prompt injection isn't going away",
      "In a recent blog post, OpenAI admitted that prompt injection attacks are unlikely to ever be completely eliminated. Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.",
      "OpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that \"agent mode\" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.",
      "OpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.",
      "This isn't just OpenAI's problem. Earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI systems may never be fully mitigated.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "Prompt injection attacks exploit trust at scale, allowing malicious instructions to influence what an AI agent does without the user ever seeing it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The risk trade-off with AI browsers",
      "OpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.",
      "Where OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\" In simple terms, OpenAI trained an AI to act like a hacker. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.",
      "The bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.",
      "Even with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.",
      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "As AI browsers gain more autonomy and access to personal data, limiting permissions and keeping human confirmation in the loop becomes critical for safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to reduce risk with AI browsers",
      "You may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.",
      "Only give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.",
      "Never allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.",
      "A password manager ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Telling an AI browser to \"handle whatever is needed\" gives attackers room to manipulate it through hidden prompts. Be specific about what the AI is allowed to do and what it should never do. Narrow instructions make it harder for malicious content to influence the agent.",
      "When an AI browser scans emails, documents or web pages for you, remember that hidden instructions can live inside that content. Treat AI-generated actions as drafts or suggestions, not final decisions. Review anything the AI plans to act on before approving it.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There's been a meteoric rise in AI browsers. We're now seeing them from major tech companies, including OpenAI's Atlas, The Browser Company's Dia and Perplexity's Comet. Even existing browsers like Chrome and Edge are pushing hard to add AI and agentic features into their current infrastructure. While these browsers can be useful, the technology is still early. It's best not to fall for the hype and to wait for it to mature.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Researchers highlight the milestone that shows how a robot learned 1,000 real-world tasks in just one day. (Science Robotics)",
      "How robots learned 1,000 physical tasks in one day",
      "A new report published in Science Robotics caught our attention because the results feel genuinely meaningful, impressive and a little unsettling in the best way. The research comes from a team of academic scientists working in robotics and artificial intelligence, and it tackles one of the field's biggest limitations.",
      "The researchers taught a robot to learn 1,000 different physical tasks in a single day using just one demonstration per task. These were not small variations of the same movement. The tasks included placing, folding, inserting, gripping and manipulating everyday objects in the real world. For robotics, that is a big deal.",
      "Why robots have always been slow learners",
      "Until now, teaching robots physical tasks has been painfully inefficient. Even simple actions often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations. Engineers must collect massive datasets and fine-tune systems behind the scenes. That is why most factory robots repeat one motion endlessly and fail as soon as conditions change. Humans learn differently. If someone shows you how to do something once or twice, you can usually figure it out. That gap between human learning and robot learning has held robotics back for decades. This research aims to close that gap.",
      "THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST",
      "The research team behind the study focuses on teaching robots to learn physical tasks faster and with less data. (Science Robotics)",
      "How the robot learned 1,000 tasks so fast",
      "The breakthrough comes from a smarter way of teaching robots to learn from demonstrations. Instead of memorizing entire movements, the system breaks tasks into simpler phases. One phase focuses on aligning with the object, and the other handles the interaction itself. This method relies on artificial intelligence, specifically an AI technique called imitation learning that allows robots to learn physical tasks from human demonstrations.",
      "The robot then reuses knowledge from previous tasks and applies it to new ones. This retrieval-based approach allows the system to generalize rather than start from scratch each time. Using this method, called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer, the researchers trained a real robot arm on 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstration time.",
      "Importantly, this was not done in a simulation. It happened in the real world, with real objects, real mistakes and real constraints. That detail matters.",
      "Why this research feels different",
      "Many robotics papers look impressive on paper but fall apart outside perfect lab conditions. This one stands out because it tested the system through thousands of real-world rollouts. The robot also showed it could handle new object instances it had never seen before. That ability to generalize is what robots have been missing. It is the difference between a machine that repeats and one that adapts.",
      "AI VIDEO TECH FAST-TRACKS HUMANOID ROBOT TRAINING",
      "The robot arm practices everyday movements like gripping, folding and placing objects using a single human demonstration. (Science Robotics)",
      "A long-standing robotics problem may finally be cracking",
      "This research addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics: inefficient learning from demonstrations. By decomposing tasks and reusing knowledge, the system achieved an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional approaches. That kind of leap rarely happens overnight. It suggests that the robot-filled future we have talked about for years may be nearer than it looked even a few years ago.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Faster learning changes everything. If robots need less data and less programming, they become cheaper and more flexible. That opens the door to robots working outside tightly controlled environments.",
      "In the long run, this could enable home robots to learn new tasks from simple demonstrations instead of specialist code. It also has major implications for healthcare, logistics and manufacturing.",

      "According to the university, hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite. This application handles financial operations and contains highly sensitive data.",
      "Based on the technical details shared so far, security researchers believe the attack aligns with tactics used by the Clop ransomware gang. Clop has a long track record of stealing data through zero-day flaws rather than encrypting systems.",

A data removal service can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, which lowers the risk of targeted phishing or fraud tied to the stolen University of Phoenix records.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Expect more scam emails and phone calls. Criminals may reference the breach to sound legitimate.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "7) Secure your devices",
      "Keep your operating systems and apps up to date, as attackers often exploit outdated software to gain access. In addition, enable automatic updates and review app permissions to prevent stolen personal data from being combined with device-level access and causing further harm.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The University of Phoenix data breach highlights a growing problem in higher education. When attackers exploit trusted enterprise software, the fallout spreads fast and wide. While free identity protection helps, long-term vigilance matters most. Staying alert can limit damage long after the headlines fade.",

      "Witnesses told NBC News that it appeared Good was attempting to flee ICE as they approached her vehicle. Noem claimed during a press conference Wednesday that Good hit Ross, and Vice President JD Vance said the officer was acting in self-defense.

      "Court documents say Ross was dragged approximately 100 yards before he was able to free his arm from the car. DHS said in a news release he was dragged about 50 yards.",
      "Ross was injured and taken to the hospital for care, according to court documents. He sustained a cut on his right arm that required 20 stitches, a cut on his left hand that required 13 stitches, and abrasions to his left knee, elbows and face.",

      "The U.S. seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker threatened new pressure on the \u201cshadow fleet\u201d that has helped prop up President Vladimir Putin\u2019s economy.",
      "The American operation to take over the Bella 1 in the North Atlantic after a high-seas chase that began off Venezuela was \u201ca gross violation\u201d of maritime law, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said Thursday. It expressed \u201cregret and concern\u201d over Washington\u2019s \u201creadiness to generate acute international crisis situations.\u201d",
      "The saga has highlighted the mixed response in the country to the fallout from the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "While Moscow officially condemned the attack, its messaging has been restrained.",
      "Russia may be reluctant to anger Trump at a precarious moment for the Ukraine peace talks, especially as his approach to Venezuela appears to validate its view of the world as divided into great-power spheres of influence. And despite the complications for the Kremlin and its war effort, some influential voices have expressed jealousy at the effectiveness of the American operation.",
      "Out of the shadows",
      "After a weekslong chase across the Atlantic, the U.S. took over the Bella 1 on Wednesday in an operation that defied Russian warnings.",
      "The ship had changed its name to the Marinera and hoisted a Russian flag after escaping the U.S. blockade of Venezuela last month.",
      "On the U.S. sanctions list since June 2024, it was a \u201cposter child\u201d for the shadow fleet operations, said Richard Meade, editor-in-chief of Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence, a maritime data analysis company.",
      "\u201cIt has operated out of Iran, out of Russia, out of Venezuela. It\u2019s done all of it, and it\u2019s done all of it while cycling through various false identities, false flags, with questionable or no insurance. It\u2019s exactly what the shadow fleet is there to do. It\u2019s to operate in the shadows,\u201d Meade told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "Ships like it smuggle oil for countries facing international sanctions, such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran, and often conceal or spoof their location data. Many are barely seaworthy and often engage in ship-to-ship transfers of their cargo while at sea in an effort to obscure the oil\u2019s origin.",
      "Data from the International Maritime Organization ship registry shows that the tanker\u2019s registered owner is a company called Burevestmarine LLC, headquartered in Russia\u2019s western Ryazan region. The company appears in Russia\u2019s state commercial register and lists Ilya Bugai as the company\u2019s director. NBC News could not immediately identify a way to contact Bugai.",
      "Russia has faced a slew of new sanctions in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine, including on its oil. It has resorted to using the shadow fleet to sell its discounted crude oil to allies to keep afloat its economy, which has required enormous military investment to sustain the war.",
      "According to the Kyiv School of Economics\u2019 year-end analysis, Russia\u2019s shadow fleet continues to play a key role in transporting Russian oil. Its \u201cRussian Oil Tracker\u201d estimates that 173 Russian shadow fleet tankers carrying crude oil and oil products departed Russian ports and engaged in ship-to-ship transfers in the month of November.",
      "For years, Kyiv has been calling for a greater crackdown on Russia\u2019s shadow fleet.",
      "\u201cPutin uses these tankers to finance his war, and most of these vessels are old, poorly maintained, and operate without any oversight,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in late 2024. His foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Wednesday that Ukraine welcomed the tanker\u2019s seizure and Trump\u2019s \u201cact, not fear\u201d approach.",
      "And while the seizure of the Bella 1 is unlikely to break the Russian economy, it adds a layer of complexity for the Kremlin and leaves the fate of other tankers uncertain.",
      "At least three other sanctioned oil tankers that were operating near Venezuela in recent weeks have also changed their flags to Russia\u2019s, according to the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping.",
      "\u201cRussia is increasingly taking direct control of its export capabilities,\u201d said Meade. \u201cAnd certainly in the last four months, we have seen a rapid increase of shadow fleet ships flagging to Russia. Now, given that they were unable to protect the Marinera, the question is, Will shadow fleet operators be quite so willing to move into Russia, and will Russia really want to keep pursuing that agenda of taking direct control of the shadow fleet?\u201d",
      "A lot now depends on whether the U.S., and to some extent the European Union and the U.K., are going to be prepared to execute seizures like the one conducted on Wednesday to try and disrupt those exports via shadow fleet ships.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this was an anomaly or the start of a pattern of more robust enforcement,\u201d Meade said.",
      "What it means for Ukraine",
      "That uncertainty could be the reason behind Russia\u2019s muted response to the tanker seizure so far.",
      "While some Russian lawmakers have called it \u201cpiracy on the high seas,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry appealed for \u201chumane\u201d treatment of the tanker\u2019s crew even as it urged Washington \u201cto return to compliance with the fundamental norms and principles of international maritime navigation\u201d on Thursday.",
      "There has been no reaction from the Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson or Putin himself.",
      "Moscow may want to be careful not to offend Trump while he is negotiating a peace deal in Ukraine that at times has seen him support Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "It could also explain why Putin has not personally addressed the U.S. attack on Venezuela.",
      "The operation to remove Maduro is a blow to the Kremlin, depriving it of a longtime ally. But what Moscow\u2019s foreign ministry condemned as an \u201cact of armed aggression\u201d left some of its influential military bloggers jealous of Washington\u2019s success.",
      "When Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, he hoped to take Kyiv and capture Zelenskyy in as little as three days, expecting little resistance from Ukraine's army. His plan centered on seizing the Hostomel airfield, a crucial staging post for an assault on the capital, but Putin\u2019s forces got bogged down and eventually withdrew.",
      "Trump\u2019s removal of Maduro, which took hours and resulted in no U.S. deaths, drew admiration and unfavorable comparisons from Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cZ bloggers.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost likely, our own special military operation was conceived in much the same way: fast, effective,\u201d wrote prominent channel Two Majors, referring to the Kremlin\u2019s term for its war in Ukraine. Another prominent Z-blogger, Voenny Osvedomitel, called it a \u201cmodel military operation.\u201d",
      "Still, the focus on Venezuela could help distract from Putin\u2019s reticence to strike a deal with Ukraine.",
      "And Trump\u2019s stated desire to dominate the Western Hemisphere lends validation to the ideas underpinning the Kremlin\u2019s war: that great powers should be entitled to spheres of influence. In Putin\u2019s eyes, at least, Russia\u2019s sphere includes former Soviet states like Ukraine."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The House voted Thursday to revive expired Obamacare funds for three years, after a group of Republicans rebelled against their party leaders and teamed up with Democrats to force the vote.",
      "The vote was 230-196, with 17 Republicans joining a unanimous Democratic caucus to pass the legislation. Most of the breakaway GOP lawmakers represent swing districts and are wary of health care becoming a political vulnerability in the 2026 midterms.",
      "The bill would resurrect Affordable Care Act premium tax credits for about 22 million Americans after Republicans rejected bills last year to extend the money past the Dec. 31 deadline. Insurance premiums are estimated to double, on average, for those enrollees this year unless the funding is restored.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The legislation is projected to cost $80 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, while insuring 4 million more people and lowering premiums for others.",
      "It now goes to the Senate, where Republican leaders have pronounced it dead on arrival.",
      "While many GOP senators have no interest in resurrecting the ACA funds, some say they\u2019re open to a scaled-back version. A bipartisan Senate group is working toward a solution separate from the House bill, but they don\u2019t yet have an agreement that stands a chance of becoming law.",
      "Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, is pushing for a measure that would extend the ACA funds for two years with a series of changes, including limiting eligibility to 700% of the poverty level and a minimum premium of $5 per month even for the lowest earners.",
      "He said he wants to create an option for enrollees to redirect the enhanced tax credits to a health savings account, or HSA, from the second year onward. That is one challenge that may not get Democratic support. And he said he\u2019s still trying to figure out a way to impose abortion restrictions that many Republicans insist on, which has been the biggest sticking point for months.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the red zone,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cBut that does not mean a touchdown. It could mean a 95-yard fumble.\u201d",
      "The Senate group briefed House members on their tentative plan during a bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus meeting Thursday. Senators were closely watching the House vote as a potential driving force, a person in the room said. Their goal is to release a compromise bill next week before the Senate goes on recess the week of Jan. 19 for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.",
      "Other senators in both parties are less bullish.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see us getting to 60 votes on anything,\u201d said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., instead calling for Republicans to pursue a party-line health care bill through the filibuster-proof budget process.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who has led the negotiations for Democrats, said \u201cthere is continued work this week,\u201d but she\u2019s unsure when they will reach a deal.",
      "Shaheen also rejected the GOP demands for stricter abortion restrictions.",
      "\u201cThere is no need to come to a compromise because it\u2019s already been dealt with in the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is very specific language on how it is dealt with.\u201d",
      "Some House Republicans agree: Rep. Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa., said some senators seem inclined to skip stricter abortion language, arguing President Donald Trump\u2019s comments earlier this week to be \u201cflexible\u201d on the issue seemed to resonate with both parties.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said that in addition to abortion, any compromise must include a \u201cbridge\u201d to HSAs, where funds flow \u201cdirectly\u201d to consumers, and prohibit auto-enrollment by insurance companies from year to year. He also signaled he wants most Republican senators on board with any proposal to provide \u201ca healthy majority.\u201d",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., standing alongside House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters that an ACA funding extension is the \u201cNo. 1 thing to reduce costs immediately\u201d in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see what Republicans are willing to do to keep their word that they promised to lower the high cost of living in America,\u201d Schumer said prior to the House vote.",
      "Last fall, congressional Democrats withheld votes for a government funding bill by demanding an extension of the ACA funding, shutting the government down for a record 43 days.",
      "After House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other GOP leaders refused to relent, Jeffries filed a so-called discharge petition to try to force a vote on the matter.",
      "As the end-of-year deadline approached, four moderate Republicans bucked GOP leaders and joined all 214 Democrats in signing on to the petition, reaching the 218 threshold needed to force a floor vote. While the vote couldn\u2019t be held before lawmakers left town for the holidays, Jeffries\u2019 successful discharge petition ensured the vote would be held in the new year.",
      "Jeffries celebrated at the news conference with Schumer on Thursday.",
      "A coalition of Democrats and Republicans has joined together to \u201cprevent millions of everyday Americans from experiencing dramatically increased premiums, copays and deductibles that would prevent them from being able to go see a doctor when they need one,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe affordability crisis is not a hoax. It is very real, despite what Donald Trump has had to say,\u201d Jeffries continued. \u201cHousing costs are too high, grocery costs are too high, utility bills are too high, child care costs are too high, and health care costs are out of control.\u201d"

The subpoenas were seeking information about two civil fraud cases James brought against President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association.",
      "Sarcone \u201cpersonally directed the issuance of both subpoenas; his is the only name on the subpoenas and the documents sought are returnable to him personally,\u201d the judge wrote.",

Subpoenas issued under that authority are invalid,\u201d she wrote, finding Sarcone is disqualified from the investigation.",
      "A spokesperson for James said in a statement, \u201cThis decision is an important win for the rule of law and we will continue to defend our office\u2019s successful litigation from this administration\u2019s political attacks.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department and Sarcone's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

      "NASA said Thursday that it will bring four astronauts aboard the International Space Station back to Earth more than a month earlier than planned because of a medical issue \u2014 the first such evacuation in the space station\u2019s 25-year history.",
      "Citing medical privacy concerns, NASA did not provide additional details about the issue, including the identity of the affected crew member, the nature of the medical problem or its severity. Agency officials said the situation is stable, however.",
      "NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said at a news briefing that the astronauts will return home in the coming days. The agency has not yet given a precise timeline for undocking or landing.",
      "\u201cAfter discussions with chief health and medical officer Dr. JD Polk and leadership across the agency, I\u2019ve come to the decision that it\u2019s in the best interest of our astronauts to return Crew-11 ahead of their planned departure,\u201d Isaacman said.",
      "Isaacman added that further updates will be provided over the next 48 hours.",
      "The group leaving the International Space Station are NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. The astronauts, known as Crew-11, arrived there in early August and had been expected to stay aboard the orbiting laboratory until late February.",
      "Polk said that the situation is stable and that the evacuation is not considered an emergency. Rather, he said, the decision was made to err on the side of caution for the affected astronaut\u2019s health and welfare.",
      "\u201cWe have a very robust suite of medical hardware onboard the International Space Station, but we don\u2019t have the complete amount of hardware that I would have in the emergency department, for example, to complete a workup of the patient,\u201d Polk said. \u201cAnd in this particular incident, the medical incident was sufficient enough that we were concerned about the astronaut that we would like to complete that workup.\u201d",
      "NASA first made the medical issue public Wednesday, when it announced that it was postponing a spacewalk Cardman and Fincke were scheduled to conduct Thursday.",
      "After Crew-11\u2019s early departure, NASA will face several weeks with just one of its astronauts onboard the space station to oversee U.S. science experiments and operations \u2014 flight engineer Chris Williams, who launched aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on Nov. 27. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Platonov, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergey Mikaev are there with him.",
      "The next crew members are scheduled to launch to the ISS in mid-February, but Isaacman said NASA will evaluate whether to bump up that mission, known as Crew-12.",
      "This week\u2019s drama in orbit is the first major test for Isaacman: He was sworn in on Dec. 18."

    "story": [
      "After \"High School Musical\" star Ashley Tisdale penned a scathing first-person essay for The Cut about her \"toxic\" mom group, celebrities have been responding. And they are not, in fact, all in this together.",
      "In her essay, Tisdale wrote how she was initially energized by joining a mom group of friends who happened to be having babies at the same time. Eventually, however, she began to feel left out.",
      "Though Tisdale didn\u2019t name names \u2014 and in fact her rep denied that certain celebrities were part of the clique \u2014 there has been a huge amount of internet speculation about the identity of the other moms in the group.",
      "Meghan Trainor, who has been pegged by internet sleuths as a potential member of Tisdale's former mom crew, shared what seemed like a response to the drama on TikTok on Jan. 8.",
      "The video features an expressionless Trainor typing on a keyboard. The text reads, \"Me finding out about the apparent mom group drama.\" Playing in the background is Trainor's song, \"Still Don't Care,\" highlighting these lyrics: \"Let me take a moment, think it over. Does it touch me at all? Nope, I still don\u2019t care.\"",
      "In her essay, Tisdale wrote, \u201cTo be clear, I have never considered the moms to be bad people. (Maybe one.) But I do think our group dynamic stopped being healthy and positive \u2014 for me, anyway.\u201d",
      "She texted the group that she was leaving because it was getting \u201ctoo high school\u201d for her.",
      "Tisdale, 40, who goes by her married name of Ashley French on her blog, is a mother of two who rose to fame as a child actor in the 2000s on the Disney Channel. Never one to hold back, Tisdale has been outspoken about her personal struggles with mental health, alopecia and breastfeeding.",
      "Responses have been rolling in from other celebrities.",
      "On Jan. 6, Matthew Koma, Hilary Duff's husband, posted a fictional image on his Instagram stories.",
      "The photo looks almost exactly like Tisdale's photo from The Cut: Koma is wearing an almost identical outfit, sitting on a similar-looking off-white couch and striking the same unique pose. The Cut's logo appears in the corner, and the text reads, \"A Mom Group Tell All Through a Father's Eyes: When You're the Most Self Obsessed Tone Deaf Person On Earth, Other Moms Tend To Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.\"",
      "He also included the text: \u201cRead my new interview with @thecut.\u201d",
      "Another Disney Channel star, Christy Carlson Romano, also shared her feelings about mom groups on Instagram on Jan. 6.",
      "Moms of older kids sometimes end up \"cycling out of those friendships, and that kind of sucks,\" Romano said. When the dynamic shifts, moms often find a new group of friends.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be dramatic, but I get it. Sometimes it gets a little crazy and then you write an article about it,\" Romano concludes with a pointed glance at the camera.",
      "Tisdale's husband, Christopher French, shared a cryptic  Instagram message in his stories: \"Underrated life skill: Pausing to decide if it's worth your energy.\" The image was originally posted by @heycoryallen.",
      "Will this mom group rift have an ending worthy of a Disney Channel original movie? Or will the division continue to play out on social media?",
      "As one commenter on Romano's reel wrote, \"These Disney Channel mom group wars were not on my bingo card for 2026.\""

Her death immediately raises questions, especially when it\u2019s revealed that Jack had been having an affair with Rachel the night before she was killed. As Anna pushes to cover the case as a field reporter and Jack leads the investigation, both find themselves under suspicion, locked in a tense game of truth-telling and omission.",
      "Then, more women from Anna\u2019s past turn up dead: Helen Wang (Poppy Liu) and Zoe (Marin Ireland), each murder marked with friendship bracelets from their teenage years.",
      "Te series frames its central question clearly: Who killed Rachel, and which woman finally snapped?",
      "What Happened to Rachel in High School?",
      "By the finale, the show makes clear it was never about who lost control. It was about who remembered the past and decided to act on it.",
      "That past begins on Anna\u2019s 16th birthday.",
      "Anna, Rachel, Zoe, and Helen were once a tight-knit high-school friend group, inseparable on the surface. That night, under the guise of a celebration, Rachel, the group\u2019s ringleader, lured Anna and an awkward outsider named Catherine Kelly (Astrid Rotenberry) into the woods.",
      "What began as teenage cruelty escalated into something far darker. Older men were brought in. Photos were taken. Catherine managed to escape. Anna didn\u2019t. She was sexually assaulted while the girls she trusted stood by and watched.",
      "The trauma was buried for years, and the girls never told anyone.",
      "Catherine, meanwhile, reinvents herself through massive weight loss and plastic surgery.",
      "Years later, she returns to town under a new name, Lexi Jones (Rebecca Rittenhouse), as a polished, ambitious news anchor who takes over Anna\u2019s job during her absence. Her reappearance ties the violence of the past directly to the present-day investigation, making her a natural suspect, even though she isn\u2019t responsible for the murders.",
      "Who Killed Rachel, Zoe and Helen?",
      "It isn\u2019t until decades later, after Anna loses her three-month-old daughter to sudden infant death syndrome, a tragedy that shatters her marriage and sends her into a year-long disappearance, that the truth fully resurfaces.",
      "While going through old tapes and mementos, Anna\u2019s mother, Mrs. Andrews, discovers footage from that night in the woods and realizes what really happened to her daughter.",
      "For a woman already grieving the loss of her granddaughter and watching her daughter fall apart, the discovery becomes a breaking point.",
      "The series ultimately reveals that Mrs. Andrews is the killer. She fakes dementia to move unnoticed and uses spare keys from her years working as a house cleaner to methodically kill Rachel, Helen, and Zoe, the women she believes destroyed Anna\u2019s life. Each murder is marked by a friendship bracelet, transforming symbols of teenage loyalty into reminders of betrayal.",
      "When Anna reads her mother\u2019s confession in the finale, her reaction is what makes the ending so chilling. She cries and then smiles. She doesn\u2019t turn her mother in. She doesn\u2019t confront her. She accepts what was had been done for her.",
      "Anna then makes her own choice. She never tells Jack the full truth about the woods and that she, not Catherine, had been sexually assaulted. She allows the safer version of the story to stand. And she raises Zoe\u2019s daughter, knowing her own mother killed Zoe, reframing the murder as a twisted attempt to give Anna back the family she lost.",
      "By the final moments, Anna has everything she once wanted: her career, a future, a family.",
      "But it\u2019s built on silence.",
      "\"His & Hers\" doesn\u2019t end by solving a crime. It ends by asking a far darker question, one that lingers long after the credits roll: If the truth only causes more pain, is it still worth telling, or is survival its own form of justice?"

      "The premise is devilishly simple: A group of players must work together to complete challenges and build a prize fund, but hidden among them are \u201ctraitors\u201d whose job is to secretly eliminate their fellow contestants one by one. Meanwhile, the \u201cfaithful\u201d must figure out who the traitors are and vote them off before they\u2019re picked off themselves.",

      "Who is Rob Rausch?",
      "Rob Rausch, now 27, is a snake wrangler from Florence, Alabama, according to his \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 5 bio, and he grew up on a farm with three siblings.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d viewers know just how much Rausch loves wildlife. His expertise with snakes and other creatures became his calling card when he began posting snake-wrangling content in 2021 and amassed a devoted following. A quick scroll of his socials will show that he\u2019s still passionate.",
      "His Southern charm, good looks and fearless handling of dangerous reptiles kept an interest even post-\u201cLove Island USA\u201d; when he left the show, the wildlife enthusiast became a bonafide social media influencer. To date, Rausch has 2.2 million followers on TikTok and 1.4 million on Instagram.",
      "What is Rob Rausch Known For?",
      "While his snake-wrangling videos made him an internet sensation, it was reality TV that truly put Rausch on the map.",
      "He made his \u201cLove Island USA\u201d debut in Season 5 during the Casa Amor episodes \u2014 if you know, you know \u2014 but was dumped from the island just a few days later.",
      "The villa didn\u2019t bring Rausch love that first summer, but viewers were elated to see him return as an original cast member for \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6 the following year.",
      "This time, he lasted significantly longer in the show, coupling up with cast members like Leah Kateb, Andrea Carmona and Kassy Castillo as he searched for a meaningful connection.",
      "He was ultimately eliminated toward the end of Season 6. His fellow cast members later reunited for spinoff called \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa\u201d that followed their lives together in Los Angeles in 2025. Rausch, however, did not appear."

      "That second chance has arrived for Medley with Season 4, where she\u2019s joining a powerhouse lineup of reality TV veterans who know exactly how to play the game of alliances, betrayals and strategic eliminations.",
      "With her experience navigating the treacherous waters of \u201cHousewives\u201d drama, Medley may have found her perfect match in a game where being nice is optional, but making it to the end is everything."

    "link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/stranger-things-conformity-gate-fake-ending-theory-explained-rcna252763",
    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:57:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Stranger Things fans are convinced that the show didn't end. All about the Conformity Gate theory",
    "story": [
      "A group of \"Stranger Things\" fans are not ready for the story to be over.",
      "The viral theory dubbed Conformity Gate on social media proposes there is still one more episode left of the blockbuster Netflix hit beyond the two-hour series finale that was released on New Year's Eve.",
      "Fans believe that the real final episode will be released by Netflix on Jan. 7 to wrap up the story that ended in Episode 8 of Season 5, titled \"The Rightside Up.\" They think there is an Episode 9 that ends the series with a different storyline.",
      "Here's what to know about the online theories.",
      "What Is Conformity Gate?",
      "Warning: This section contains spoilers to the final season of \"Stranger Things.\"",
      "The epilogue to Episode 8 of the final season shows the long-time group of friends in fictional Hawkins, Indiana, graduate from high school and play a game of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" together like they did in the show's first season.",
      "Each character is then shown enjoying a happy ending to their individual story, from the romance between Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Max (Sadie Sink) continuing to Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) thriving in college to Will (Noah Schnapp) living with a boyfriend in New York.",
      "Fans labeled the ending \"Conformity Gate\" because it represented  a frictionless, conformist ending rather than embracing the show's themes of breaking with the norm and defying external expectations.",
      "Why Do 'Stranger Things' Fans Believe There is Another Episode?",
      "Fans have gone down the rabbit hole with lengthy TikTok explainers and videos of scenes from the show's five seasons edited together to back up their theories.",
      "A theme behind the theories is that the happy endings for everyone were all an illusion created by the monstrous Vecna, the show's main villain. A humanoid that first appeared in Season 4, Vecna was originally human Henry Creel (Jamie Campbell Bower), who was sent to an alternate dimension by the powers of Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and became a monster.",
      "Fans have pointed out that all the students portrayed in the Hawkins graduation scene are sitting with their hands folded. They have likened the pose to one Creel once made before he became Vecna, as well as the character Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery) when he was controlled by Vecna in Season 4.",
      "The ambiguous ending for Eleven, one of the show's primary characters, has also left fans divided over whether she died or not after defeating Vecna. Sink, who plays Max, has a clear position on it.",
      "Another image pushed by fans is that the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" binders owned by the main characters line up on a shelf to read \"X A LIE,\" which they think means that Vecna being beaten in Dimension X was a lie. However, on the show, it looks more like \"X AILE,\" which has no meaning.",
      "The speculation over the episode being released on Jan. 7 comes from multiple sources.",
      "Netflix released a cryptic teaser on Christmas saying \"Your Future is on its way\" with the date of Jan. 7, 2026, leading \"Stranger Things\" fans to thinking something big was coming even though it's not indicated in the video.",
      "The number seven also has meaning on \"Stranger Things\" because a die with the number seven facing up can be seen at the end of final episode to the right of a \"Stranger Things\" player manual. Noah Schnapp's character also rolls a seven while playing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" in the show's first episode in the first season.",
      "Is There Another Episode Coming?",
      "Netflix has seemingly made it clear that the show is over with the bio on its Instagram and X accounts for \"Stranger Things.\"",
      "\"ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING,\" the bio reads.",
      "Schnapp, who plays Will Byers, also spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the end of the show.",
      "\"I remember crying a lot at the final table read,\" he said. \"They had us read it for the first time all together and I just think it was perfect. They really left nothing more to be told.\"",
      "\"Once I wrapped, I felt it was time to let Will go,\" he continued. \"Now I\u2019ve really made peace with it, and especially sharing these final episodes with the fans, the fact that these stories have been told and the journeys are done. Even though the story is over, I\u2019ll take with me the lessons I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019m going to take the relationships with me forever, and I just hope this show can have a lasting, positive impact.\u201d",
      "For the final season, the streaming giant released the first four episodes on Thanksgiving, the next three on Christmas, and the final installment on New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "However, there is more coming out about Season Five. Netflix released a trailer on Jan. 5 for a documentary called \"One Last Adventure\" that will give a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the final season. The documentary starts streaming on Jan. 12.",
      "Twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, who created \"Stranger Things\" in 2016, were asked by the UK site Capital Buzz on Jan. 5 about theories that there is one more episode or an alternate ending that they shot and did not release.",
      "\u201cOh no,\u201d Matt Duffer said. \u201cI love when I hear people do that, but I\u2019m like, \u2018How do you have the time?\u2019 Oh my God! The energy to A, write it, and then shoot it. Are you crazy? No. No.\u201d",
      "While there is no indication of any secret episodes of \"Stranger Things,\" the Duffer brothers teased a spin-off of the show in a Jan. 1 interview with Variety. Matt Duffer said they will introduce \"completely new characters, new town, new world, new mythology.\u201d",
      "There also is a \"Stranger Things\" animated spin-off called \"Tales From '85\" set to come out in 2026."

The accord, signed in 2016, stipulated that the 195 participating nations would work to limit greenhouse gas emissions to ensure that the planet wouldn\u2019t warm more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with an upper limit of 2 degrees C.",
      "The UNFCCC created the underlying structure that the Paris Agreement later built upon. It was established in 1992 to inventory and begin to address the primary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. President George Bush signed the treaty after the Senate delivered its consent in a two-thirds vote.",
      "If the U.S. completes its exit from the UNFCCC \u2014 a process that takes a year \u2014 it would be the first country ever to do so. Re-entering the UNFCCC treaty would require a new two-thirds vote from the Senate, so Trump\u2019s withdrawal could make it difficult for a future president to rejoin the Paris Agreement.",
      "Withdrawing from the UNFCCC would also leave the U.S. as one of the only nations without representation at international climate talks. Already, the White House declined to send an official delegation to the latest U.N. climate summit, COP30, in Brazil last fall.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at all these conventions and the history of participation, even when countries were not really actively engaged in negotiations, it\u2019s pretty astonishing to walk away from the table and have decisions taken without your input,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, a climate scientist at the University of Washington who has contributed to several Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.",
      "Previous U.S. administrations have not always been enthusiastic participants in international climate discussions, Ebi added, but they still kept tabs on them.",
      "\u201cPeople showed up, sat in the back and did crossword puzzles and never said a word, but they wanted to hear what the discussions were,\u201d she said. Now, \u201cit\u2019s isolation.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has expressed open hostility for the UNFCCC and other international organizations. In a statement on X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them \u201canti-American, useless or wasteful.\u201d",
      "The U.S. will officially exit the Paris Agreement on Jan. 27 \u2014 roughly a year after the Trump administration initiated the nation\u2019s exit from the deal.",
      "However, legal questions remain as to whether Trump has the power to exit the UNFCCC without Congress\u2019 consent.",
      "Jean Su, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity who directs its energy justice program, said her organization views the move as illegal.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution has articulated what it takes to get into a treaty, which is two-thirds of the Senate majority, but it is actually silent on what it takes to leave a treaty,\u201d Su said. \u201cThere has not been affirmative case law either way as to whether a president can unilaterally pull out of a treaty that was approved by two-thirds of the Senate. So we are looking at legal action.\u201d",
      "The UNFCCC is the world\u2019s facilitator of global climate negotiations. Each year, a host country organizes a Conference of the Parties (COP), in which all participating nations meet to discuss things like emission targets and how to fund climate action globally. Last year\u2019s meeting focused, in part, on the Amazon rainforest and how to address deforestation and climate effects there. The UNFCCC secretariat helps organize these events, creating a structure and facilitating the meetings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like hosting the Olympics \u2014 you don\u2019t do that without the organization to help,\u201d Ebi said.",
      "When the U.S. left the Paris Agreement, it created a budget hole for the UNFCCC. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charity organization of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, stepped in to fill that gap and keep the secretariat operating.",
      "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), meanwhile, is an independent body designed to provide policymakers with the best science about climate change, its effects and how it could be addressed. This organization\u2019s reports form the scientific understanding for UNFCCC discussions and treaties.",
      "In a statement, Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, said Trump\u2019s exit \u201cwill leave the US less secure and less prosperous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe doors remain open for the US to reenter in the future, as it has in the past with the Paris Agreement,\u201d he added.",
      "Throughout his first year in office, Trump has made climate programs a target of dramatic budget cuts. He has called climate change a \u201ccon job,\u201d and the administration has taken steps to scuttle or downplay key climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment. It is working to remove the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that causes global warming.",
      "Former Vice President Al Gore, a climate activist, said Wednesday on X that the Trump administration has been \u201cturning its back on the climate crisis since day one,\u201d accusing it of catering to the interests of the oil industry while \u201cendangering people in America and around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy withdrawing from the IPCC, UNFCCC, and the other vital international partnerships, the Trump Administration is undoing decades of hard-won diplomacy, attempting to undermine climate science, and sowing distrust around the world,\u201d Gore said."

    "story": [
      "HAVANA \u2014 The ripple effects from the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday could make their way quickly here, devastating this island that has been in a yearslong economic crisis.",
      "Following the dramatic operation that ousted Maduro in the dead of night, President Donald Trump suggested Cuba\u2019s government will fall, something reiterated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.",
      "Since the rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999, Cuba has depended heavily on Venezuela for subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban medical professionals, military advisers, security forces and others. Without Venezuelan oil, Cuba\u2019s economy, which is already in a deep crisis, will likely spiral even further.",
      "\u201cIf oil supply were to cease entirely, the Cuban economy would grind to a halt,\u201d said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia. \u201cThis would represent a devastating blow to a Cuban economy already in recession for six years and lacking the productive capacity, competitiveness and foreign currency to replace these flows.\u201d",
      "Expecting more hardship",
      "In Cuba, where everyday people are accustomed to the dire economic situation, many are bracing themselves for even tougher conditions following the U.S. actions in Venezuela. The island and its government survived the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s when its economy shrank by roughly 30%.",
      "\u201cThe situation here is going to become very difficult,\u201d said Rey Rodriguez, a butcher. \u201cImagine what awaits us. Less oil, more blackouts \u2026 young people are going to become even more pessimistic.\u201d",
      "There are no oil tankers leaving Venezuela for Cuba based on satellite tracking services, according to Jorge Pi\u00f1\u00f3n, an energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. It doesn\u2019t mean \u201cghost ships\u201d with their transponders turned off haven\u2019t slipped in.",
      "Venezuela usually sends three or four tankers per month, which adds up to 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why the Venezuelan supply is so important, because those 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day represent 50% of the deficit that Cuba has of oil,\u201d Pi\u00f1\u00f3n said. The rest is supplied by Mexico and Russia.",
      "Weeks before the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel gave a bleak outlook of the economy during a speech at the National Assembly, saying the country\u2019s gross domestic product decreased over 4%, inflation shot up and the economy was \u201cpartially paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Content creator Pedro Luis Garc\u00eda said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the economic situation will be, but it will likely worsen because of the oil. But I don\u2019t think there can be a change of government, because the problems have been around since 1962, and this government is prepared for these types of situations.\u201d",
      "Cubans, under U.S. sanctions for decades, have been dealing with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel for the past few years, as the import-dependent island has seen its foreign currency revenues fall by about 30%.",
      "Its tourism sector, the second most important source of revenue for the government, has taken a hit in recent years and could drop even further if conditions on the island worsen.",
      "Cuba is also grappling with a trifecta of mosquito-borne illnesses including dengue and chikungunya virus that have affected almost one-third of the population. The situation has worsened with the government\u2019s inability to clear piles of trash that accumulate on streets and to carry out fumigation campaigns.",
      "For the past year, Cubans have faced prolonged blackouts because of the island\u2019s aging oil-fired power plants. Cuba\u2019s grid collapsed several times last year because of the outdated infrastructure and fuel shortages. Declining oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico have led to the rationing of electricity. The capital, Havana, once insulated from blackouts, now faces 10 hours or more without electricity each day. In other parts of the country, the blackouts can extend to 20 hours.",
      "Oil shipments from Venezuela are likely to stop if Trump gets his way.",
      "Cuba\u2019s second biggest supplier of oil, Mexico, is also facing pressure from Trump. He recently suggested the U.S. can take action against the country, saying drugs were \u201cpouring\u201d through Mexico and that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to do something.\u201d",
      "A defiant government response",
      "The day Maduro was captured, Cuba\u2019s president condemned and denounced the U.S. actions in a defiant speech. D\u00edaz-Canel said that U.S. actions were not about Maduro, his government or even drug trafficking, but that the \u201cobscure object of imperialist desire was Venezuelan petroleum, the lands and natural resources of Venezuela.\u201d",
      "D\u00edaz-Canel also said that \u201cfor Venezuela, and of course also for Cuba, we are willing to give our own blood, even our own lives, at a very high price.\u201d",
      "Cuba\u2019s government said 32 of its military and security personnel were killed Saturday.",
      "Cuba\u2019s state-run media, including television and the official newspaper Granma, published pictures of the 32 officers killed, along with their names, ages and ranks.",
      "In an interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, declined to say what kind of further actions the U.S. could take against Cuba.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.\u201d",
      "Cuba is already under heavy U.S. sanctions, but there are still other actions the U.S. can take. During Trump\u2019s first administration, the U.S. banned all flights to Cuba except for Havana.",
      "In Havana, former senior Cuban diplomat Carlos Alzugaray told NBC News, \u201cWe need to see what repercussions this will have. But the world hasn\u2019t ended as it seemed, and as Marco Rubio and Donald Trump would like to portray it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe they are using intimidation to see if they can affect relations between Venezuela and Cuba, which I would say are not currently affected because Cuba and most Cubans support Venezuela in condemning the U.S. aggression,\u201d he said.",
      "Alzugaray added that Cuba\u2019s government should be in the midst of intense conversations and consultations with its allies, like China and Russia.",
      "Cuba, with a Soviet-style command economy, has been unwilling to loosen restrictions on the private sector and open its economy to foreign investment, as many allies like Vietnam and China have urged it to do.",
      "Vidal, the economist, said that when the USSR collapsed, it took the Cuban economy four years to hit rock bottom and begin to recover. Tourism, remittances and foreign investment helped rescue the economy from collapse in those years, something that hasn\u2019t happened this time around.",
      "\u201cToday, there is widespread distrust among the Cuban government\u2019s own international allies regarding the viability of its economic model and its finances,\u201d Vidal said. \u201cIn the 1990s, there was a stronger and more respected political leadership, both nationally and internationally, which is not the case now.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou got to surrender,\u201d Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home.",
      "Maduro took the gamble of his life. He \u201ccame close\u201d to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",
      "As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing \u201cextraordinary insight\u201d into Maduro\u2019s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",
      "Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News \u2014 the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",
      "The same month, America\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, swept into the Caribbean, part of a military buildup that Trump believed got the attention of Maduro.",
      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",
      "At a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026.",
      "\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d he said.",
      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",
      "In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he\u2019ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business.",
      "\u201cThe Donroe Doctrine,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "The U.S. isn\u2019t leaving Venezuela soon, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to run it essentially until such time as a proper transition can take place.\u201d",
      "Looking back at his fateful phone call with Maduro, Trump suggested at the news conference that Maduro had chosen poorly in not heeding his command.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Trump said, \u201che wished he did.\u201d"

      "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Political reality is settling in for Venezuela as the regime once led by deposed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro tightens its hold on the country.",
      "Many Venezuelans opposed to Maduro\u2019s rule were overjoyed when U.S. special forces captured him over the weekend, believing this would be quickly followed by a transition to a form of a new government. But for some, these hopes have dimmed in recent days.",
      "No political prisoners appear to have been released, and the government is cracking down on any new signs of dissent, arresting people they said celebrated Maduro\u2019s capture by the United States military. The country\u2019s security and intelligence apparatus is out in force, with masked paramilitary \u201ccolectivos\u201d \u2014 armed civilians who support the government \u2014 roaming the streets on motorcycles, and military intelligence agents in civilian clothes circulating in vans with an official insignia and setting up roadblocks. The entire top leadership remains intact, with the notable exception of Maduro himself.",
      "The lack of change in government was underlined by a recent classified intelligence assessment that determined that top members of the Maduro regime \u2014 including former Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday \u2014 were best positioned to lead Venezuela\u2019s government and maintain stability.",
      "That assessment factored in President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of Maria Corina Machado, the exiled opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, as the best person to take over running the country, sources told NBC News.",
      "These developments were a gut-punch for Michelle, a resident of Caracas.",
      "\u201cFor many years I wished for my country\u2019s government to change, and I thought that when that day came I would feel very happy. But that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said the 34-year-old architect, who moved back to Venezuela last year. \u201cSomehow we will have to pay: either with oil or with our own dignity and sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Michelle and others who spoke to NBC News in Venezuela asked not to be fully identified out of fear the government would punish them.",
      "\u201cA dangerous precedent is being created between the United States and Latin America,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cWe realize that we are just another piece on the board in the struggle between powers, for whom the future of the Venezuelan people lacks relevance compared to the importance of valuable resources, which are worth more than life itself.\u201d",

On Tuesday he said Venezuela would \u201cbe turning over\u201d up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., adding that the revenue from the oil will be used to benefit both Americans and Venezuelans.",
      "But pessimism about recent events in Venezuela isn\u2019t shared by all opposition supporters, including former political prisoner Luis Mata.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like eating a pizza \u2014 they go slice by slice. We have to trust the process,\u201d the political activist and human rights defender living in exile told NBC News. Confusion surrounds the fate of the 800 to 900 political prisoners who remain incarcerated after the presidential elections on July 28, 2024.",
      "Mata, 26, was one of the thousands of volunteers who safeguarded vote tallies during the 2024 vote. The Maduro government overturned what independent election observers, rights groups and foreign governments said was a resounding opposition victory.",
      "Days after the election, Mata was detained by police officers as he tried to leave the city where he lived after hearing the government was looking for people who safeguarded the votes. He was charged with seven crimes and spent four months imprisoned in Tocor\u00f3n jail. He is now outside Venezuela.",
      "\u201cMany say the United States wants to seize the oil, but the United States is a trade ally. The United States supports freedom in Venezuela,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor me, change is closer than ever. Nicol\u00e1s is out of the country and will never set foot in Venezuela again,\u201d added Mata, who asked that NBC News not reveal his location out of security reasons. \u201cFreedom is about to arrive.\u201d",
      "Whether or not \u201cfreedom\u201d is about to sweep across Venezuela, the old regime is intent on projecting continuity. A striking symbol of this was when Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as president and the country\u2019s leadership marched shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the National Assembly on Monday.",
      "In the photograph released by the presidential palace, Rodr\u00edguez is flanked on one side by her brother and the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez.

Also surrounding her are seen minister of defense Vladimir Padrino, in full formal military uniform, and a smiling Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Guerra, the son of the ousted leader.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re going after anybody who potentially supported the U.S. mission to get Maduro,\u201d James Story, the last U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank.",

      "The U.S. seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker threatened new pressure on the \u201cshadow fleet\u201d that has helped prop up President Vladimir Putin\u2019s economy.",
      "The American operation to take over the Bella 1 in the North Atlantic after a high-seas chase that began off Venezuela was \u201ca gross violation\u201d of maritime law, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said Thursday. It expressed \u201cregret and concern\u201d over Washington\u2019s \u201creadiness to generate acute international crisis situations.\u201d",
      "The saga has highlighted the mixed response in the country to the fallout from the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "While Moscow officially condemned the attack, its messaging has been restrained.",
      "Russia may be reluctant to anger Trump at a precarious moment for the Ukraine peace talks, especially as his approach to Venezuela appears to validate its view of the world as divided into great-power spheres of influence. And despite the complications for the Kremlin and its war effort, some influential voices have expressed jealousy at the effectiveness of the American operation.",
      "Out of the shadows",
      "After a weekslong chase across the Atlantic, the U.S. took over the Bella 1 on Wednesday in an operation that defied Russian warnings.",
      "The ship had changed its name to the Marinera and hoisted a Russian flag after escaping the U.S. blockade of Venezuela last month.",
      "On the U.S. sanctions list since June 2024, it was a \u201cposter child\u201d for the shadow fleet operations, said Richard Meade, editor-in-chief of Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence, a maritime data analysis company.",
      "\u201cIt has operated out of Iran, out of Russia, out of Venezuela. It\u2019s done all of it, and it\u2019s done all of it while cycling through various false identities, false flags, with questionable or no insurance. It\u2019s exactly what the shadow fleet is there to do. It\u2019s to operate in the shadows,\u201d Meade told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "Ships like it smuggle oil for countries facing international sanctions, such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran, and often conceal or spoof their location data. Many are barely seaworthy and often engage in ship-to-ship transfers of their cargo while at sea in an effort to obscure the oil\u2019s origin.",
      "Data from the International Maritime Organization ship registry shows that the tanker\u2019s registered owner is a company called Burevestmarine LLC, headquartered in Russia\u2019s western Ryazan region. The company appears in Russia\u2019s state commercial register and lists Ilya Bugai as the company\u2019s director. NBC News could not immediately identify a way to contact Bugai.",
      "Russia has faced a slew of new sanctions in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine, including on its oil. It has resorted to using the shadow fleet to sell its discounted crude oil to allies to keep afloat its economy, which has required enormous military investment to sustain the war.",
      "According to the Kyiv School of Economics\u2019 year-end analysis, Russia\u2019s shadow fleet continues to play a key role in transporting Russian oil. Its \u201cRussian Oil Tracker\u201d estimates that 173 Russian shadow fleet tankers carrying crude oil and oil products departed Russian ports and engaged in ship-to-ship transfers in the month of November.",
      "For years, Kyiv has been calling for a greater crackdown on Russia\u2019s shadow fleet.",
      "\u201cPutin uses these tankers to finance his war, and most of these vessels are old, poorly maintained, and operate without any oversight,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in late 2024. His foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Wednesday that Ukraine welcomed the tanker\u2019s seizure and Trump\u2019s \u201cact, not fear\u201d approach.",
      "And while the seizure of the Bella 1 is unlikely to break the Russian economy, it adds a layer of complexity for the Kremlin and leaves the fate of other tankers uncertain.",
      "At least three other sanctioned oil tankers that were operating near Venezuela in recent weeks have also changed their flags to Russia\u2019s, according to the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping.",
      "\u201cRussia is increasingly taking direct control of its export capabilities,\u201d said Meade. \u201cAnd certainly in the last four months, we have seen a rapid increase of shadow fleet ships flagging to Russia. Now, given that they were unable to protect the Marinera, the question is, Will shadow fleet operators be quite so willing to move into Russia, and will Russia really want to keep pursuing that agenda of taking direct control of the shadow fleet?\u201d",
      "A lot now depends on whether the U.S., and to some extent the European Union and the U.K., are going to be prepared to execute seizures like the one conducted on Wednesday to try and disrupt those exports via shadow fleet ships.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this was an anomaly or the start of a pattern of more robust enforcement,\u201d Meade said.",
      "What it means for Ukraine",
      "That uncertainty could be the reason behind Russia\u2019s muted response to the tanker seizure so far.",
      "While some Russian lawmakers have called it \u201cpiracy on the high seas,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry appealed for \u201chumane\u201d treatment of the tanker\u2019s crew even as it urged Washington \u201cto return to compliance with the fundamental norms and principles of international maritime navigation\u201d on Thursday.",
      "There has been no reaction from the Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson or Putin himself.",
      "Moscow may want to be careful not to offend Trump while he is negotiating a peace deal in Ukraine that at times has seen him support Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "It could also explain why Putin has not personally addressed the U.S. attack on Venezuela.",
      "The operation to remove Maduro is a blow to the Kremlin, depriving it of a longtime ally. But what Moscow\u2019s foreign ministry condemned as an \u201cact of armed aggression\u201d left some of its influential military bloggers jealous of Washington\u2019s success.",
      "When Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, he hoped to take Kyiv and capture Zelenskyy in as little as three days, expecting little resistance from Ukraine's army. His plan centered on seizing the Hostomel airfield, a crucial staging post for an assault on the capital, but Putin\u2019s forces got bogged down and eventually withdrew.",
      "Trump\u2019s removal of Maduro, which took hours and resulted in no U.S. deaths, drew admiration and unfavorable comparisons from Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cZ bloggers.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost likely, our own special military operation was conceived in much the same way: fast, effective,\u201d wrote prominent channel Two Majors, referring to the Kremlin\u2019s term for its war in Ukraine. Another prominent Z-blogger, Voenny Osvedomitel, called it a \u201cmodel military operation.\u201d",
      "Still, the focus on Venezuela could help distract from Putin\u2019s reticence to strike a deal with Ukraine.",
      "And Trump\u2019s stated desire to dominate the Western Hemisphere lends validation to the ideas underpinning the Kremlin\u2019s war: that great powers should be entitled to spheres of influence. In Putin\u2019s eyes, at least, Russia\u2019s sphere includes former Soviet states like Ukraine."

      "The rial dropped to a record low of 1.46 million against the dollar Tuesday. If it continues to drop, it is unlikely that the protests will stop anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "HRANA, a network of rights activists, noted in a report Tuesday that 36 people have been killed since the demonstrations began 10 days ago \u2014 34 protesters and two members of the security forces \u2014 and that more than 2,000 people have been arrested.",
      "Dramatic videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show security forces firing tear gas at Tehran\u2019s main bazaar Tuesday as protesters scramble for cover into passageways and narrow streets. Gunshots can be heard in some videos, and protesters can also be heard chanting slogans directly against the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Unrest at the Tehran bazaar is particularly unsettling for officials because the shuttering of shops at the ancient marketplace and protests from the merchant class were key elements that led to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979.",
      "Another video shows a person using a makeshift flamethrower on security forces in the southern city of Shiraz.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as a relative moderate, in the past week called for protesters' demands to be heard and said he was asking the interior minister to meet with the leaders of the protest movement.",
      "But the head of Iran's judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, warned Wednesday that there would be \u201cno leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic.\u201d Accusing Israel and the U.S. of pursuing hybrid methods to disrupt the country, Ejei was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency as saying there was \u201cno excuse for those coming to the streets for riots and unrest.\u201d",
      "But the demonstrations are diffuse and largely leaderless, and Pezeshkian\u2019s efforts at mediation \u2014 and the killings and arrests by security forces \u2014 have not persuaded the protesters to stay off the streets.",
      "\u201cThe system has responded to these protests with a combination of conciliatory rhetoric and brute force,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a text message response to questions. \u201cThe fact that neither has worked indicates that the former falls well short of what the protesters want, and the latter has failed to deter them from expressing it.\u201d",
      "Protesters got an unexpected offer of support last week when President Donald Trump warned that the U.S. would intervene if violence against protesters continued, though he did not specify what actions the U.S. might take.",
      "Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said Friday on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "Analysts say Trump\u2019s message fed into the conspiracy theories of the most hard-line elements of the government, who were already on high alert for any foreign interference after a devastating 12-day war with Israel last summer, partly joined by the U.S. military, which left the country reeling.",
      "The detention of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a staunch Tehran ally, over the weekend only highlighted the issue for Iranian officials.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the operation to detain Maduro \"a clear example of state terrorism\" in a telephone call with his Venezuelan counterpart Saturday, according to the Iranian Foreign Affairs Ministry\u2019s official website.",
      "\u201cWhat the threshold for U.S. intervention would be, or what it might look like, is not entirely clear but the leadership in Tehran is likely worried about the prospect of dealing with not just instability from below but military action from abroad,\u201d Vaez said.",
      "Some of the worst violence in recent days took place in the small town of Malekshahi and nearby Ilam in western Iran. The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported that security forces opened fire on a crowd Saturday, killing five people and wounding more than 40 others.",
      "In a video posted on the organization\u2019s site, which was verified by NBC News, a crowd disperses quickly as multiple gunshots ring out and a handful of men return to pick up a man bleeding from a head wound.",
      "The wounded and dead from Saturday's violence in Malekshahi were taken to the Imam Khomeini hospital in Ilam, where security forces stormed the compound and used batons, tear gas and live fire, according to Hengaw. A video posted on the organization\u2019s site, which was verified by NBC News, shows a member of the security forces shooting into the hospital courtyard where people were gathered behind a gate.",
      "The U.S. State Department's Farsi language account on X posted a video of the security forces rushing into the Ilam hospital compound below text that read, \"Hospitals are not battlefields.\" The post also called the raid \"a crime.\"",
      "On Monday, Pezeshkian issued an order for the interior minister to investigate the unrest in Ilam province, according to the semi-official Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency.",
      "Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, an international affairs think tank in London, said the use of the security forces, the slowing down of the internet and the violence in smaller towns were part of a \u201ccrackdown playbook\u201d used by the government to deal with protests.",
      "\u201cThis is, of course, all part of a more organized effort, after a few lenient first days, to get people off of the streets as soon as possible,\u201d she said."

      "Few people are venturing from their homes, although businesses have begun to reopen and the long lines that had snaked outside the few pharmacies and supermarkets that were operational over the weekend are disappearing. Those trying to get to work using the public bus system seem to be struggling as it seems to be on a skeleton schedule.",
      "The more than half a dozen people who spoke to NBC News said that there has been an increased presence of government security forces as well as armed civilian paramilitaries loyal to the government. Officials have called for the arrest of anyone involved in the weekend\u2019s attack. For those who quietly oppose the Maduro government, they hope they\u2019re finally seeing the end of a dark period of their history. For those who supported him, there\u2019s the uncertainty of what will happen to their leader.",
      "Daniel, a gardener who commutes from his home on the outskirts of Caracas to the upscale neighborhood of Altamira, said he stayed home on Monday because he was afraid of encountering pro-government groups that are widely reported to be checking people\u2019s cellphones. Like everyone interviewed for this story, Daniel asked not to be fully identified out of fear of reprisal from authorities that are very much still in power.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Daniel said he was hopeful that sooner or later Venezuelans would have a country where they could express themselves freely and choose their own leaders.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t deny that the future makes me anxious, but I do trust that change can happen from now on,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "After an extraordinary weekend \u2014 when the country\u2019s authoritarian leader and his wife, Nicolas Maduro and Cilia Flores, were seized by U.S. special forces and American bombs rained down on military facilities, ports and power installations \u2014 the regime appears to be holding firm. President Donald Trump has made clear as of now that he supports the leadership of Maduro\u2019s vice president and successor, Delcy Rodriguez, who has said she is willing to work with the United States.",
      "Still, intractable issues remain. The government continues to be willing to use intimidation and violence to remain in power and shows few signs of trying to fix an economy that has trapped 90% of the population in poverty despite the country\u2019s vast oil wealth. Hundreds of people are still in prison after they were arrested during protests following the July 2024 election, where there was credible evidence Maduro\u2019s opposition won.",
      "On Sunday morning, Josefina and her husband, both 70-year-old retirees, were driving along Boyac\u00e1 Avenue, a highway that carves an east-to-west path across Caracas alongside Waraira Repano National Park. The road is popular on weekends when families take in the views of nature surrounding the city.",
      "What was supposed to have been a relaxing weekend outing turned nerve-wracking when the couple encountered a checkpoint. At first they thought it was \u201ccolectivos\u201d \u2014 armed civilians who support the Venezuelan government. Instead, a black van carrying the insignia of the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence, which is responsible for stopping espionage and intelligence threats, was parked behind the men.",
      "\u201cThey were dressed in civilian clothes and were heavily armed,\u201d Josefina said.",
      "Josefina and her husband got home fine since they likely are not seen as a threat to a government that is on highest alert. But on Monday, near the National Assembly around the time Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president, 14 journalists and press workers were detained. \u200bThirteen journalists have been released and one was deported, according to a local journalists\u2019 group.",
      "Some residents said they were afraid of the possibility of another U.S. attack.",

      "The European leaders were in Paris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff and others, according to a White House official. It is the latest in frenzied rounds of shuttle diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Though these negotiations have accelerated since November, the U.S. attack on Venezuela and continued suggestions of seizing Greenland have cast a shadow over the talks, which are being held with the very allies that \u2014 under NATO\u2019s principle of collective defense \u2014 Trump has suggested attacking.",
      "\u201cThe Kingdom of Denmark \u2014 including Greenland \u2014 is part of NATO,\u201d the allies said in a joint statement.",
      "\u201cSecurity in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them,\u201d said the statement, issued by the leaders of France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark.",

But Trump has indicated he may instead turn that might against a NATO ally, telling NBC News on Monday that he was \u201cvery serious\u201d in his ambitions to take control of Greenland.",
      "Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, took this a step further. He told CNN that \"obviously Greenland should be part of the U.S.\" because of what he described as the island's geostrategic importance in helping Washington fulfill its role as \"the power of NATO.\"",
      "\"The real question is, what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?\" he said. \"Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over Greenland,\" Miller added.",

      "Widespread protests have rocked Iran for more than a week and led to increasing violent clashes with security forces, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten intervention if a crackdown continues.",
      "The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country\u2019s leaders about how much support they really enjoy.",
      "Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\u201d He did not specify what this would mean.",
      "Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities.",
      "Last week, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to \u201cknock the hell out of\u201d Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program.",
      "Saturday\u2019s capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran\u2019s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as \u201ca clear example of state terrorism.\u201d But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year.",
      "\u201cIranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive feelings,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn\u2019t willing to reform or change,\u201d Vakil said,",
      "Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran\u2019s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say.",
      "The country\u2019s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country\u2019s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems.",
      "\u201cIf the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don\u2019t look for America or someone else to blame,\u201d Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. \u201cWe need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.\u201d",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian\u2019s powers in dealing with the protests.",
      "\u201cHe is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,\u201d Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime\u2019s inherent corruption and incapacity,\u201d Milani said. \u201cThey want the regime changed.\u201d",
      "Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests, including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump\u2019s threats of intervention will encourage the protesters or lead security forces to hold their fire.",
      "\u201cPeople could feel slightly more confident and emboldened thinking that the United States might actually be more than rhetorically supportive,\u201d said Vakil of Chatham House. \u201cBut I worry that they might be disappointed, not understanding that the United States is very much focused on outcomes and interests that benefit the United States and not really benevolent towards the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "Still, whether the protests expand and continue or are crushed by force like similar protests in 2022 and 2023 \u2014 when approximately 500 people were killed and thousands were arrested \u2014 will largely depend on the will of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThey will have a scorched-earth policy,\u201d Milani from Stanford said."

      "Moreover, he said, the U.S. may subsidize an effort by oil companies to rebuild the country's energy infrastructure \u2014 a project he said could take less than 18 months.",
      "\"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money,\" he said. \"A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they\u2019ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.\"",
      "He also insisted the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela.",
      "\"No, we\u2019re not,\" Trump said. \"We\u2019re at war with people that sell drugs. We\u2019re at war with people that empty their prisons into our country and empty their drug addicts and empty their mental institutions into our country.\"",
      "In the roughly 20-minute interview, Trump identified a group of U.S. officials \u2014 including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 who will help oversee America\u2019s involvement in Venezuela.",
      "\"It's a group of all. They have all expertise, different expertise,\" he said.",

He was seized from a compound in the capital city of Caracas in the wee hours of Saturday morning during a raid by U.S. special forces and law enforcement officials.",
      "Maduro pleaded not guilty, saying he remains the leader of his country even as Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in Monday as his successor.",
      "Trump said Rodr\u00edguez has been cooperating with U.S. officials but insisted there was no communication between her camp and the American side before Maduro's ouster.",
      "\"No, that\u2019s not the case,\" he said, adding that a determination will be made soon about whether existing sanctions against Rodr\u00edguez will be left in place or lifted.",
      "When asked if there was \"any deal with any official in Venezuela to remove\" Maduro, Trump replied, \"Well, yeah, because a lot of people wanted to make a deal, but we decided to do it this way,\" adding that it was without the help of Maduro's inner circle.",
      "Trump also declined to say whether he's spoken to Rodr\u00edguez yet, but he said that Rubio \"speaks to her fluently in Spanish\" and that their \"relationship has been very strong.\"",
      "He indicated that the U.S. could launch a second military incursion into Venezuela if Rodr\u00edguez stops cooperating with U.S. officials but said he does not believe that will be necessary. Trump also suggested he had initially expected to have to send in American forces again already.",
      "\"We\u2019re prepared to do it,\" he said. \"We anticipated doing it, actually.\"",
      "Trump also denied a Washington Post report that he had dismissed the possibility of Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado running the country because she won the Nobel Peace Prize last year \u2014 an award long sought by Trump.",
      "\"She should not have won it,\" he said. \"But no, that has nothing to do with my decision.\"",
      "Having campaigned on an \"America First\" platform and his desire to end wars, rather than start them, Trump has seen some of his political allies question the wisdom of the U.S. entering into a long-term commitment in Venezuela.",
      "But he said in the interview that he is confident his political base will stick with him.",

      "Trump\u2019s longtime threats to seize Denmark\u2019s territory of Greenland have been widely derided in Europe, mocked even, as outlandish talk that could surely never translate into the United States effectively invading a NATO ally.",
      "But Trump's willingness and ability to capture Maduro \u2014 and his suggestion that Greenland and its own vast natural resources may be next \u2014 have raised worries that there may be more to this Arctic ambition.",
      "It has triggered the strongest protests yet against Washington\u2019s hostile overtures, including from longtime U.S. allies in Europe.",
      "\u201cNo more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation,\u201d Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post Sunday.",
      "\u201cWhen the president of the United States talks about \u2018we need Greenland\u2019 and connects us with Venezuela and military intervention, it\u2019s not just wrong. This is so disrespectful,\u201d he added. \u201cOur country is not an object of superpower rhetoric. We are a people. A land. And democracy. This has to be respected. Especially by close and loyal friends.\u201d",
      "Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, was more forthright Monday. \u201cIf the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops,\u201d she told public broadcaster DR, according to Reuters.",
      "\u201cI have made it very clear where the Kingdom of Denmark stands, and Greenland has repeatedly said that it does not want to be part of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have for months said they want to take over the vast semi-autonomous Danish territory, citing its strategic importance and mineral wealth. After Maduro\u2019s capture, he doubled down on the idea, telling reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, \u201cWe need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you.\u201d",
      "He mocked local efforts to defend the sparsely populated island, saying \u201cthey added one more dog sled\u201d that would be no match for the \u201cRussian and Chinese ships\u201d he claimed were \u201call over the place\u201d around the territory.",

      "While some are drawing parallels between the United States\u2019 dramatic action in Venezuela and China\u2019s ambitions for Taiwan, experts say Beijing is less concerned about the self-ruled island\u2019s sovereignty and instead views the attack as an opportunity to undermine America\u2019s global leadership.",
      "As the Trump administration withdraws from global institutions and upends long-standing norms, Beijing has sought to cast itself as the true champion of the rules-based international order. Chinese state media commentaries on the Venezuela attack argue that the U.S. is now one of the biggest threats to that order, and that its actions have undermined its credibility in Latin America.",
