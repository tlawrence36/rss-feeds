      "Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Soyinka said he believed it had little to do with him and was instead a product of the United States' immigration policies. He said he was told to reapply if he wished to enter again.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about me, I\u2019m not really interested in going back to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a principle is involved. Human beings deserve to be treated decently wherever they are.\u201d",
      "Soyinka, who has taught in the U.S. and previously held a green card, joked on Tuesday that his green card \u201chad an accident\u201d eight years ago and \u201cfell between a pair of scissors.\u201d In 2017, he destroyed his green card in protest of President Trump's first inauguration.",
      "The letter he received informing him of his visa revocation cites \u201cadditional information became available after the visa was issued,\u201d as the reason for its revocation, but does not describe what that information was.",

      "PARIS -- More than 100 investigators are racing to piece together how thieves pulled off the brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, working to recover the stolen gems and bring those responsible to justice.",
      "The daytime theft of centuries-old jewels from the world's most-visited museum thought to be of significant cultural and monetary value has captured the world's attention for its audacity and movie plot-like details.",
      "But thus far little has been revealed about how the investigation is unfolding, a source of frustration for those accustomed to the 24-hour flow of information in American true crime or British tabloids.",
      "Suspects, like the jewels themselves, have remained out of sight, the case file cloaked in mystery and French authorities characteristically discreet.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Sunday that more details would come once the suspects\u2019 custody period ends, likely around midweek, depending on the charges. But here's what we know so far about the case:",
      "Authorities said it took mere minutes for thieves to ride a lift up the side of the museum, smash display cases and steal eight objects worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19. The haul included a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense.",
      "Beccuau has not publicly announced what charges the suspects could face, though French media have reported that the charges include criminal conspiracy and organized theft, which can carry hefty fines and yearslong prison sentences.",
      "Beccuau said investigators made several arrests Saturday evening but didn\u2019t name them or say how many. One suspect, she added, was stopped at a Paris airport while trying to leave the country.",
      "In France, where privacy laws are strict, images of criminal suspects are not made public as they often are elsewhere. Suspects aren\u2019t paraded before cameras upon arrest or shown in mugshots.",
      "The presumption of innocence is inscribed in France's constitution and deeply valued throughout society. The French often express shock at the spectacle of criminal trials in the United States, including in 2011 when media outlets photographed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then a candidate in France's presidential election, on a \u201cperp walk\u201d to a New York prison after he was indicted on charges he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. The charges were eventually dismissed.",
      "Information about investigations is meant to be secret under French law, a policy known as \u2033secret d\u2019instruction\" and only the prosecutor can speak publicly about developments.",
      "Police and investigators are not supposed to divulge information about arrests or suspects without the prosecutor's approval, though in previous high-profile cases, police union officials have leaked partial details. Beccuau on Saturday rued the leak of information about the ongoing investigation.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria.",

      "Interpol, the world\u2019s largest international police network, does not issue arrest warrants. But if authorities worry a suspect may flee, Interpol can circulate the information using a color-coded notice system.",
      "The French investigators can also work with European authorities if required. They can turn to the European Union\u2019s judicial cooperation agency, Eurojust, or its law enforcement agency, Europol. Eurojust works through judicial cooperation between prosecutors and magistrates, while Europol works with police agencies.",

      "Beccuau said more details would be released once the suspects' time in custody expires. How long that lasts depends on what they\u2019re accused of. If, as French media have reported, they\u2019re being investigated for criminal conspiracy, they can be held for up to 96 hours before charges are filed.",

      "Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos.",
      "Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed.",
      "\u201cI must quote Dan Rather,\u201d she said in a 1994 interview. \u201cI can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me.",
      "\u201cI love rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding \u2014 the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don\u2019t go with my image.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: \u201cAll This and Heaven Too,\u201d \u201cAdam Had Four Sons,\u201d \u201cSergeant York,\u201d \u201cMiss Annie Rooney,\u201d \u201cForever and a Day\u201d and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis.\u201d",
      "She also made \u201cSon of Lassie,\u201d the 1945 sequel to \u201cLassie, Come Home,\u201d playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in \u201cLassie\u201d on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show\u2019s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.)",
      "Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies \u201care bigger, the ruff is bigger, they\u2019re more imposing looking.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap.",
      "\u201cLassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.\u201d",
      "After six years in the rural setting of \u201cLassie,\u201d Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",

      "The presence of a Greek navy band playing mournful music was indicative of the change in Savvopoulos\u2019s status, from someone lionized by anarchist-leaning leftists in the 1960s and 1970s and dismissed by the establishment as a long-haired freak, to a figure embraced by the same establishment and cultural mainstream.",

A few of his songs drew the enmity of some of his longtime admirers. The beard grew back but his politics remained moderate.",
      "Conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the first of many who eulogized Savvopoulos during the funeral service, used the lyrics of the 1972 song \u201cMessenger Angel\" to portray the artist as a speaker of uncomfortable truths that many did not want to hear. \u201cIf he had no pleasant news to tell/better tell us none,\u201d he quoted the song's ending.",
      "Others who joined in eulogizing Savvopoulos were former President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, fellow musicians, artists and literary figures, some from his hometown of Thessaloniki, and one of his two grandsons.",

      "Younger generations of Americans are increasingly citing climate change as making them reticent to have children",
      "Amanda Porretto isn't sure she'll ever have children.",
      "At 27, she is the average age of new mothers in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She's feeling the pressure as an only child. Her father wants to be a grandfather and her mother, before she died, always told Porretto that she would eventually want to be a mom.",
      "\u201cSome people think it's a bad thing\u201d not to have a child, said Porretto, who works in advertising. \u201cI just don't think I need to bring more people into (the world) when there's so much here currently that we need to fix.\u201d",
      "Younger generations of Americans are increasingly citing climate change as making them reticent to have children, according to several studies. They are worried about bringing children into a world with increasing and more intense extreme weather events, a result of climate change, which is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when oil, gas coal are burned. And they are concerned about the impact their offspring will have on the planet.",
      "In a 2024 Lancet study of people 16 to 25 years old, the majority of respondents were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d worried about climate change. The study also found that 52% said they were hesitant to have children because of climate change. Adults under 50 years old without children were four times more likely than adults over 50 without children to say that climate plays a factor in their decision, according to a Pew Research Center report published last year. And a study published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found more than half of respondents said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d to whether climate change made them question having children.",
      "Parenthood and climate change are related not just because of fears for a child's well-being, but also by concern for the planet's well-being.",
      "Compared to the carbon emissions of all the other decisions, \"having a child is by far, by orders of magnitude, larger,\u201d said Nandita Bajaj, executive director of Population Balance, which is a nonprofit focused on humans' environmental impact.",
      "Unlike other choices, procreation comes with something that bioethics professor Travis Rieder of Johns Hopkins University calls \u201ccarbon legacy.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not only doing carbon expensive activities like buying a larger house and a larger car and diapers and all that,\" said Rieder. \u201cYou\u2019re also creating someone who is going to have their own carbon footprint for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "That child might have children, and those children might have children, creating an impact that lasts generations, Rieder added. Of course, the logical extreme of minimizing an environmental footprint means having no children, Rieder said, which he is not advocating.",
      "It's tricky to quantify the impact of a child. That's because there's no consensus on what percentage of their impact is the parent's responsibility, and partly because the impact of that child depends on their parents' lifestyle.",
      "\u201cOne of the best predictors of how carbon-expensive they\u2019ll be is how wealthy you are,\u201d Rieder said.",
      "For example, the U.S. emits 123 times more carbon emissions than Ghana, according to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. Adjusted for population size, that means the average American emits more than 12 times as much as the average Ghanan.",
      "Procreation might have the largest climate impact, but when it comes to actions people can take to reduce their personal contribution to global warming, having fewer children often isn't discussed.",
      "Researchers who study climate change and family planning give two reasons.",
      "\u201cIf a person tells you that they\u2019re expecting or that they are pregnant, the immediate response is to offer some kind of support, congratulate them, that sort of thing,\" said Trevor Hedberg, who teaches moral philosophy at the University of Arizona.",

    "story": [
      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035.

      "Pope Leo XIV has reaffirmed the Catholic Church's commitment to fighting antisemitism amid rising tensions from Israel's war in Gaza",
      "ROME -- Pope Leo XIV acknowledged Wednesday that there had been misunderstandings and conflicts with Jews over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. But he strongly confirmed the Catholic Church\u2019s condemnation of antisemitism and commitment to fighting it as part of Christians\u2019 Gospel-mandated friendship with the Jewish people.",
      "At a time of rising antisemitism stemming from Israel\u2019s war, Leo adopted as his own the Vatican\u2019s official position abhorring antisemitism as he marked the 60th anniversary of a landmark Vatican document that revolutionized the Catholic Church\u2019s relations with Jews.",
      "Leo dedicated his Wednesday general audience to the anniversary of the \u201cNostra Aetate\u201d declaration, speaking to a crowd that included several Jewish leaders and representatives of other religions who had come to Rome this week to participate in anniversary celebrations.",
      "In the text, \u201cNostra Aetate,\u201d Latin for \u201cIn Our Time,\u201d the Catholic Church deplored antisemitism in every form and repudiated the \u201cdeicide\u201d charge that blamed Jews as a people for Christ\u2019s death.",
      "The idea of Jewish collective guilt for the crucifixion had fueled antisemitism for centuries. The Vatican crafted the document repudiating it as the church reckoned with the role traditional Christian teaching had played in the Holocaust.",
      "Leo quoted the document as saying the Catholic Church decries \u201chatred, persecutions, displays of antisemitism, directed against Jews at any time and by anyone\u201d and noted that all his predecessors since then had clearly condemned antisemitism.",
      "\u201cAnd so I, too, confirm that the church does not tolerate antisemitism and fights against it, on the basis of the Gospel itself,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe cannot deny that there have been misunderstandings, difficulties and conflicts in this period, but these have never prevented the dialogue from continuing,\u201d he added. \u201cEven today, we must not allow political circumstances and the injustices of some to divert us from friendship, especially since we have achieved so much so far.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s anniversary comes amid a surge in antisemitism linked to Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks. In the United States alone, the Anti-Defamation League says the number of antisemitic incidents  reached a record high last year, with 58% of the 9,354 incidents related to Israel, notably chants, speeches and signs at rallies protesting Israeli policies.",
      "The war has similarly strained the Vatican\u2019s relations with the Jewish community. Pope Francis repeatedly angered Jewish and Israeli leaders with comments they perceived as drawing a moral equivalence between the Hamas attacks and Israel\u2019s military actions.",
      "Francis did meet with relatives of hostages taken by Hamas and called repeatedly for them to be returned. But he called for an investigation to determine if Israel\u2019s attacks in Gaza constitute genocide and said Israel\u2019s military response was disproportionate.",

      "\u201cThis historic increase to home care funding reflects the complex and growing needs of Holocaust survivors worldwide,\u201d said Gideon Taylor, the president of the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference.",

      "Additionally, the Hardship Fund Supplemental payments, which were previously guaranteed to be paid annually to eligible Holocaust survivors until 2027, have been extended through 2028 at an amount of \u20ac1,450 per survivor, impacting more than 127,000 Holocaust survivors globally.",
      "The Claims Conference projected in April that approximately 200,000 survivors are still alive, most of them living in Israel, the United States and Europe, but also scattered all over the globe.",
      "Also, righteous rescuers \u2013 non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust - currently receiving a monthly pension from the Claims Conference, will be eligible to receive home care similar to that provided to Jewish survivors, allowing them to live their final years with dignity in their own homes, the group announced.",

      "The policy partly is meant to prevent carbon leakage, a term for when companies move to countries with less stringent climate regulations.",
      "While the tax covers around 70% of Singapore\u2019s emissions, the NCCS has not disclosed the exact amount of emissions reductions brought on by the carbon tax. It says it is \u201cdifficult to isolate the exact amount of emissions reductions\u201d and that more information will be provided \u201cin due course.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe can\u2019t even come to a conclusion about whether the carbon tax is effective because we don\u2019t have the data,\u201d said Rachel Cheang, co-founder of Energy CoLab, a youth-led local climate group. \u201cAny conversation with the government is just not on equal ground.\u201d",
      "The city-state\u2019s carbon tax started at 5 Singapore dollars ($3.7) per ton of emissions. It has risen gradually, to 25 Singapore dollars ($19) per metric ton last year, and will be 45 Singapore dollars ($34.70) in 2026. By the end of this decade, it\u2019s expected to be 50-80 Singapore dollars (about $40-$60) per metric ton.",
      "The carbon tax burden falls most heavily on global energy companies \u2014 like ExxonMobil, which operates Singapore\u2019s largest refining facility on Jurong Island; Shell, which runs the country\u2019s oldest refinery on Pulau Bukom and Chevron, which has a 50% interest in the Singapore Refining Co.",

      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point Wednesday for the second time since September. Before that, it had gone nine months without a cut.",
      "The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another. While the rates consumers pay to borrow money aren\u2019t directly linked to this rate, shifts affect what you pay for credit cards, auto loans, mortgages, and other financial products.",
      "\u201cWhile the full economic impact of such a move will unfold over time, early indicators suggest that even modest rate cuts can have meaningful consequences for consumer behavior and financial health,\" said Michele Raneri, vice president and head of U.S. research at credit reporting agency TransUnion.",
      "The Fed has two goals when it sets the rate: one, to manage prices for goods and services, and two, to encourage full employment. Typically, the Fed might increase the rate to try to bring down inflation and decrease it to encourage faster economic growth and increase hiring. The challenge now is that inflation is higher than the Fed\u2019s 2% target but the job market has been weak. The government shutdown has also prevented the collection and release of data the Fed relies on to monitor the health of the economy.",
      "Still, the Fed has projected it will cut rates once more before the end of the year.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "For savers, falling interest rates will slowly erode attractive yields currently on offer with certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts.",
      "Three of the top five high yield savings accounts had rate cuts after the last Fed rate cut in September, according to Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com, while two of the big five banks (Ally and Discover/Capital One) cut their savings account rates. The top rates for high yield savings account right now remain around 4.46% to 4.6%.",
      "Those are still better than the trends of recent years, and a good option for consumers who want to earn a return on money they may want to access in the near-term. A high yield savings account generally has a much higher annual percentage yield than a traditional savings account. The national average for traditional savings accounts is currently 0.63%, according to Bankrate.",
      "There may be a few accounts with returns of about 4% through the end of 2025, according to Tumin, but the Fed cuts will filter down to these offerings, lowering the average yields as they do.",
      "For prospective homebuyers, the market has already priced in the rate cut.",
      "\u201cMortgage rates, in particular, have responded swiftly,\u201d said Raneri. \u201cJust in the past week, they fell to their lowest level in over a year. While mortgage rates don\u2019t always move in lockstep with the Fed\u2019s target rate \u2014 often pricing in anticipated future cuts, the continued easing of monetary policy may well push rates even lower.\u201d",

      "Americans have faced steeper auto loan rates over the last three years after the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate starting in early 2022. Those are not expected to decline anytime soon. While a cut will contribute to eventual relief, it might be slow in arriving, analysts say.",
      "\u201cIf the auto market starts to freeze up and people aren\u2019t buying cars, then we may see lending margins start to shrink, but auto loan rates don\u2019t move in lockstep with the Fed rate,\u201d Kates said.",

      "Boeing reported mixed third-quarter results on Wednesday, as higher aircraft deliveries and a growing backlog of orders were offset by continued certification delays for its 777X jets.",
      "CEO Kelly Ortberg said the first delivery of its next generation of long-haul, wide-body jets is now expected in 2027 instead of 2026, resulting in a $4.9 billion charge in the quarter through September. But Ortberg emphasized in a call with analysts that the delays stemmed from the certification process, and not from any newly discovered technical issues.",
      "\u201cWhile we are disappointed in the 777 delays, it shouldn't overshadow the progress we're making,\" he said.",
      "Ortberg said Boeing was making progress on stabilizing its production. The aerospace giant delivered 160 planes in the third quarter, the most quarterly deliveries since 2018. The same time last year, Boeing said it delivered 116 planes.",
      "Boeing also reported that its backlog of orders, including 5,900 commercial planes, had grown to $636 billion in the third quarter.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s strong demand in our products,\u201d Ortberg said in an interview Wednesday morning with CNBC.",
      "In September, the Federal Aviation Administration restored Boeing's ability to perform final safety checks and certify 737 Max jets for flight more than six years after two crashes of the then-new aircraft killed 346 people.",
      "That decision was followed by the FAA's move this month to raise Boeing's 737 Max production limit that it had set in January 2024, after a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines jet. Boeing is now allowed to build 42 Max jets per month, up from 38, and Ortberg said Wednesday that the company expects to raise that cap further once it demonstrates to the FAA that it can do so safely.",
      "If the FAA approves future production boosts, Ortberg said, they'd come in increments of five jets and wouldn't happen more than once every six months.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t move to higher rates until we reach stability and readiness,\u201d he said.",
      "Boeing also reported $238 million in free cash flow, marking its first cash flow-positive quarter since 2023. But that figure was partly boosted by a delay in a potential $700 million payment to the Justice Department, part of a still-pending deal under consideration by a federal judge that could spare Boeing from criminal prosecution in the two deadly 737 Max crashes.",

      "SINGAPORE, Singapore -- Carbon tax concessions granted to global oil giants may undermine incentives to shift to cleaner energy, environmentalists fear.",
      "So conservation groups in Singapore are seeking more transparency over what discounts the city-state of 6 million giving polluters for taxes on their climate-changing emissions. Singapore is the only Southeast Asian country to have imposed a carbon tax so far. Most of the European Union, California, South Korea and Japan also do so.",
      "Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are preparing to implement similar taxes next year and Vietnam and Brunei are considering the idea. The groups are pressing the Singaporean government to disclose more information about \u201callowances\u201d Singapore\u2019s National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) has awarded to certain companies.",
      "The government says the tax breaks are \u201cnot a free pass\" for corporations to continue emitting. But it has balked at providing details or even full data about the impact of the carbon tax.",
      "Singapore accounts for only 0.1% of global carbon emissions, but its emissions per person were 27th highest out of 142 countries, said Vinod Thomas, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, a Singapore-based think tank.",
      "\u201cSingapore is being watched and is being seen as a leader,\u201d Thomas said, adding that \"it matters to a great extent what others will do. If one country alone reduces emissions, that's great. But the atmosphere only cares about the total, so it is critical the rest of Southeast Asia also plays its part.\"",
      "Implemented in 2019, the carbon tax was set to increase every few years to allow emissions-intensive, trade-exposed companies time to invest in cleaner technologies.",
      "But the island nation has granted closed-door concessions to certain businesses.",
      "The NCCS says the deals are private because corporations raised valid concerns about how information on allowances could be used to compromise their business strategies and operations. Only facilities with credible plans for ending their net carbon emissions have been granted partial concessions, it said.",
      "The policy partly is meant to prevent carbon leakage, a term for when companies move to countries with less stringent climate regulations.",
      "While the tax covers around 70% of Singapore\u2019s emissions, the NCCS has not disclosed the exact amount of emissions reductions brought on by the carbon tax. It says it is \u201cdifficult to isolate the exact amount of emissions reductions\u201d and that more information will be provided \u201cin due course.\u201d",
      "Local climate groups issued a joint letter in September demanding more information about the scale and scope of the tax breaks, contending that \u201ctransparency is not incompatible with competitiveness.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t even come to a conclusion about whether the carbon tax is effective because we don\u2019t have the data,\u201d said Rachel Cheang, co-founder of Energy CoLab, a youth-led local climate group. \u201cAny conversation with the government is just not on equal ground.\u201d",
      "The city-state\u2019s carbon tax started at 5 Singapore dollars ($3.7) per ton of emissions. It has risen gradually, to 25 Singapore dollars ($19) per metric ton last year, and will be 45 Singapore dollars ($34.70) in 2026. By the end of this decade, it\u2019s expected to be 50-80 Singapore dollars (about $40-$60) per metric ton.",
      "The carbon tax burden falls most heavily on global energy companies \u2014 like ExxonMobil, which operates Singapore\u2019s largest refining facility on Jurong Island; Shell, which runs the country\u2019s oldest refinery on Pulau Bukom and Chevron, which has a 50% interest in the Singapore Refining Co.",

      "In the buildup to the summit, members hold a series of ministerial and other meetings to discuss practical cooperation on various issues, and economists have credited the forum with helping reduce tariffs and other trade barriers in past years.",

      "A federal appeals court has overturned a landmark decision in an opioid lawsuit in West Virginia",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned a landmark decision in West Virginia that had rejected attempts by an opioid-ravaged area to be compensated by U.S. drug distributors for a influx of prescription pain pills into the region.",
      "The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, ruled that a lower court judge erred when he said West Virginia's public nuisance law did not apply to the lawsuit involving the distribution of opioids.",
      "\u201cWest Virginia law permits abatement of a public nuisance to include a requirement that a defendant pay money to fund efforts to eliminate the resulting harm to the public,\u201d the 4th Circuit wrote. \u201cWest Virginia has long characterized abatement as an equitable remedy.\u201d",
      "The ruling sends the case back to U.S. District Court in Charleston for \u201cfurther proceedings consistent with the principles expressed in this opinion.\u201d",
      "Thousands of state and local governments have sued over the toll of opioids. The suits relied heavily on claims that the companies created a public nuisance by failing to monitor where the powerful prescriptions were ending up. Most of the lawsuits were settled as part of a series of nationwide deals that could be worth more than $50 billion. But there wasn\u2019t a decisive trend in the outcomes of those that have gone to trial.",
      "In July 2022, U.S. District Judge David Faber ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors who were accused by Cabell County and the city of Huntington of causing a public health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in the county. AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp. also were accused of ignoring the signs that Cabell County was being ravaged by addiction.",
      "Faber said West Virginia\u2019s Supreme Court had only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids \u201cis inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.\u201d",
      "Last year the federal appeals court sent a certified question to the state Supreme Court, which states: \u201cUnder West Virginia\u2019s common law, can conditions caused by the distribution of a controlled substance constitute a public nuisance and, if so, what are the elements of such a public nuisance claim?\u201d",
      "The state justices declined to answer. That 3-2 opinion in May returned the case to the federal appears court.",

      "During arguments earlier this year before the state Supreme Court over the certified question, Steve Ruby, an attorney for the companies, called \u201cradical\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments to extend the public nuisance law to opioid manufacturers. If allowed, he said, that would \u201ccreate an avalanche of activist litigation.\u201d",
      "The appeals court previously noted that the West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel, which works to resolve complex cases in state court, has concluded in several instances that opioid distribution \u201ccan form the basis of a public nuisance claim under West Virginia common law.\u201d",
      "In his 2022 decision, Faber also said the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn\u2019t hold a proper registration from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.",
      "But the 4th Circuit Court found Tuesday that the lower court \u201cmisconstrued the distributors\u2019 duties\u201d under the Controlled Substances Act.",

      "The Senate approved a resolution Tuesday evening that would nullify President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Brazil, including oil, coffee and orange juice, as Democrats test GOP senators\u2019 support for Trump\u2019s trade policy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a resolution Tuesday evening that would nullify President Donald Trump's tariffs on Brazil, including oil, coffee and orange juice, as Democrats tested GOP senators' support for Trump's trade policy.",
      "The legislation from Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, passed on a 52-48 tally.",
      "It would terminate the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify 50% tariffs on Brazil, but the legislation is likely doomed because the Republican-controlled House has passed new rules that allow leadership to prevent it from ever coming up for a vote. Trump would almost certainly veto the legislation even if it were to pass Congress.",
      "Still, the vote demonstrated some pushback in GOP ranks against Trump\u2019s tariffs. Five Republicans \u2014 Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina \u2014 all voted in favor of the resolution along with every Democrat.",
      "Kaine said the votes are a way force a conversation in the Senate about \u201cthe economic destruction of tariffs.\u201d He's planning to call up similar resolutions applying to Trump's tariffs on Canada and other nations later this week.",
      "\u201cBut they are also really about how much will we let a president get away with? Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not?\u201d Kaine told reporters.",
      "Trump has linked the tariffs on Brazil to the country's policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cEvery American who wakes up in the morning to get a cup of java is paying a price for Donald Trump\u2019s reckless, ridiculous, and almost childish tariffs,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.",
      "Republicans have also been increasingly uneasy with Trump's aggressive trade policy, especially at a time of turmoil for the economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last month that Trump\u2019s tariff policy is one of several factors that are expected to increase jobless rates and inflation and lower overall growth this year.",
      "In April, four Republicans voted with Democrats to block tariffs on Canada, but the bill was never taken up in the House. Kaine said he hoped the votes this week showed how Republican opposition to Trump's trade policy is growing.",
      "To bring up the votes, Kaine has invoked a decades-old law that allows Congress to block a president\u2019s emergency powers and members of the minority party to force votes on the resolutions.",
      "However, Vice President JD Vance visited a Republican luncheon on Tuesday in part to emphasize to Republicans that they should allow the president to negotiate trade deals. Vance told reporters afterwards that Trump is using tariffs \"to give American workers and American farmers a better deal.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t see a need to do that right now,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, adding that it was \u201cbad timing\u201d to call up the resolutions before the Supreme Court case.",

      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has drafted what\u2019s known as an interpretative rule related to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, interpreting the law in a way that says the FCRA should preempt any state laws or regulations when it comes to how debt should be reported to the credit bureaus like Experian, Equifax and Trans Union.",
      "This repeals previous Biden-era rules and regulations that allowed states to implement their own credit reporting bans. More than a dozen states like New York and Delaware prohibit the reporting of medical debt on a consumers\u2019 credit report.",
      "Medical debt is often the most disputed part of a consumer\u2019s credit report, because insurance payments can take time, and oftentimes patients do not have the means to fully pay a medical bill if insurance is not covering a procedure that has already taken place.",
      "The three credit bureaus jointly announced in 2023 they would no longer track any medical debts below $500, which at the time the bureaus said would eliminate 70% of all medical debts reported on consumers\u2019 credit files. But some states have gone further than that. New York, Delaware and others passed laws where medical debts can no longer be reported to the credit bureaus.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its short-term rate Wednesday for the second time this year despite an increasingly cloudy view of the economy it is trying to influence.",
      "The government shutdown has cut off the flow of data that the Fed relies on to track employment, inflation, and the broader economy. September's jobs report, scheduled for release three weeks ago, is still postponed. This month's hiring figures, to be released Nov. 7, will likely be delayed and may be less comprehensive when they are finally released. And the White House said last week that October's inflation report may never be issued at all.",
      "The data drought raises risks for the Fed because it is widely expected to keep cutting rates in an effort to shore up growth and hiring. Fed officials signaled at their last meeting in September that they would likely implement rate reductions in October and December, and financial markets now consider a cut in December to be a near-certainty.",
      "Yet should job gains pick up soon, the Fed may not detect the change. And if hiring rebounds after weak job gains during the summer, further rate cuts may not be justified.",
      "On Tuesday, payroll processor ADP released a new weekly measure of hiring by businesses, using payroll data from millions of clients. It shows that in late September and earlier this month, companies resumed adding jobs, after shedding workers in July and August.",
      "Still, a key reason rate cuts are so widely expected is that most Fed officials see its key rate, which is now about 4.1%, to be high enough that it is restraining the economy's growth. Under this view, the Fed can cut several more times before reaching a level that might provide unnecessary stimulus to the economy.",
      "Before the government shutdown cut off the flow of data Oct. 1, monthly hiring gains had weakened to an average of just 29,000 a month for the previous three months, according to the Labor Department's data. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-low 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July.",
      "Meanwhile, last week\u2019s inflation report \u2014 released more than a week late because of the shutdown \u2014 showed that inflation remains elevated but isn\u2019t accelerating and may not need higher interest rates to tame it.",
      "The government's first report on the economy's growth in the July-September quarter was scheduled to be published on Thursday, but will be delayed, as will Friday's report on consumer spending that also includes the Fed's preferred inflation measure.",

The change could over time slightly reduce longer-term interest rates on things like mortgages but aren't likely to have a major impact on consumer borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed purchased nearly $5 trillion of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds from 2020 to 2022 to stabilize financial markets during the pandemic and keep longer-term interest rates low. The bond-buying lifted its securities holdings to $9 trillion.",

      "In the past three years, however, the Fed has reduced its holdings to about $6.6 trillion. To shrink its holdings, the Fed lets securities mature without replacing them, reducing bank reserves. The risk is if it reduces its holdings too far, short-term interest rates could spike as banks borrow money to top-up their reserves.",
      "In 2019, the Fed was reducing its balance sheet and caused a sharp, unexpected spike in short-term rates that disrupted financial markets, an outcome they want to avoid this time.",
      "The Fed currently is reducing its holdings of mortgage-backed securities by up to $35 billion a month and Treasuries by just $5 billion a month.

      "Air traffic controllers are missing another paycheck due to the ongoing government shutdown, raising concerns about financial stress affecting their work",
      "Air traffic controllers will miss their paychecks Tuesday because of the ongoing government shutdown, raising concerns that mounting financial stress could take a toll on the already understaffed employees who guide thousands of flights each day.",
      "Flight delays are becoming more common across the country as more controllers call out sick because the Federal Aviation Administration was already so short on controllers before the shutdown.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association Nick Daniels have continued to emphasize the pressure that controllers are feeling. They say the problems are likely to only get worse the longer the shutdown continues.",
      "Not only are controllers worrying about how to pay for their mortgages and groceries, but Daniels said some of them are also grappling with how to pay for the medicine needed to keep their children alive. Duffy said he heard from one controller who had to tell his daughter she couldn't join the traveling volleyball team she had earned a spot on because he couldn't afford the cost during the shutdown.",
      "\u201cAir traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\u201d Daniels said Tuesday at a news conference alongside Duffy at LaGuardia Airport in New York. \u201cAnd I\u2019m watching air traffic controllers going to work. I\u2019m getting the stories. They\u2019re worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I\u2019m running out of money. And if she doesn\u2019t get the medicine she needs, she dies. That\u2019s the end.'\u201d",
      "The FAA restricts the number of flights landing and taking off at an airport anytime there is a shortage of controllers to ensure safety. Most of the time that has meant delays \u2014 sometimes hours long \u2014 at airports like New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport or Burbank airport in California. But over the weekend, Los Angeles International Airport actually had to stop all flights for nearly two hours.",
      "Controllers are planning to assemble outside at least 17 airports nationwide Tuesday to hand out leaflets urging an end to the shutdown as soon as possible. Worrying about how to pay their bills is driving some to take second jobs to make ends meet.",

      "The number of controllers calling in sick has increased during the shutdown both because of their frustration with the situation and because controllers need the time off to work second jobs instead of continuing to work six days a week like many of them routinely do. Duffy has said that controllers could be fired if they abuse their sick time, but the vast majority of them have continued to show up for work every day.",
      "Air traffic controller Joe Segretto, who works at a regional radar facility that directs planes in and out of airports in the New York area, said morale is suffering as controllers worry more about money.",
      "\u201cThe pressure is real,\u201d Segretto said. \"We have people trying to keep these airplanes safe. We have trainees \u2014 that are trying to learn a new job that is very fast-paced, very stressful, very complex \u2014 now having to worry about how they\u2019re going to pay bills.\"",
      "Duffy said the shutdown is also making it harder for the government to reduce the longstanding shortage of about 3,000 controllers. He said that some students have dropped out of the air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City, and younger controllers who are still training to do the job might abandon the career because they can't afford to go without pay.",
      "\u201cThis shutdown is making it harder for me to accomplish those goals,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "The longer the shutdown continues, pressure will continue to build on Congress to reach an agreement to reopen the government. During the 35-day shutdown in President Donald Trump's first term the disruptions to flights across the country contributed to the end of that disruption. But so far, Democrats and Republicans have shown little sign of reaching a deal to fund the government.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence weakened slightly in October as Americans remain anxious about their future financial prospects.",
      "The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell by 1 point to 94.6 in October from an upwardly revised September reading of 95.6. Economists were expecting the reading to come in unchanged from the previous month. One year ago, the reading was 109.5.",
      "A measure of Americans\u2019 short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market dipped by 2.9 points to 71.5, remaining well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead.",
      "However, consumers\u2019 assessments of their current economic situation rose 1.8 points to 129.3.",
      "Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers\u2019 biggest concern. Mentions of tariffs declined again this month but remain elevated, the Conference Board said.",
      "Last week, government data showed that inflation in the U.S. remained elevated in September as gas prices jumped while the cost of rents cooled, painting a mixed picture for consumers. While the economy is still growing steadily, hiring remains slow and more high-profile companies have recently announced layoffs.",
      "Consumer prices increased 3% in September from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Friday, the highest since January and up from 2.9% in August.",
      "The report on the consumer price index was issued more than a week late because of the Oct. 1 government shutdown.",
      "Federal Reserve officials have signaled that they will cut their key interest rate at their meeting Wednesday. It would be the second time this year even though inflation is above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Fed officials have cited increasing concerns about the U.S. labor market, which, while broadly healthy by historical standards, is showing signs of deterioration this year.",
      "Responses to the Conference Board\u2019s latest survey revealed that while respondents were slightly more positive about current job market, they are growing more concerned about their future employment prospects.",
      "The most recent government jobs report showed that U.S. nonfarm employers added a paltry 22,000 jobs in August, following July\u2019s disappointing 79,000 job gains. Worse, revisions to the May and June figures shaved 258,000 jobs off previous estimates. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, the highest since October 2021.",

The multipurpose facility, which is being built by private investors, is slated to become Italy\u2019s largest indoor arena and is a majestic sight to those arriving into the southeastern periphery of Milan.",
      "ICE PARK: While the ice hockey finals will be held in the Santagiulia Arena, some matches will take place in the Fiera Milano exhibition venue, which will also host the speed skating. The trade fair complex, which opened in 2005 in the northwest of Milan, will use temporary structures for the games. The so-called Ice Park will occupy four pavilions of the huge exhibition center and comprise the Speed Skating Stadium and the Rho Ice Hockey Arena, which still needs to be completed. The Speed Skating Stadium was delivered in August and the work to lay down the ice was set to start on Wednesday.",
      "ICE SKATING ARENA: Short-track speed skating and figure skating events will take place in the Forum di Milano, a multipurpose facility that is mainly used for basketball, ice hockey and tennis as well as live concerts. The 12,500-capacity venue in the southwestern outskirts of Milan was opened in 1990 and renovated in 2017, the year before it hosted the figure skating world championships.",
      "TOFANE ALPINE SKIING CENTER: Regularly referred to as the queen or the pearl of the Dolomites, Cortina hosted the Winter Olympics in 1956. The Olympia delle Tofane course will be the site of the women\u2019s Alpine skiing next year. The iconic slope is a regular stop on the women\u2019s World Cup circuit and also held the world championships in 2021.",
      "CURLING OLYMPIC STADIUM: Curling will take place in the Olympic Ice Stadium, one of the legacies of the 1956 Games, when it also hosted the opening ceremony. The arena \u2014 and Cortina in general \u2014 also served as a filming location for the 1981 James Bond film \u201cFor Your Eyes Only,\u201d starring Roger Moore.",
      "CORTINA SLIDING CENTER: The century-old sliding center in Cortina has been completely rebuilt for the 2026 Games at a cost of 118 million euros ($123 million) amid staunch opposition from the International Olympic Committee. The timeframe was so tight that it necessitated a Plan B option that would have required moving bobsled, luge and skeleton events all the way to Lake Placid, New York. However, it appears the gamble has paid off with the IOC even saying recently that the venue has \u201csurpassed expectations.\u201d The track secured preliminary certification in March and test events are taking place through November. Completion of the roofing and all the facilities next to the track is scheduled for Nov. 5.",

Veteran Italian skier Christof Innerhofer told The Associated Press that he can\u2019t remember a tougher course at the Olympics in the past 30 years. The Stelvio Ski Center will also be the venue for ski mountaineering, which will be making its Olympic debut. Bormio is about 200 kilometers (120 miles) northeast of Milan.",
      "Livigno, about an hour's drive north of Bormio, will host the sports that are perhaps most popular among young people. Snowboarding and freestyle skiing will be held at Livigno Snow Park and Livigno Aerials and Moguls Park, with 26 medals awarded. The small town in Valtellina, near the border with Switzerland, proudly unveiled the Aerials and Moguls Park last December, boasting that it had delivered the first 2026 Olympic venue.",
      "Surrounded by the peaks of the Dolomites, Predazzo will be a stunning setting for the ski jumping events. Predazzo, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Cortina, is the most populated municipality in Val di Fiemme, an area which has a rich history of hosting Nordic skiing world championships and World Cup races. The ski jumping facility spans an area of 3,000 square meters (32,000 square feet) and consists of two main ramps for international competitions as well as training ramps and other equipped spaces for athletes.",
      "Tesero, less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Predazzo, will host the cross-country skiing events. The cross-country skiing stadium was opened in 1990, the year before the area hosted the Nordic World Ski Championships for the first time.",
      "The biathlon competition will be held in Anterselva, nestled in the South Tyrol mountains and with 60 kilometers (40 miles) of tracks. The Anterselva Biathlon Arena has a rich history with the sport, having hosted the world championships multiple times since the 1970s. It also hosts World Cup races every year. The town itself, which is near the border with Austria, has a unique cultural heritage: more than 98% of the population speak German as their mother tongue.",
      "The closing ceremony will take place at the historic Verona Arena, a large Roman amphitheater built almost 2,000 years ago that is mainly used to host large-scale opera performances. It is an imposing presence in the main piazza of Verona, which is a UNESCO world heritage city. Originally built to host 30,000 spectators in ancient Roman times, it currently has a capacity of around half that for its world-famous summer festival. About 15,000 spectators will be allowed for the closing ceremony on Feb. 22.",

      "A live camera pans in every direction along the Rettenbach glacier in Soelden, Austria \u2014 a way to show the snow status at the resort in the Alps. Instead of blankets of snow everywhere leading into a season-opening World Cup ski race, the images reflected a light dusting \u2014 thanks to a recent snowfall \u2014 over the rocks, rubble and dirt.",
      "The notable exception was the majestic ribbon of mainly manufactured snow in place for the race last weekend. Granted, it\u2019s early in the season in Soelden. But this sort of minimal-snow scene is playing out all over the planet. The current images at Copper Mountain in Colorado, which is hosting a series of races next month, show only a light coating of snow.",
      "As Earth warms at a record rate, winters are shorter and milder and there is less snow globally, creating clear challenges for winter sports that depend on cold, snowy conditions. With 100 days until the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympic Games begin, many athletes say climate change is shaping their training and perhaps even the future of their sport.",
      "As snowboarder Bea Kim is focused on earning a spot to represent Team USA at the Winter Olympics, she's also thinking about how long she will be able to do what she loves.",
      "\u201cI'm worried,\" Kim said, \"for the future of winter.\u201d",
      "Canadian freestyle skier Marion Th\u00e9nault trains in the mountains close to her team\u2019s home base in Quebec City. Two seasons ago, they couldn't jump there until late in the season because there wasn't enough snow. In January, they instead trained in Park City, Utah.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re chasing the snow,\" she said. \"One of the things that is sad is we\u2019re increasing our environmental impact by chasing the snow, so we\u2019re also contributing to the problem.\u201d",
      "Air travel is a significant contributor to climate change because burning jet fuel releases carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.",
      "Th\u00e9nault has reduced her own environmental impact by taking buses and trains instead of short flights, not flying home in between competitions and biking all summer. She is working with her sponsor, engineering firm WSP, on a proposal for clustering competitions geographically to reduce air travel.",
      "\u201cAt this rate right now, we are not moving in the right direction,\" she said. \u201cBut we can do something about it.\u201d",
      "When smoke from Canadian wildfires poured into the United States this summer, American cross country skier Julia Kern trained in a gym instead of roller skiing outside.",
      "Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires around the world. As an elite athlete who relies on her lung strength to compete, Kern couldn\u2019t risk breathing in unhealthy air.",
      "\u201cPeople often just think about the winter and the snowpack,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing impacts now in our sport also while we\u2019re training in the summer.\u201d",
      "In the winter, Kern is purposefully training more often in slushy conditions because recent world championships have been warm and slushy. She has cut off the sleeves of her uniform at the start of races because it was warmer than she was acclimated to.",
      "Kern uses her platform to advocate for climate action.",
      "\u201cEveryone has a chance to change our future for the better,\u201d she said.",
      "Southern Europe, where athletes, coaches and spectators will gather in 100 days, is one of the fastest warming regions. The amount the average winter temperature has risen there since 2000 is comparable to the amount of temperature increase in the Arctic, which is \u201ceyepopping,\u201d said Judah Cohen, a visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in winter weather and forecasting.",
      "The dramatic changes in the Arctic are complicating the impact of climate change elsewhere, Cohen added. Some places are now experiencing more severe winter weather with more snow because the rapid warming in the Arctic disrupts the polar vortex, sending frigid air south.",
      "The inconsistent weather makes it more challenging to prepare athletes to compete at major events like the Olympics, said Sophie Goldschmidt, CEO of U.S. Ski & Snowboard, who added that backup plans are needed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re having to be more flexible, which ultimately costs more money to make sure that our athletes can get the right and best conditions to train on at different points in the year,\" she said. \"And that means often changing plans and moving locations.\u201d",

      "Week 8 in the NFL has been one of the most lopsided since the merger with the AFL in 1970",
      "The typical Sunday in the NFL features slates filled with tight games in the second half, back-and-forth lead changes and several comeback attempts.",
      "That's all part of the parity built into a league with a salary cap, a draft that rewards losing teams and a scheduling formula designed to give the best teams the toughest matchups.",
      "Despite all of that, the drama was missing in a Week 8 that was one of the most lopsided the NFL has seen since the merger with the AFL in 1970.",
      "The 13 games featured only one decided by single digits \u2014 a 39-38 win for the New York Jets against Cincinnati. That's the first time since the final week of the 1970 season that only one game was decided by fewer than 10 points and down dramatically from the average of 8.7 games per week decided by single digits in the first seven weeks and 8.3 per week over the last 10 seasons.",
      "Nine of the games were decided by at least 18 points, marking just the sixth time that has happened in a single week in NFL history and the first since Week 12 of the 2008 season.",
      "There were some blowouts that were somewhat expected based on the pregame betting lines like Indianapolis beating one-win Tennessee 38-14 and Tampa Bay beating one-win New Orleans 23-3.",
      "But even several matchups that figured to be tighter turned into blowouts with Minnesota losing 37-10 to the Chargers, Miami upsetting Atlanta 34-10 and Denver beating Dallas 44-24.",
      "That contributed to the average scoring margin for the week being 18.5 points per game, the highest since Week 15 of the 2012 season (18.7) and the seventh highest of any week since the merger.",
      "Only three games all week had the winning team taking the lead in the second half with the Jets rallying from 15 points down to beat the Bengals, Green Bay coming back from nine points down at the half to beat Pittsburgh 35-25 and Kansas City turning a 7-7 game at the half against Washington into a 28-7 blowout.",
      "The one true comeback was a complete surprise as the winless Jets trailed the Bengals 31-16 at the start of the fourth quarter and seemed headed to their eighth straight loss to open the season.",
      "But two TD runs by Breece Hall and another TD pass by Hall helped New York pull out a 39-38 win and end a streak of 112 straight losses in games the Jets trailed by at least 15 points. The last win came in 2003 against Miami.",
      "Headed into the 2025 season, teams had lost 135 consecutive games in the regular season and playoffs when trailing by at least 15 points at the start of the fourth quarter since Green Bay rallied from 17 down for an 18-17 win over New Orleans on Sept. 24, 2023.",
      "But four teams have engineered such comebacks already this season with Buffalo doing it in Week 1 against Baltimore, Tennessee in Week 5 against Arizona and Denver in Week 7 against the New York Giants. This is the first time that has happened at least four times in any regular season.",
      "This also marked the first time quarterback Justin Fields won a game when his team allowed at least 21 points. Fields had lost his first 26 starts in that scenario. Now Colt McCoy holds the record for most losses without a win when his team allows at least 21 points at 0-19.",
      "Indianapolis' Jonathan Taylor is off to a touchdown scoring stretch that hadn't been done for more than 75 years.",
      "Taylor ran for two scores and caught a TD pass on Sunday for the Colts, for his fourth game this season with at least three touchdowns. The last time any player did that in an entire season came in 2006 when LaDainian Tomlinson did it six times in his MVP season. The only other time a player did it in the first eight games of a season came in 1949 when Gene Roberts pulled it off for the New York Giants.",

      "His first batter was Ohtani, who reached nine times on Monday with two homers, two doubles and five walks.",
      "Bieber walked him on a full count with an outside corner changeup that could have been strike three. He struck out Ohtani in the third on a changeup at the outside corner and froze him with a knuckle curve for a called third strike in the fifth, a three-pitch at-bat that left Ohtani shaking his head.",

      "The news of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s accelerating growth in revenue and profit comes on the heels of a court ruling in the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s landmark monopoly case against Google\u2019s dominant search engine that was widely seen as a mild rebuke that wouldn\u2019t hobble the company.",
      "Alphabet performed like a powerhouse during the July-September period, delivering a profit of nearly $35 billion, or $2.87 per share, a 33% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% from last year to $102.3 billion. Both figures easily exceeded the analysts' projections that steer the stock market.",

      "That\u2019s on top of a 30% surge in Alphabet\u2019s shares that has created nearly $770 billion in stockholder wealth since early September. That\u2019s when U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected a Justice Department proposal to break up Google to curb the abuses of a search engine that was declared an illegal monopoly last year.",
      "Mehta\u2019s cautious handling of Google\u2019s search monopoly largely reflected his belief that rapid advances in artificial intelligence technology have already been spawning conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d from rising tech stars such as ChatGPT and Perplexity that are giving consumers more options.",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s creator OpenAI and Perplexity have released AI-powered web browsers to compete against Google\u2019s industry-leading Chrome browser that the Justice Department had unsuccessfully tried to persuade Mehta to order to be sold.",

In a sign of the inroads those efforts are making, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai disclosed Wednesday that Google's AI-powered Gemini app now has 650 million monthly users.",
      "Like other major tech companies, Google has been bankrolling its AI ambitions with a spending spree that has raised worries about a potential bubble that will eventually burst. Alphabet now expects to budget $91 billion to $93 billion for capital expenditures this year, up from $85 billion in its previous quarterly report issued in July, with most of the money earmarked for the massive data centers needed to power AI.",

      "The AI craze has been a boon for Google\u2019s Cloud division that oversees data centers for other companies, an endeavor that has turned into the fastest growing part of Alphabet. Google Cloud posted revenue of $15.2 billion in the past quarter, up 34% from last year.",
      "Although Google appears to have fared relatively well in the legal attack on its search engine, it still faces a potentially damaging blow in another case brought by the Justice Department against the technology underlying its ad network.",
      "After condemning parts of Google\u2019s ad technology as an illegal monopoly earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema is considering ways to handcuff the company in the future. The Justice Department is seeking a court order to force Google to sell pieces of its ad network \u2014 an issue that Brinkema isn\u2019t expected to rule on until early next year.",

After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China's ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law's January deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",
      "Trump\u2019s order was meant to enable an American-led group of investors to buy the app from China\u2019s ByteDance, though the deal also requires China\u2019s approval.",

      "A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said.

      "\u201cIf you think climate is not important, you won\u2019t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won\u2019t agree with the memo,\u201d Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who\u2019s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.\u201d",
      "Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.",

      "When pandas stepped, rolled, scratched and stumbled onto the world stage in recent decades, they quickly became symbols of modern China \u2014 in part to due to their own \u201ccuddly cuteness\u201d and deft diplomatic presentation, said Susan Brownell, a China historian at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.",
      "The original soft power couple from post-war China was a pair of giant pandas, Ping Ping and Qi Qi, sent to the Soviet Union in 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, which led to the establishment of the world\u2019s first Communist state.",
      "In 1972, a pair of pandas was sent to the U.S. for the first time, following President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic visit to Beijing. In 1984, China switched from gifting pandas to loaning them.",
      "Following outcry from animal-rights activists, China ended the practice of short-term loans and began longer leases, usually around a decade. In this arrangement through the China Wildlife Conservation Association, part of the money that an overseas zoo pays annually to China must be earmarked for habitat conservation or scientific research to benefit the species.",

      "In some of the most agriculturally rich regions in the U.S., researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand how climate change is impacting heat in rural areas and the farmworkers who toil in them",
      "In the summers, the sky is jet black when Raul Cruz arrives at this Imperial Valley sugarcane field to start his day. He chops, cleans and bundles the crop, taking heed as the sun rises. It's hard work, but so is starting at 4 a.m., even though he knows it's the safest thing when temperatures in this California desert frequently soar into the triple digits.",
      "\u201cWe just have to because we need to beat the heat,\" said Cruz, who\u2019s worked here for 15 years. They finish work by 9 or 10 a.m. to avoid the risk of heat stroke, he added, but when heat starts creeping up around 8 a.m., \"mentally, it's stressful.\"",
      "The hot climate that makes this Southern California region a farming powerhouse is also what makes it dangerous for farmworkers, who are increasingly vulnerable to rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand the health consequences of heat stress on farmworkers and where heat is most extreme in this rural landscape. They hope their findings can lead to a better understanding of rural heat islands, identify gaps in research and help develop interventions that better protect them in the face of climate change.",
      "\u201cWorkers could potentially be dying or having some serious issues,\" said project leader Nicolas Lopez-Galvez, assistant professor in the School of Public Health at SDSU. \u201cIt\u2019s better to start acting sooner.\"",
      "Since the start of the 20th century, California temperatures have increased almost 3 F (about 1.7 C), according to state and federal data. Warming has accelerated, and seven of the state\u2019s last eight years through 2024 were the warmest on record. While all areas of the state have warmed, Southern California is heating up about twice as fast as Northern California.",
      "Ana Solorio, an organizer with the farmworker advocacy group L\u00edderes Campesinas that is working with researchers, remembered feeling \u201csuffocated\u201d in the Coachella Valley summer heat when she was a farmworker. \"With the humidity, it felt awful,\" said Solorio, who's lived in the Imperial Valley for more than 30 years. The heat was so intense she didn\u2019t return for another season, preferring instead the cooler winter harvesting months of lettuce in the Imperial Valley.",
      "\u201cThis (heat) can cause a lot of harm to their health,\" she said.",
      "Researchers are trying to understand how farmworkers' heat stress might vary depending on the crops, the season and the number of breaks they take.",
      "Over the past two years, they've collected year-round data from some 300 farmworkers. Body sensors measure things like core body temperature and heart rate while they work. Elsewhere in the fields, environmental monitors measure the day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover, also known as the wet-bulb globe temperature, considered the best metric to understanding heat stress. Using satellite imagery along with historical and current wet-bulb globe temperature data, researchers are mapping areas of extreme heat, particularly in the Imperial and Coachella valleys.",
      "Researchers are learning that ground level crops can expose workers to higher heat levels compared to tree crops, for example, but it also depends on their harvesting months. In the summers, farmworkers who prepare fields for planting or help maintain irrigation systems are also more exposed.",
      "Rural heat can vary based on things like tree cover, proximity to a body of water and empty fields, which may be hotter. \u201cIt creates this island where people might be living or working that are higher in terms of heat stress compared to other places,\u201d said Lopez-Galvez.",

The county has one of the largest Latino populations and the highest number of heat-related illnesses among workers than anywhere else in the state.",

      "One study found that irrigating crop fields in the Imperial Valley reduced the wet-bulb globe temperature on summer days, thanks to the cooling effect of evaporating water. But on summer nights, the opposite occurred: irrigation increased the wet-bulb globe temperature as humidity spiked. Irrigation also heightened heat in nearby urban and fallow areas adjacent to crop fields due to moisture transport.",

      "Through this research, the authors were able to recommend how frequently farmworkers should take rest breaks to protect themselves from heat stress, based on how often wet-bulb globe temperatures exceed safety thresholds across seasons and work shifts. While California has heat rules, they're not strictly enforced, he added.",

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Friday said Meta and TitTok had breached their transparency obligations after an investigation that could result in billions of dollars in fines.",
      "The inquiry found both companies had violated the Digital Services Act, the EU\u2019s trailblazing digital rule book that imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online, including making it easier to report counterfeit or unsafe goods or flag harmful or illegal content like hate speech, as well as a ban on ads targeted at children.",

That means platforms must empower users, respect their rights, and open their systems to scrutiny. The DSA makes this a duty, not a choice.\u201d",
      "The 27-nation bloc launched investigations in 2024 into both Meta and TikTok. They found that the companies did not allow easy access to data for researchers. They also found that Meta's Instagram and Facebook did not make it easy for users to flag illegal content and effectively challenge moderation decisions. \u201cAllowing researchers access to platforms\u2019 data is an essential transparency obligation under the DSA, as it provides public scrutiny into the potential impact of platforms on our physical and mental health,\u201d according to a statement by the European Commission, the EU's executive body. The inquiry found both Facebook and Instagram deployed \u201cdark patterns\u201d or deceptive interface designs for its protocol for flagging malicious content like child sex abuse or terrorist content. That led to a kind of obfuscation, with the Commission saying it was \u201cconfusing and dissuading\u201d and \u201cmay therefore be ineffective.\u201d",

      "The administration has already ordered a review of the Smithsonian museums and exhibitions to align the institution\u2019s content with President Donald Trump\u2019s interpretation of American history.

The statues, often funded and established by Confederate heritage groups, were part of the Southern \u201cLost Cause\u201d movement that sought to romanticize the Confederacy and downplay the role of slavery as a reason for why states seceded from the Union.",
      "The statue was authorized by Congress in 1898 and then erected in 1901. It was proposed by the Freemasons, who wanted to honor him for his leadership in the society. Union veterans strongly opposed the statue but relented after being assured that Pike would be displayed in civilian clothing. The plaque recognizes Pike as an author, poet and philanthropist but does not mention his military service to the Confederacy.",
      "Northern state lawmakers and Union veterans were outraged by the trend at the time of Pike\u2019s statue being erected and countered the movement by erecting statues of Union generals and lawmakers in cities across the country\u2019s northeast and Midwest.",
      "For instance, the Washington, D.C. neighborhoods of Dupont Circle, Logan Circle and Thomas Circle near the square where Pike\u2019s statue now stands are all named after Union generals.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Alaska Supreme Court is weighing a case that is expected to determine who can provide abortion care in the state.",
      "The court heard arguments Wednesday in a 2019 case challenging the constitutionality of a law that states only a doctor licensed by the State Medical Board can perform an abortion in Alaska.",
      "The law, dating to the 1970s, was struck down as unconstitutional by Superior Court judge Josie Garton last year, a victory for the group that brought the challenge, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky. The state appealed Garton's ruling.",
      "Planned Parenthood has argued there is no medical justification for the restriction and that it unfairly burdens those seeking an abortion by limiting the pool of those qualified to provide care. In 2021, Garton granted the group\u2019s request to allow advanced practice clinicians \u2014 health care workers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants \u2014 to provide medication abortion pending her decision in the underlying case. They have continued to do so and since the 2024 ruling also have been able to provide procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood says.",
      "Advanced practice clinicians routinely provide care similar in risk and complexity to that of providing abortion services, and in 25 states can provide medication abortion, attorneys for Planned Parenthood said in court documents. Planned Parenthood's advanced practice clinicians seek to provide abortion care in just the first trimester, the attorneys said.",
      "Since Garton's 2021 decision, advanced practice clinicians have been providing \u201cnearly all\u201d medication abortions in Alaska, and Planned Parenthood clinics in the state have been able to offer medication abortion each day they've been open, the attorneys wrote. Before that, doctors hired by Planned Parenthood on a per diem basis \u2014 at the clinics on limited days \u2014 were able to offer medication abortions perhaps once or twice a week at each clinic, they wrote.",
      "A vital statistics report released by the state earlier this year shows the total number of abortions in Alaska has been fairly consistent \u2014 1,229 in 2021, 1,247 in 2022, 1,222 in 2023 and 1,224 last year.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a federal right to abortion, leaving it up to each state to regulate.",

      "Senators have taken a series of votes this week to terminate the national emergencies that Trump has used to impose tariffs. While the resolutions won't ultimately take effect, they have proven to be an effective way for Democrats to expose cracks between the president's trade policy and Republican senators who have traditionally supported free trade arguments.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democrat pushing the resolutions, said that higher prices caused by tariffs would force Republicans to break with Trump. \u201cIt will become untenable for them to just close their eyes and say, \u2018I\u2019m signing up for whatever the president wants to do,\u2019\u201d Kaine told reporters.",
      "The Senate passed a similar resolution applying to Brazilian tariffs on Tuesday, and it has already passed a resolution on Canadian imports in April.",
      "Kaine, joined by other Democrats and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has forced the votes under a decades-old law that allows Congress to block a president\u2019s emergency powers. However, House Republicans have passed new rules that allow leaders to prevent such resolutions from getting a vote in that chamber, and Trump could veto the legislation even if it did clear Congress.",
      "Wednesday's vote happened as Trump was in Asia to advance trade talks with partners there. The president has also been jousting with Canadian officials amid a delicate negotiation to reduce tariffs between the two countries.",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, acknowledged in a floor speech that many \u201cmay be nervous about what comes next\u201d as Trump remakes global trade. But he urged Congress to stay out of the way.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s truly get a balanced, fair playing field in trade,\u201d Crapo added.",

The U.S.-Canada economic relationship is one of the largest globally, totaling $909.1 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A pair of court rulings declaring some of Florida's gun restrictions unconstitutional are creating some confusion in the notoriously firearm-friendly state \u2014 and fueling activists' calls for Republican legislators to take action to update state statutes so they abide by the new legal landscape.",
      "Despite Florida's history of being a gun-supporting climate, Florida's GOP-dominated state Legislature took steps to restrict gun laws in the wake of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Since the day the measure was signed into law, gun rights advocates have been pushing to unravel it.",
      "Now, activists say recent court rulings are fueling their push to expand gun rights in the state, emboldened by U.S. Supreme Court's updated standards for evaluating gun laws based on the nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.",
      "\u201cLeaving unconstitutional laws on the books creates nothing but confusion,\u201d said Sean Caranna, executive director of the advocacy group Florida Carry.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "A ruling by a circuit court judge in Broward County, home to Fort Lauderdale, found that Florida's prohibition against people under the age of 21 from carrying a concealed firearm is unconstitutional, at least as it relates to the case in question.",
      "Last week, Judge Frank Ledee tossed out the conviction of 19-year-old Joel Walkes, who was charged with a third-degree felony for carrying a concealed handgun. Florida statutes currently allow people between the age of 18 and 20 to possess a firearm, if they legally receive it as a gift or an inheritance, but they are barred from purchasing guns or carrying them concealed.",
      "Ledee found the state's prohibition is incompatible with the Supreme Court's historical test, and inconsistent with a recent appeals court ruling that found a state law banning the open carrying of firearms is unconstitutional. In his decision, the judge pointed to the Legislature's role in codifying and clarifying the changes.",
      "\u201cDistilling these inconsistencies into a framework of firearm regulations compatible with the guarantee to bear arms pursuant to the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is best left to the wisdom of legislative debate,\" Ledee wrote.",
      "Florida's First District Court of Appeal issued its ruling last month in a case stemming from the July 4, 2022, arrest of a man who stood at a major intersection in downtown Pensacola carrying a visible, holstered pistol and a copy of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "The decision legalizes open carry, though there are preexisting limitations against carrying in a threatening manner or in certain restricted spaces like government meetings, schools and bars. The ruling has prompted some Florida sheriffs to urge caution among gun owners and seek clarity from lawmakers.",

      "Oct 26, 5:58 PM",
      "Legalizing open carry has long been a major focus of gun rights activists in the state, who oppose the slate of restrictions that Florida\u2019 lawmakers implemented in the wake of the Parkland school shooting, which killed 17 people and injured 17 others. Among the law's provisions was raising the legal gun-buying age to 21.",
      "Bob Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, said the recent court decisions put more onus on lawmakers to enact state statutes that line up with recent judicial rulings.",
      "\u201cI would not be surprised if in the next session the Florida Legislature doesn\u2019t just take care of this by amending the statute to say, \u2018clean it up.\u2019 And then that\u2019ll end all these lawsuits and possible lawsuits,\" Jarvis said of the age-related prohibition. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really now what should happen.\u201d",
      "In the years since the 2018 Parkland shooting, lawmakers' efforts to lower the gun-buying age to 18 have advanced in the Florida House but ultimately failed in the state Senate.",
      "Now some advocates say the recent court rulings should force the hand of legislators who have opposed expanding gun rights in the past.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been telling the Legislature since 2010 that this was going to be a problem for them if they didn\u2019t act. And they chose not to act,\" Caranna said.",
      "\"I hope that given some of the recent decisions from the United States Supreme Court and the Florida courts, that they will finally see that the Second Amendment is not a second-class right,\" he added.",

      "BRUSSELS -- The United States has informed its NATO allies that it will scale back its troop presence along Europe\u2019s eastern border with Ukraine as it focuses on security priorities elsewhere in the world, Romania\u2019s defense ministry said on Wednesday,",
      "Depending on operations and exercises, around 80,000-100,000 U.S. troops are usually present on European soil. NATO allies have expressed concern that the Trump administration might drastically cut their numbers and leave a security vacuum as European countries confront an increasingly aggressive Russia.",

      "It said in a statement that about 1,000 U.S. troops will remain stationed in Romania. As of April, more than 1,700 U.S. military personnel were estimated to be deployed there. A brigade usually numbers anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000 troops.",
      "Romania\u2019s Defense Minister Ionut Mosteanu said the decision reflects Washington\u2019s shift \u201ctoward the Indo-Pacific\u201d region, and that allied troop numbers would remain above the number before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine.",
      "\u201cOur strategic partnership is solid, predictable, and reliable,\u201d he said in a news conference.",
      "After the war started in 2022, NATO bolstered its presence on Europe\u2019s eastern flank by sending additional multinational battle groups to Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia. Many more European troops are now stationed there.",

      "A Pennsylvania man whose murder conviction was overturned after he served 43 years in prison hoped to walk free this month, but instead found himself in immigration custody",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- After waiting more than four decades to clear his name in a friend\u2019s 1980 killing, Subramanyam Vedam was set to walk free from a Pennsylvania prison this month.",
      "Vedam and Thomas Kinser were the 19-year-old children of Penn State University faculty. Vedam was the last person seen with Kinser and was twice convicted of killing him, despite a lack of witnesses or motive.",
      "In August, a judge threw out the conviction after Vedam's lawyers found new ballistics evidence that prosecutors had never disclosed.",
      "As his sister prepared to bring him home on Oct. 3, the thin, white-haired Vedam was instead taken into federal custody over a 1999 deportation order. The 64-year-old, who legally came to the U.S. from India when he was 9 months old, now faces another daunting legal fight.",
      "Amid the Trump Administration's focus on mass deportation, Vedam's lawyers must persuade an immigration court that a 1980s drug conviction should be outweighed by the years he wrongly spent in prison. For a time, immigration law allowed people who had reformed their lives to seek such waivers. Vedam never pursued it then because of the murder conviction.",
      "\u201cHe was someone who\u2019s suffered a profound injustice,\u201d said immigration lawyer Ava Benach. \u201c(And) those 43 years aren\u2019t a blank slate. He lived a remarkable experience in prison.\u201d",
      "Vedam earned several degrees behind bars, tutored hundreds of fellow inmates and went nearly half a century with just a single infraction, involving rice brought in from the outside.",
      "His lawyers hope immigration judges will consider the totality of his case. The administration, in a brief filed Friday, opposes the effort. So Vedam remains at an 1,800-bed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in central Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cCriminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S,\" a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in an email about the case.",
      "After his initial conviction was thrown out, Vedam faced an unusual set of questions at his 1988 retrial.",
      "\u201cMr. Vedam, where were you born?\u201d Centre County District Attorney Ray Gricar asked. \u201cHow frequently would you go back to India?",
      "\u201cDuring your teenage years, did you ever get into meditation?\u201d",
      "Gopal Balachandran, the Penn State law professor who won the reversal, believes the questions were designed to alienate him from the all-white jury, which returned a second guilty verdict.",
      "The Vedams were among the first Indian families in the area known as \u201cHappy Valley,\u201d where his father had come as a postdoctoral fellow in 1956. An older daughter was born in State College, but \u201cSubu,\u201d as he was known, was born when the family was back in India in 1961.",

      "One day in December 1980, Vedem asked Kinser for a ride to nearby Lewisburg to buy drugs. Kinser was never seen again, although his van was found outside his apartment. Nine months later, hikers found his body in a wooded area miles away.",
      "Vedam was detained on drug charges while police investigated, and was ultimately charged with murder. He was convicted in 1983 and sentenced to life without parole. To resolve the drug case, he pleaded no contest to four counts of selling LSD and a theft charge. The 1988 retrial offered no reprieve from his situation.",
      "Although the defense long questioned the ballistics evidence in the case, the jury, which heard that Vedam had bought a .25-caliber gun from someone, never heard that an FBI report suggested the bullet wound was too small to have been fired from that gun. Balachandran only found that report as he dug into the case in 2023.",
      "After hearings on the issue, a Centre County judge threw out the conviction and the district attorney decided this month not to retry the case.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- A federal trial over whether President Donald Trump can deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, is set to begin Wednesday, with local police officials expected to testify that federal agents at the city\u2019s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building have inflamed protests in recent weeks through excessive force.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, will preside over the trial in Portland. The trial stems from a lawsuit filed by the city and state against the Trump administration in a bid to block the troop deployment.",
      "Immergut has already issued two temporary restraining orders in the case blocking the troops pending further litigation. She found that Trump had failed to show that he had met the conditions set out by Congress for using the military domestically. She described his assessment of the situation in Portland, which Trump called \u201cwar ravaged,\u201d as \u201csimply untethered to the facts.\u201d",
      "One of Immergut's orders was paused last week by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the case before an 11-judge panel.",
      "The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement \u2014 including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue \u2014 seek to push back. They argue the president has not met the legal requirements to deploy troops and that doing so would violate states\u2019 sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because protests have impeded law enforcement operations.",
      "Portland\u2019s ICE building outside downtown has been the site of nightly protests that peaked in June when police declared one demonstration a riot. Smaller clashes have also occurred since then, and federal officers have fired tear gas to clear crowds, which at times have included counterprotesters and live-streamers.",
      "During the trial, witnesses are expected to take the stand for both sides and face cross-examination. The federal defendants will call officials from ICE, the Defense Department and the Federal Protective Service, the agency that provides security for federal buildings.",
      "The administration argues that it has had to shuffle Department of Homeland Security agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the protests, showing that it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces \u2014 one of the conditions set by Congress for calling out the National Guard. It has also characterized the protests as a \u201crebellion\" or \u201cdanger of rebellion\u201d \u2014 another of the conditions.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s deployment of the nation\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier to South America is pulling the ship out of the Mediterranean Sea",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's decision to shift the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier to South America in his campaign against drug cartels is pulling the ship out of the Mediterranean Sea at a time when a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been threatened by new strikes in Gaza.",
      "The U.S. is set to be in the fairly unusual position of having only a single aircraft carrier deployed and none in the waters off both Europe and the Middle East. The change is especially stark after the U.S. joined Israeli strikes on Iran in June and has engaged in some of the most intense combat operations since World War II against Yemen's Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.",
      "Aircraft carriers, with their thousands of sailors and dozens of warplanes, have long been recognized as one of the ultimate signifiers of U.S. military might and the nation's foreign policy priorities. There have been five carrier deployments to the Middle East since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, including two carriers in the region at multiple points this year and last.",
      "The new orders for the USS Gerald R. Ford illustrate the Trump administration\u2019s increasing focus on the Western Hemisphere and mark a major escalation of firepower as the U.S. military ramps up fatal strikes on alleged drug boats. With a buildup of warships, aircraft and troops already in the region, Trump himself has signaled what could be next.",
      "Speaking from another aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, in its home port of Japan, Trump noted the U.S. attacks at sea and reiterated that \"now we\u2019ll stop the drugs coming in by land.\u201d",
      "Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a retired Marine colonel, questioned how long the Ford would be able to remain in South America, when only three of the 11 U.S. aircraft carriers are typically out to sea.",
      "\u201cIt's such a powerful and scarce resource, there will be a lot of pressure to do something or send it elsewhere,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cYou can imagine the peace negotiations breaking down in the eastern Mediterranean or something happening with Iran.\u201d",
      "The USS Nimitz also is deployed but is heading home from the South China Sea to the West Coast before being decommissioned. It recently lost two aircraft \u2014 a fighter jet and a helicopter \u2014 in separate crashes that are under investigation. A third carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, is not deployed but is conducting exercises off the coast of San Diego.",
      "The shift is happening just as violence has flared up again in Gaza despite a ceasefire that Trump helped broker after two years of war. The Israeli army launched a barrage of attacks Tuesday as tensions with Hamas grew two weeks into the fragile ceasefire.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. military's growing presence near Venezuela and its 13 fatal strikes on alleged drug boats have stoked fears that Trump could try to topple authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.",
      "In response to questions about the speculation, Secretary of State Marco Rubio insisted Saturday that the U.S. is taking part in a counterdrug operation. And he again accused Maduro\u2019s government of participating in the shipment of narcotics.",
      "\u201cThis is a very serious problem for the hemisphere, and a very destabilizing one,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd that has to be addressed.\u201d",

His proposal calls for a 90,000-square-foot structure, almost twice the size of the 55,000-square-foot White House itself and able to accommodate 1,000 people. The plan also includes building a more modern East Wing, officials have said.",

Just shy of the 120-day mark, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed him as First Assistant U.S. Attorney and said he would have the authority to serve as acting U.S. attorney upon a vacancy in the role. He then resigned as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "The government has argued that he can do so under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, which Congress passed specifically to regulate the temporary filling of executive branch vacancies that require presidential appointment and Senate confirmation.",
      "Seabright, however, said that provision of the law only applies if the previous U.S. Attorney dies, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated.",
      "The lawsuit seeking to disqualify Essayli was brought by three men facing federal firearms charges. They sought to have their indictments dismissed. Seabright ruled the indictments can proceed.",
      "In Nevada, the same judge that disqualified Chattah ruled last week that he was pausing his earlier ruling while a federal appellate court weighed an appeal from the U.S. Department of Justice, allowing her to remain temporarily involved in the cases being prosecuted by her office.

      "KINGSTON N.Y. -- A former New York state trooper was accused in court Tuesday of using his patrol car as a battering ram in a high-speed pursuit that killed an 11-year-old girl, a case one prosecutor called a \u201cfatal abuse of power.\u201d",
      "Christopher Baldner faces multiple charges for his actions on the night of Dec. 22, 2020, after he pulled over a Dodge Journey driven by Tristin Goods for speeding. Goods was driving north on the New York State Thruway with his wife and two daughters for a holiday with family.",
      "The trooper and the driver argued, and Baldner pepper-sprayed the inside of the vehicle. Goods drove off and Baldner pursued at speeds as high as 130 mph, twice ramming the SUV, causing it to lose control and flip over after the second impact, according to prosecutors.",
      "\u201cHe used his patrol car as a weapon and rammed into the back of the Goods\u2019 family car, not once, but twice,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Gashi told a jury in her opening statement.",
      "Eleven-year-old Monica Goods was found dead inside the vehicle.",
      "Gashi said Baldner's actions that night were deliberate, willful and depraved. The case was not about a tragic accident, but a \"fatal abuse of power,\u201d she said.",
      "Baldner was indicted in October 2021 on charges of murder, second-degree manslaughter and first-degree reckless endangerment. Three of the six endangerment charges stem from a separate 2019 case on the Thruway in which he is accused ramming the back of a Dodge Caravan with three people aboard, causing the vehicle to crash into a guard rail.",
      "A defense attorney told the jury the prosecution was trying to \u201cdemonize\u201d Baldner, who was dealing with a belligerent and uncooperative driver.",

      "Actress June Lockhart (June 25, 1925-Oct 23, 2025) was best known for roles in two popular TV series: as Ruth Martin in \"Lassie,\" and as Maureen Robinson, matriarch of a family that was \"Lost in Space.\"",
      "The daughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, June appeared on stage in New York beginning at age 6. After her parents moved to Hollywood, she made her unbilled film debut at age 13 alongside Gene and Kathleen, who played Bob Cratchit and his wife, in 1938's \"A Christmas Carol.\" June's first credit was in the Bette Davis drama \"All This, and Heaven Too.\" \u00a0She appeared in \"Sergeant York,\" \"The White Cliffs of Dover,\" \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" and \"She-Wolf of London,\" and won a Tony Award for the 1947 comedy \"For Love or Money.\" But her starring role in 1945's \"Son of Lassie\" (as the adult version of the character played by Elizabeth Taylor in the original) foreshadowed what would become her most familiar role.",
      "In 1958, Lockhart joined the TV series \"Lassie\" as Ruth Martin (taking over the role played by Cloris Leachman). For six years, in more than 200 episodes, Lockhart dispensed motherly wisdom to young Timmy (Jon Provost), who would engage in less-than-proper behavior or find himself in danger (but never, as the trope suggested, fallen down a well), only to be rescued by his faithful collie.",
      "And she knew who the star of the show was. \"Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it,\" she told The New York Times in 2004.",
      "The show, which aired on CBS, featured scripts that were in some cases written by blacklisted writers. \"When people come up to me and say, 'Well, sure wish we had wonderful American shows like that the way we used to in the 50's,' I say, 'Let me tell you who wrote those scripts Yes, they were good Americans, and they were in jail,'\" she said.",
      "Beginning in 1965, Lockhart starred in the frequently campy science fiction series \"Lost in Space.\" For three seasons, the Robinson Family \u2013 crewmembers aboard the doomed Jupiter II spacecraft \u2013 were marooned, or attacked by monsters and evil aliens (and in one notorious incident, a talking carrot), all while dealing with typical family drama. \"It was really endearing. 'Lost in Space' was like going out in the backyard in the sand and playing space. We did have fun,\" she said at a 2010 public appearance. She was also a NASA spokesperson, and attended space shuttle launches.",
      "In 1968, she joined the cast of \"Petticoat Junction\" for the sitcom's last two seasons. She also appeared on \"General Hospital,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"Ellery Queen,\" \"Quincy, M.E.,\" \"Vega$,\" \"Magnum, P.I.,\" \"Knots Landing,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Full House,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and \"Cold Case.\" She provided the voice of Alpha Control in the 2021 Netflix reboot of \"Lost in Space.\" She also starred in touring productions of \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Bedroom Farce\" and \"Once More with Feeling.\"",
      "In the 1950s, while appearing as a panelist on the Fred Friendly-produced game show \"Who Said That?,\" Lockhart met White House press correspondents. A self-described \"news junkie,\" she later traveled with them while they covered the 1956 presidential campaigns. When she filled in for the host of a TV talk show, she used her connections to interview President Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty. As thanks, Hagerty gave Lockhart a lifetime press pass. She used it for decades to attend White House briefings whenever she was in Washington."

      "You may have to worry about wind and rain and heat, but you rarely have to worry about anyone else. You do it by yourself, which gives you control. You don't need to travel to a gym or a field; you just need to open your front door. The sport's simplicity means your successes are your own, and also that there's no one else to blame when you fail. And no sport shows the relentless decline of the aging body more clearly than running. If you can't do what you did a year or a month ago, the evidence is right there on your watch.",
      "Sometimes, I use running as a form of meditation. I put on my shoes and go out. I connect my watch to satellites and then try to disconnect my mind from the swirl inside. Eventually, I'm alone in my head. Sometimes, I'll focus on a musical mantra: \"one-two-three, one-two-three,\" tracking my steps and making sure I keep my left and right feet alternating symmetrically on the downbeat. Other times, I focus on my breath or on the sounds and motion around me, whether the blue jays in the Catskills or the trucks rumbling by on Broadway. Sometimes, as with all meditation, my attention wanders, like a stream flowing haphazardly through my mind, collecting sticks and carrying them until they wash to the side.",
      "When I run a workout, though, everything changes. I'm not trying to open my mind; I'm trying to close it. I shut out the blue jays and the trucks. I have to focus. If I'm with a training partner, I lock my attention on their shoulder if I'm behind or on their breath if I'm ahead. Usually, though, I'm on my own. I look for runners up the road and set imaginary races against them: Can I catch the lady in the purple sweatshirt before the second oak tree? Can I stay an even twenty meters behind the cyclist playing John Coltrane on a boom box? I check my watch and try not to let my pace deviate from the goal. I try to identify the parts of my body that hurt and then I push the pain away from them. I remind myself that I have run this fast before. Self-doubt is a smoldering fire. In a workout, the embers often flash. I don't want to give them any air. Every action we take helps to build our habits. Quit once and it'll be easier to quit the second time too.",
      "I don't listen to music while I run. Every workout is a physical challenge \u2014 I'm trying to strengthen the muscles in my legs and my heart \u2014 but it's also a mental challenge. I'm trying to teach my body how to move quickly and with good coordination through space. Running is a process of learning about your body and developing habits deep inside it. Music can confuse the signals. I want to deepen my understanding of the relationship between my stride, my pace, my breath. I don't want a bassline, or the adrenaline that can flow with it, to get in the way.",
      "When I race in a marathon, my goal early on is to spend as little energy as possible thinking about anything extraneous. I think about posture and form and balance. I try not to think about the people cheering. I try not to think about past fail\u00adures or successes. I try to glance as infrequently as possible at my watch. It takes energy, after all, to turn your head, and it takes energy to think. When people in my pack ask questions, or offer commentary, I respond in grunts. On easy runs with friends in the park, I'm a chatterbox. When I race, I'm a vault.",
      "Over the years, the sport has shifted my imagination and my sense of self. When I travel by train, I find myself looking out the window and noting spots to run by the creeks and forests nearby. When I arrive in a new city, I like to circle it with a run. I've seen more of the world while running than I have while walking. I have recurring dreams of mountains I've run up. But I spend much of the day at a desk, mind-wired to my to-do list. Running is my one connection to na\u00adture and to a younger, adventurous self who only and always wanted to be outside.",

      "Over the past three decades, Kenny Chesney has been one of the most celebrated singers in music. In his first book, \"Heart Life Music\" (written with journalist Holly Gleason, to be published Tuesday by William Morrow), Chesney recounts his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which he writes about a soulful collaboration with singer-songwriter Grace Potter \u2013 and don't miss Lee Cowan's interview with Kenny Chesney on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 26!",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Grace",
      "There was a show on tv called \"Let's Make A Deal.\" People would be contestants, hoping host Monty Hall would pick them to compete for prizes. New cars, new kitchens with all the appliances, expensive watches. You had to pick.",
      "",
      "One of two things: color tvs and washer/dryer sets, or what was behind Door No. 3, knowing it could be a wheelbarrow with some grass seed, or a new car.",
      "I've always been attracted to what's behind Door No. 3. That idea of the big unknown you can't see always appealed to me. The seeker inside has chased the unknown all my life.",
      "When you're a dreamer, you can't not take Door No. 3. That mentality fuels you. Seeking inspiration, wanting to find out has risk involved. Some Door No. 3s don't work out. But Grace Potter? She's the epitome of why Door No. 3 is always better than playing it safe.",
      "\"You & Tequila\" showed up in my email in the middle of the night.",
      "I remember listening, thinking, \"Damn\u2026,\"",
      "That idea of a person you can't quit, because they're so addictive is real. You can't resist, only overdo it to the point of poisoning yourself hit me. I called Matraca Berg, asked if there was a demo with a man singing it; she had one. Hearing Tim Krekel sing it hit me even harder.",
      "We cut it really simple. That pull between what you want and knowing you shouldn't made \"You & Tequila\" burn into people.",
      "We were about done with Hemingway's Whiskey. I wanted something to make it shine. Buddy Cannon and I were talking about who might sound good; Clint Higham, my co-manager, even reached out to Irving Azoff about the Eagles, since this sounded like a classic Laurel Canyon song.",
      "Then the woman who sent me the demo asked, \"Why don't you get Grace Potter? She captures that haunted and haunting feeling.\"",
      "What makes Grace Potter, the ultimate Door No. 3, was the mystery. The hippie songwriter/rock girl.",
      "Once she was suggested, as much as it made no sense on paper, I knew she was the person we needed.",
      "I listen to a lot of music at night in the Virgin Islands. No light pollution, you can drift in the sounds. I'd been given Grace's live CD. \"Apologies\" poured out of the speakers.",
      "Motionless on a chaise lounge, when I heard Grace's voice \u2013 so soulful, but beautiful and real \u2013 I was floored. Nobody in my life had heard this voice except my friend. I felt blessed.",
      "She wrote her own songs. She had a band, wasn't overproduced. Really listening, it was how she played that B-3 organ, but especially how she sang those songs.",
      "I looked up at the sky and exhaled. She sounded like coming home.",
      "When we put her on \"You & Tequila,\" all she knew about me was \"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\" because the Eagle in Burlington, Vermont had played it to death.",
      "Was it even possible? Grace had finished a European tour, traveled 24 hours with no sleep and was landing in America. We laugh now, but she listened to the demo on the rental car shuttle having cleared customs.",
      "She was tired. She missed her family. And we needed her in Nashville within 48 hours to make the deadline for mastering \u2013 or we'd have to move the record. Her manager wasn't optimistic. My friend insisted, \"Give her the song.\"",
      "",
      "Thirty minutes later, we had a yes. Thirty hours later, Grace Potter landed in Nashville in a flowy leopard print dress, walked into Blackbird Recording Studios and changed both of our lives. Brash, smart and funny, she oozed music. She told wild stories, made some people blush and asked us what we were thinking.",
      "Buddy suggested, \"Get in the booth and put your headphones on. See how it feels to you.\"",
      "Probably warming up, she was humming. Then that \"ooooohOOOOOHohhhh\" she does on the record rolled out.",
      "\"Do some more of that.\"",
      "Two or three takes later, we were done. We'd talked longer than she was in the vocal booth. Even before it was mixed, we knew it was something. That's the thing: you know.",
      "It was my birthday. I asked her and her boyfriend if they'd like to have dinner. We went to Sunset Grille, sat outside on the patio and laughed. We came from musically different places; her country music was Willie, Townes Van Zandt and Lucinda Williams. But we were of the same heart, same small town, family-oriented life.",
      "She was tired, so we didn't hang long. When I got up to leave, she followed me, jumped in the passenger seat of my car, and announced, \"I don't know what the future holds, but we're going to be friends for life.\"",
      "Grace Potter knew things. I've always believed there are things in our lives that were pre-determined; set into motion by some larger power. Grace was absolutely one.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:24:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic and author of \"The Running Ground,\" talks about how his father inspired him to become a world-class long-distance runner.",
    "story": [
      "One of the first things you realize about Nick Thompson is just how busy he is, as CEO of The Atlantic; as a public speaker; and on top of it all, as a family man. But he is also a world-class long-distance runner.",
      "He ran to the office on the day we talked. \"I did, of course,\" he said.",
      "\"Why do you like it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Every time I go running, I'm opening my mind up, I'm engaging with nature,\" he said. \"I have a chance to think. I like to have my body in motion. It's a break from the rest of life. It's something I've always loved.\"",
      "And if you can imagine, Thompson has actually gotten faster as he's gotten older, shaving 14 minutes off his best marathon time at 44 \u2013 and just this year, posting the fastest 50-mile time in the world for his age group.",
      "If you're wondering how he does it, and why, he explains in \"The Running Ground\" \u2013 part memoir, part call to the runner in all of us.",
      "\"Everybody can run,\" he said. \"Go to Prospect Park, right, and look at the incredible, beautiful variety. Short people, tall people, really skinny people, wide people. Everybody can run. Humans were made to run.\"",
      "Thompson says he started running because his father was a runner. \"There was always energy and chaos and life around him,\" he said. \"He never slowed down, he never stopped.\"",
      "But in a life of great professional success \u2013 teaching and working in both the Ford and Reagan administrations \u2013 Scott Thompson also suffered personal turmoil.",
      "Thompson writes that one of his father's refrains was to tell him that his life is going to crack apart when he turns 40. \"He told me that all the time,\" he said. \"You know, his father, his life had gotten much harder and kind of fallen apart at 40. And then my dad felt that his life had kind of fallen apart at 40.\"",
      "Scott left the family when Nick was just a kid, and then struggled with just about everything. \"He was an alcoholic and he was a sex addict,\" said Thompson. \"But he wasn't a mean drunk, a fall-over drunk. He just drank way too much. And then in his later life, after he came out of the closet \u2013 in his 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s \u2013 he had a terrible problem with sex addiction.\"",
      "For Nick, running became both a way to be like his father, while also rejecting the chaos that followed him. \"In some ways, running is a way of mourning him after he passed away,\" he said. \"I also am well aware that he could not control his emotions. He could not control what he did during the course of a day. I felt like one of the ways I could prevent that from happening to me was to run, that running gave me discipline through the rest of my life.\"",
      "So, Thompson ran. He ran in high school, and briefly in college at Stanford. And after a break, he picked it up again in his late 20s, which is when he got the news: \"I had just run my first really good marathon and felt on top of the world. And it's two weeks later, the next week I go in and see the doctor and he is like, 'I feel something.'\"",
      "It turned out to be thyroid cancer. \"I was diagnosed when I was 30 years old and it was just a shock,\" he said.",
      "Shocking as it was, it was treatable, and it gave Thompson a new goal. He said, \"One of the reasons I kept marathoning in my 30s and in my 40s was because I wanted to feel like the person I had been before I got sick.\"",
      "As he got faster, his career took off, too. He joined Cond\u00e9 Nast, where he would eventually become editor of newyorker.com and editor-in-chief of Wired. Longtime viewers of \"Sunday Morning\" may remember he even reported for this show, in stories on QAnon, the 2020 election, and Wikipedia.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think you'd be where you are professionally without running?\"",
      "\"Definitely not,\" he replied. \"I think running has been a great tool professionally. It is a way for me to add discipline to my days, for me to have time where my mind can just wander, where I can think through things.\"",
      "But for Thompson, now 50, what's really unexpected is what happened next. He is faster today than he was at age 35. \"I like to think of it as the aging process as a moving sidewalk, you know, pushing you backwards, right? Like, every year I get a little bit weaker. But you can do things to kind of move forward faster than the moving sidewalk is going backwards. You can figure out how to train more intelligently. You can get a better understanding of your body. You can eat differently.\"",
      "Which is not to say that's it's easy.",
      "I asked, \"If you're trying to encourage people to run, why do you post from time to time pictures of yourself looking in absolute agony? Like crossing a finish line? I mean, terrible photos. Some of the all-time worst anyone's ever put out in public voluntarily!\"",
      "\"So, that race was really hard,\" he said. \"It was the Lake Waramaug 50-miler, and I wanted to set the American record for my age group. And I was on pace through 45, 46 miles. And then the last few miles, I knew I was gonna be close, and so I was pushing so hard. I was just \u2026 hurting so much everywhere. But I still won the race. I still ran the fastest time in the world this year. It was still like a pretty good result.\"",
      "Running continues to be a family tradition for the Thompsons. Nick runs with his own three sons, and coaches weekly track sessions with his youngest son's soccer team. He said, \"It feels like full circle to have learned the sport from my father when I was about 5 or 6, and now being able to pass it to my children \u2013 James is 11, Zachary's 15, Ellis is 17. It's a great thing. And there's all these other kids!\"",
      "And as it turns out, life hasn't fallen apart like his father warned.",
      "\"You've kind of done it!\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I mean, I keep going because I enjoy it, right?\" Thompson laughed. \"I keep running because, you know, my life didn't fall apart at 40 'cause I didn't lose my discipline at 40, but could still fall apart at 50, which I just turned. And so, I don't wanna let it go. The really interesting transition in my life will be at some point I won't be able to do this, and then I'll have to figure out how else to hold on.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:14:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The Oscar-winning director is adding his spin to the mythic tale of a scientist creating a man from body parts. He talks about his lifelong fascination with Mary Shelley's story, and how \"in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
    "story": [
      "Director Guillermo del Toro (\"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"The Shape of Water\") hovered over a model representing the creature in his latest film, \"Frankenstein.\" \"We made, I think, the most extensive, minute, anatomical putting together of the monster in the history of cinema,\" he said.",
      "He considered every tendon, every suture, every organ, and admits for some that can be a bit much. \"Sorry about breakfast!\" he laughed.",
      "But to bring Victor Frankenstein's monster to life in cinema, the filmmaker first was playing creator himself. Del Toro, who resurrected \"Frankenstein\" for Netflix as writer, producer and director, took \"Sunday Morning\" around a London exhibition detailing his elaborate vision for the gothic classic \u2013 from wardrobe and props, to his extensive notes, which he spent years writing.",
      "There is also, in a glass case, the original text, inscribed from Mary Shelley to Lord Byron. \"This is the one I would steal,\" he joked. \"I would do a full Pink Panther.\"",
      "The groundbreaking novel about a scientist who creates a living, feeling being mixes horror, romance, and humanity. It was penned by Mary Shelley, who finished it when she was just 19, more than 200 years ago.",
      "So, why does her story endure? \"Well, first of all, it was written by a teenager that was full of questions and rage and rebellion,\" del Toro said. \"You know, it's the same questions we have now: What are we? Why am I human? Why am I here?\"",
      "Is it a coincidence that the film comes out around Halloween? \"No! No!\" he said. \"To me, Halloween is all year long.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\" I asked.",
      "\"I live a house that has secret passages. I live in a house that is inhabited full of monsters,\" he said.",
      "\"In your mind?\"",
      "\"No, I built it! When I was forty-something, I invested everything I had into creating the house I wanted when I was 7.\"",
      "\"Well, no wonder you wanted to make 'Frankenstein'!\"",
      "\"I have a room dedicated to 'Frankenstein.' I call it the living room.\"",
      "And what does he do in that room? \"I say hello to all the figures in the morning, I write, I investigate, I design.\"",
      "He started experiencing life through literature, he says, growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico. But for him, \"Frankenstein\" was not just any story he'd read. \"You really wanted to make this film,\" I said.",
      "\"I gave it over 50 years of my life, so yes,\" del Toro said. \"It's in all of my movies. All 13 movies have elements   of the film. 'Pinocchio' is another prodigal father asking for forgiveness of his child. My first movie, 'Cronus,' deals with eternal life. 'Shape of Water,' certainly, the idea of the monster being of the same essence than the main female character, and the female character recognizing herself in it.\"",
      "\"We are all creatures,\" he said. \"I mean, we have a world that tells you you shouldn't be a creature, but in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
      "And in what ways is del Toro weird? \"I was this strange, pale creature that liked to read, and I was a hypochondriac at age seven. I thought I had trichinosis. I thought have cirrhosis. And I studied medical manuals, and I would go to my mom and say, 'I think I have a terminal cancer.' So I was a weird, weird kid.\"",
      "And for del Toro, there is an appeal to monsters: \"Monsters tell you, look, it's okay to be you. It's okay to be imperfect.\"",

      "\"Boris Karloff, Godzilla, the Creature from the Black Lagoon! What is beautiful about monsters is they become patron saints of imperfection.\"",
      "Boris Karloff's 1931 portrayal of Mary Shelley's monster is film history. In del Toro's reimagination, Oscar Isaac is Victor Frankenstein, birthing a creature played by Jacob Elordi.",
      "\"Every day there was some new, beautiful, strange thing waiting for me to try and do,\" said Isaac. \"To be invited to do these kinds of things as a performer, it was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.\"",
      "Asked what he did to become the creature, Elordi replied, \"I don't know if that will really fit into a news bit. I couldn't tell you. It's this elusive thing. Guillermo and I shared a language together immediately. I was, like, fully creatively ready to play something like that.\"",
      "Asked why he picked Isaac and Elordi for the roles, del Toro replied, \"Eyes. I cast the eyes.\"",
      "I asked, \"What do you see in their eyes?\"",
      "\"Oscar had brilliance, madness, seduction and pain. And Jacob was completely open. He had an innocence and an openness and a purity in his eyes that was completely disarming.\"",
      "And did the filmmaker want his monster to be beautiful? \"Oh yeah. 100%, it has to look like something newly minted,\" he said. \"Not like a repair job in an ICU.\"",
      "\"But, there's also a handsomeness, a sexiness to Jacob as the creature,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I was raised Catholic, and a lot of those crucifixions in Mexico have the loin cloth a little too low!\"",
      "\"Were you thinking about that?\"",
      "\"No,\" del Toro said, \"but my grandma certainly was!\"",
      "Del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" is rich with Catholic imagery, and inspired by all the monsters he grew up with \u2013 fuelling his lifelong cinematic mission.",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel any connection to the Frankensteins of the past?\"",
      "\"To the myth,\" he replied. \"I mean, my first crush was Mary Shelley. I truly can tell you this, you are born to sing one or two songs in your lifetime. This is my song.\"",
      "\"So, what do you do now? \"",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" del Toro replied. \"Macrame? Pottery?\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:10:19 -0400",
    "summary": "He's one of country music's most celebrated singers. But Kenny Chesney's latest work is a book, \"Heart Life Music,\" in which he describes his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
    "story": [
      "Just as the sun was going down in the heart of old Key West, Florida, a self-described pirate rode his rust-ravaged bike to the Blue Heaven restaurant to meet a friend \u2013 a friend we just happened to be in the middle of interviewing. \"She said come in!\" David Wegman laughed, as he joined Kenny Chesney.",
      "But that's the thing about Chesney \u2013 down here, he's not really a country music superstar. He's just another laid-back local. \"We know a lot of the same people,\" Chesney laughed.",
      "He collects characters like seashells \u2013 he met Wegman at Ivan's Stress-Free Bar down in the British Virgin Islands. \"Above the bar was written in shells: 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem,'\" Wegman recalled.",
      "That 2002 song, \"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,\" helped make Chesney one of the biggest touring acts around. Almost every summer he turns stadiums into beach parties. Among his many accolades: the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year Award, which he won four years in a row. And just last week, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame \u2013 a career-topping accomplishment that he credits to taking that tropical turn in his career.",
      "\"You know what's crazy?\" he said. \"I had an 18-song Greatest Hits album, and nobody knew who I was. They knew the songs, but I wasn't comfortable in my skin yet. I didn't know who I was supposed to be as an artist yet. I would go do shows and they would go, 'Oh yeah, that's the guy that sings that song.' And then, 'That's the guy that sings that song.' When I started being my true, authentic self, that's when everything changed.\"",
      "He could have taken us to some Tiki bar down in the Keys to keep up his tropical brand. But instead, he wanted to show us the room where Ernest Hemingway worked on \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Green Hills of Africa.\"",
      "I said, \"The space, it's almost like sacred place.\"",
      "\"Yeah, do you feel it? I feel it,\" Chesney said. \"I spent so much, almost two weeks straight on the bow of my boat in the Virgin Islands reading those books.\"",
      "Which might explain why he came down here to work on his first book, out next month: \"Heart Life Music.\" \"This book forced me to pause,\" he said.",
      "For all of his love of the islands, he writes it was his own mom who first realized that he may have drifted too far from his East Tennessee roots. \"She wanted her 12-year-old boy back in ways, and he was gone. Gone gone gone,\" he said.",
      "\"She had a hard time finding you, kind of had a hard time reaching you?\" I asked.",
      "\"It hit me a little bit, but I was so already so addicted to seeking an adventure and all of it, and all these new things happening in my life that I dismissed it.\"",
      "He kept going, kept touring, kept writing, until a concert in Indianapolis back in 2009, which he describes as hitting a wall, and crying on stage. \"In that moment I was so exhausted and numb to all of it, that it wasn't making me happy,\" he said. \"I wasn't creating the same way.\u00a0 I wasn't connecting to the audience. It just hit me.\u00a0 It took sports to get me out of that funk.\"",
      "He grew up playing baseball and football \u2013 loving every inning, every down. So, when a song called \"The Boys of Fall\" crossed his path, he didn't only record it; he began interviewing coaches and players about sports and life, and turned it into a documentary for ESPN, \"Boys of Fall.\" \"I needed Joe Namath, I needed Bill Parcells,\" he said. \"I sat in Bobby Bowden's living room and he talked to me like a deacon in a Baptist church! I woke up one day, and I went, I'm back.\"",
      "Now he's the one doing pre-game pep talks backstage, like at Sphere in Las Vegas. Many on his team have been with him for decades. There's confidence in familiarity. \"If I had to sit on the bus and think about what I'm getting ready to go do, it would \u2013 yeah, I don't do well with that,\" he said.",
      "He put on the kind of show his fans expect \u2013 a kaleidoscope of sand, sunsets and songs.",
      "When me met him the next morning, he was still buzzing about performing in Sphere. \"The first couple of nights, I caught myself singing a song and I was like, Well, this is so cool! \u00a0And then, I forgot the words to a song that I actually wrote!\"",
      "On stage with him this night was Grace Potter, the singer-songwriter he recruited for a duet, even though country really wasn't her thing. The two are now lifelong friends.",
      "\"There's people who have always seen him as just the iconic, you know, Statue of David of country music,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm gonna go to Florence and stand beside it!\" he laughed.",
      "\"But there's just so much more underneath it that's more interesting than the sculpture itself,\" Potter added.",
      "Indeed, the off-stage Kenny Chesney is a more complicated guy, a more thoughtful guy, even a little shy if you can believe it. That's the East Tennessee part that will always remain even as he's chasing sunsets.",
      "Chesney said, \"It takes a certain amount of ego to be up there on stage and to do what I do, right? But I try really hard to leave that person up there. I can't live that person every day. And I don't want that person in my life every day, but I'm really glad to meet him when I go back up there.\"",

    "summary": "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and appeared to blame stress. Doctors say stress isn't usually a direct cause, but can influence risk factors.",
    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in a teaser for the new season of her family's reality TV show, \"The Kardashians.\" She appears to blame the diagnosis on stress \u2014 but doctors say that usually isn't a direct cause.",
      "In the clip shared Thursday, Kardashian, 45, is seen going in for an MRI scan and telling her family, \"There was a little aneurysm.\" She then appears to say she was told the cause was \"just stress.\" Footage from the teaser also features a sometimes emotional Kardashian talking about her difficult divorce with ex-husband Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.",
      "While stress itself doesn't create an aneurysm, it can raise blood pressure, which is related to aneurysm formation and growth, said Dr. Brian Snelling, director of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery and director of the stroke program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.",
      "\"The real culprits are genetics, elevated blood pressure, smoking and age-related changes in the arteries,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"It is not proven that stress alone causes an aneurysm,\" said Dr. Greg Albers, co-founder of health platform RapidAI and director of the Stanford Stroke Center, but adds stress can over time cause an increase in blood pressure which can make an individual more vulnerable to one.",
      "A brain aneurysm is a \"bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain,\" the\u00a0Mayo Clinic explains.",
      "You can think of it as a weak spot in the artery \u2014 imagine a garden hose that has one spot where the rubber's thin like balloon, instead of thick, said Dr. Adam Arthur, neurosurgeon and a chief medical officer at Medtronic, a medical device company.",
      "\"Over time, with pressure going through that hose, it's caused a little sack,\" he explained.",
      "Brain aneurysms, which tend to be more prevalent in women, aren't uncommon: \"Around 1 in 50 adults have a brain aneurysm,\" Snelling said. But, most people never know they have one.",
      "\"They are often found incidentally on scans done for unrelated reasons. Unless they grow large or rupture, they're usually silent,\" he said.",
      "Most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small, as most don't rupture and usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"Aneurysms themselves aren't dangerous unless they leak or burst, which leads to a life-threatening brain bleed,\" Snelling said.",
      "Hemorrhagic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhages are two types of brain bleeds related to ruptured brain aneurysms, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The best prevention is controlling blood pressure, avoiding smoking and stimulants, screening at-risk populations and monitoring with imaging, he added.",
      "Alleviating stress can be important in preventing a rupture, Arthur added, noting the development of aneurysms is \"something that can happen to anybody, regardless of risk factors.\"",
      "Arthur said if a patient has risks factors \u2014 for example, two close relatives with aneurysms \u2014 screenings can be done to check for them.",
      "\"If somebody is very worried or has a lot of risk factors, that's something that we can do for them,\" he said, adding he hopes Kardashian's news helps bring awareness.",
      "\"I don't want to scare people unnecessarily, but anything that we can use to put more of a focus on women's health and on how stroke can hurt women or cause disability, I think is something that we can make more positive,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 13:53:28 -0400",
    "summary": "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings,\" Misty Copeland reflects on her decision to step away from the American Ballet Theatre.",
    "story": [
      "Under the bright lights of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, Misty Copeland took her final bow, a moment that marked not just the end of a performance but the close of a chapter that transformed American ballet. The trailblazing dancer, who shattered racial barriers in the art form, retired on Wednesday as a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre after 25 years with the company.",
      "But she told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview that the decision to perform one last time wasn't something she initially wanted.",
      "\"It's been such an interesting kind of lead up to this moment, because I in all honesty I didn't wanna come back to the stage and have this moment,\" she told Gayle King.",
      "When asked why, Copeland explained that by 2019, her last year performing with the American Ballet Theatre\u00a0before taking a 5-year hiatus, she had begun to feel drained after decades of dancing.",
      "\"I really was starting to feel burnt out, kind of losing that passion that I've had my whole career and whole life for dance,\" she said. \"And I always promised myself I wouldn't go onstage if I didn't feel that I was delivering from my heart and, you know, my soul.\"",
      "She said that after taking time away, she viewed her return as an opportunity for closure and gratitude.",
      "\"In taking these five years, and really thinking about what this moment means in terms of just closure and saying thank you, that, I think, is what has gotten me back onstage for the show,\" Copeland said.",
      "The final bow",
      "At Copeland's farewell gala at Lincoln Center, Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who honored her career and impact.",
      "\"Misty Copeland didn't just perform ballet, she changed it,\" Winfrey said. \"She did. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"",
      "Allen also praised Copeland's influence. \"You are a prophecy come true. A prophecy of goodness, and genius and grace and power,\" she said.",
      "Copeland helped organize the evening's program, which included a scene from \"Romeo and Juliet.\"",
      "\"I really wanted to do this piece because Calvin Royal, he's the second Black male principal dancer in ABT's history,\" Copeland said. \"And we were set to perform the full-length ballet, the first two Black dancers to perform the leads together at ABT right before the pandemic hit. And then that never came to fruition. So I thought, even though it's not the full ballet, to be able to perform just a piece of it.\"",
      "The night ended with a standing ovation. Copeland received bouquets from her husband, Olu Evans, and their 3-year-old son, Jackson, who saw her perform for the first time.",
      "Redefining ballet",
      "Copeland looked back on the moment that made history, becoming the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre. She said the title carried a deeper meaning beyond personal recognition.",
      "\"I think that and I've gone back and forth over the years in terms of, like, what that really means and the title is what has opened the doors for the next generation,\" she said.",
      "Her 2015 promotion was celebrated around the world, but it also brought new challenges. Copeland said the attention came with intense pressure and unfair expectations. \"There were articles being written, 'If Misty doesn't go onstage and perform Swan Lake perfectly does she deserve to be a principal dancer? Is this because she's Black? Is this why she's getting this opportunity?'\" she recalled.",
      "For Copeland, ballet was never just about perfect lines or technical mastery. \"I know deep down, like, to me the art form and dance is not even, it's not about, these technical feats. It's not about, to me, the aesthetic and, and what's on the outside. To me what's saved my life is the storytelling, and being able to kind of step into this beautiful world and express myself in ways that I couldn't as a child,\" she said.",
      "Her relationship with dance began at 13, an age when most professional ballerinas were already years into their training. Growing up amid uncertainty and instability, she said ballet became a place of safety and self-discovery.",
      "\"I felt beautiful and I felt powerful and I felt strong and I felt like I had a voice. I felt confident and I felt stability for the first time in my life,\" she said. \"Because the way I grew up there was no stability. There was a lot of chaos and movement, and, didn't always have a home and food on the table. And so ballet became, dance allowed me to flourish. It gave me structure. It gave me discipline. It gave me grace. It gave me a purpose.\"",
      "As diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives face growing criticism, Copeland said she believes this is the right time to step away from performing.",
      "\"I think it's the exact right time for me to be stepping off the stage for this,\" she said. \"Because I think that the impact that I can have off the stage is, is going to be, greater than what I've done. It's been 25 years that I've been a Black body on this stage, and I think that there's been a lot of movement and shifts.\"",
      "She said progress in ballet must also happen behind the curtain.",
      "\"It's more than just seeing yourself on the stage. It's what's being implemented behind the scenes,\" she said. \"It's the schools. It's how are we getting teachers in schools who look like the children they're serving? It's getting board members who are making these decisions who represent a greater group of people. There's so much work to be done.\"",
      "Copeland also announced that she will \u00a0be joining ABT's board of trustees.",
      "\"You know, it's not common that you see artists come onto boards and that you see women of color. And so to be able to have a seat at the table \u2014 in a really impactful way \u2014 I think is progress. And that, to me, is \u2014 is so thrilling and so exciting to be able to stay connected to this company that has been everything to me. I mean, it's been my dream since I was 13 years old. And I still to this day can't believe I've been able to live it out the way that I have.\"",
      "Copeland said the timing of her departure was important.",
      "\"I always said to myself, like, I'm not gonna be that ballerina that they're pulling off by the pointe shoes, like, 'Girl, it's time.' You know, that I wanna be able to say, you know, like, I feel good in this moment, and now is time for me to bow,\" she said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Wednesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Canada, a day after the chamber rebuked the president with another vote to block tariffs on Brazil.",
      "In a 50 to 46 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with their party to vote in favor of the resolution, which required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "For months, trade tensions have flared between the U.S. and Canada. In August, the president raised tariffs on the country to 35%, though a large share of goods remain exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Then, over the weekend, Mr. Trump said he is raising tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%, blasting the U.S.'s northern neighbor over an anti-tariff ad by the government of Ontario that used quotes from former President Ronald Reagan.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more\" to combat \"drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, forced a vote to challenge the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, effectively bypassing Senate leadership. He has argued that the tariffs on one of the nation's top trading partners aren't justified under the emergency.",
      "\"I don't think you can say that fentanyl is not an emergency vis-a-vis Mexico or China, but it is ridiculous to say that fentanyl is an emergency with respect to Canada,\" Kaine said. \"And it's a pretext that's just being used to pour more and more tariffs onto Canada.\"",
      "The vote came after the Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Wednesday's vote also marked the second time lawmakers have weighed in on the Canada tariffs, after the Senate approved a resolution aimed at blocking the levies in April.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:53:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Fed on Wednesday announced its second interest-rate cut of 2025, reducing borrowing costs in a move to spur U.S. hiring.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank might pause before further lowering borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.75% and 4%, down from its prior range of 4% to 4.25%. The Fed reduced rates by the same amount in September, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "In a Wednesday afternoon press conference to discuss the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said another rate cut at its next meeting, set for Dec. 10, \"isn't a foregone conclusion.\" That may disappoint some borrowers and investors, given that the Fed last month had penciled in an additional rate cut for its final meeting of the year.",
      "\"There were strongly differing views on how to proceed in December\" during the central bank's meeting today, Powell said. Those conflicting views mean \"we haven't made a decision about December. I'm saying something in addition here \u2014 that it's not to be seen as a foregone conclusion. In fact, far from it.\"",
      "He added, \"We've cut 50 more basis points in the last two meetings, and there's a sense from some, 'Let's pause here,' and a sense from others, 'Let's go ahead.'\"",
      "Stocks erased modest gains after Powell's comments, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.2% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping 0.4%.",
      "The central bank's move to ease monetary policy is aimed at shoring up economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, spurring consumer spending and investment by businesses. Although the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has delayed release of the Labor Department's September jobs report, other indicators point to a continued slowdown in hiring. The ADP National Employment Report, for instance, showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 last month.",
      "In its policy\u00a0statement on Wednesday, the Fed said \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting last month that risks to the labor market are growing.",
      "While Powell said the Fed is watching layoff announcements from large businesses such as Amazon, he added that the weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating. His comments indicate that another back-to-back rate cut this year isn't a certainty, financial experts said.",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn't a sure thing,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email. Investors \"were negatively surprised that future cuts might be taken off the table.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the panel that sets the Fed's monetary policy, isn't scheduled to meet on interest rates in November.",
      "Data blackout",
      "The near-total blackout on government economic data during the shutdown may complicate the Fed's decision-making, experts said. Typically, Fed officials are able to draw on a host of official reports, ranging from measures of employment growth to inflation markers, as they seek to determine the best path for policy.",
      "\"While today's rate cut and the general direction of future policy remain relatively clear, guidance on the committee's perspective on economic conditions is more necessary than ever,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"A prolonged government shutdown and ongoing tariff negotiations continue to introduce significant uncertainty into the immediate monetary policy outlook.\"",
      "Powell noted that the lack of official economic data may complicate the Fed's December decision, given that the central bank relies on such information to assess the economy.",
      "\"What do you do when you are driving in the fog? You slow down,\" Powell said.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 FOMC members voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, with two members objecting. Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, preferring a 0.50 percentage point cut, as he did at the September meeting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffry Schmid also dissented, saying he preferred no rate change.",
      "Inflation battle",
      "While the Fed is now focused on weakness in the labor market, its battle against inflation isn't over. The Fed cranked rates higher after consumer prices soared during the pandemic, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Because higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, businesses and consumers typically react by paring spending, which dampens demand throughout the economy and cools inflation. Since mid-2022, inflation has receded to an annual rate of 3% as of September, although that remains higher than the Fed's target of a 2% annual pace.",
      "While the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs are starting to trickle through to consumer prices, the impact has been more muted than economists had predicted earlier this year. Some businesses are eating some of the tariff costs, while others stocked up on imports earlier in the year to get ahead of the import duties.",
      "\"Though inflation is still higher than comfortable, the jobs market is holding on to signs of weakness, and their desire to stimulate the economy further is likely to continue outweighing inflation concerns,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at financial services company TruStage.",

      "Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs companywide on Wednesday (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The rest of the cuts are expected to be made at a later date. In all, 2,000 job reductions amount to about 10% of Paramount's total workforce.",
      "\"These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company,\" CEO David Ellison wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees.",
      "The prospect of job cuts has hovered over Paramount employees for some time. Ellison on Wednesday reiterated that the company has been working to restructure since the completion of its merger in August, and noted that workforce cuts are \"part of that process.\"",
      "It's not uncommon for businesses to initiate layoffs following a merger. When Skydance completed its purchase of Paramount, the combined company said it would look for \"opportunities to streamline its business.\" Paramount is also rumored to have interest in buying Warner Bros.

    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

      "Hospitals nationwide are urging the Trump administration to reconsider a steep new fee for hiring highly skilled workers from other countries. Many turn to medical professionals from abroad to fill the gaps, but the new $100,000 price tag for the popular H-1B visa is making that nearly impossible, particularly for midsize hospitals or smaller.",
      "\"We need to stabilize,\" said Jamie White, the chief nursing officer at Frederick Health in Maryland. She also said, \"We have had a continual desire to bring on about 100 nurses for the last three years.\"",
      "Frederick Health, like others nationwide, looked abroad to fill in the gaps, planning to sponsor up to 45 nurses on H-1B visas. Now, those plans are on hold, with a new $100,000 fee to obtain the visa and hire foreign employees.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-ups-layoffs-labor-market-jobs-economy/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 09:43:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Amazon and UPS on Tuesday announced tens of thousands of job cuts, the latest signal that the U.S. labor market is downshifting.",
    "story": [
      "For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as \"no hire, no fire\" \u2014 a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.",
      "Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company.",
      "Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.",
      "The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring\u00a0in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said.",
      "\"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past,\" John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News.",
      "\"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,\" he added.",
      "Layoffs picking up",
      "Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.",
      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",
      "In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent\u00a0CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as \"bad,\" up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.",
      "\"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious,\" Challenger said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-interest-rate-meeting-decision-october-29-forecast/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 07:44:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Concerns about a weakening labor market may outweigh worries about rising inflation, tipping the Fed toward another rate cut, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is set to make its next interest rate decision today, even as a near-total blackout of federal economic data continues amid the government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department, however, on Friday released one key report ahead of its meeting:\u00a0the Consumer Price Index. That report showed that the inflation rate rose at a pace of 3% last month, cooler than expected, as the impact of President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs have so far been more muted than economists have forecast.",
      "Economists say the softer inflation report likely opens the door to a rate cut today.",
      "\"Concerns about tariffs driving prices higher are still not showing up in most categories,\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said Friday in an email. \"Nothing in the inflation print should stop the Fed from cutting rates next week. Yes, prices are higher, but not enough to keep them from helping the economy,\" he added.",
      "There's a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Oct. 29,\u00a0according to CME FedWatch, which bases its predictions on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",
      "A quarter-point cut would bring down the benchmark rate to a range of between 3.75% to 4%, down from its current range of between 4% to 4.25%, and mark the Fed's second rate cut this year.",
      "What's the argument for cutting rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low. When inflation is soaring \u2014 such as when it hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 the Fed ratchets rates higher to make borrowing more expensive, which in turn dissuades consumers and businesses from spending, tempering inflation.",
      "But a weak labor market can be bolstered by lower interest rates, because it's easier for businesses to expand and hire more workers if it's less expensive to borrow money.",
      "When Powell last month announced the Fed's first rate cut of 2025, he signaled the central bank was growing increasingly concerned about a sharp slowdown in the labor market. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in September.",
      "However, the monthly jobs report for September wasn't released earlier this month due to the federal shutdown. In an Oct. 14 speech, Powell acknowledged the data halt, yet added that the central bank has access to \"a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.\"",
      "According to those sources of information, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" Powell noted.",
      "Friday's CPI report \"should keep the Fed focused on the labor market in terms of the near-term policy trajectory. In the absence of the September jobs report, an October cut appears to be a done deal,\" Bank of America economists noted in a Friday research report.",
      "How would a rate cut impact your money?",
      "While a quarter-point rate cut is relatively small, it would come after September's reduction \u2014 and economists are also expecting the Fed to usher in a third cut at its December meeting. Together, that means the benchmark rate by year-end could sit 0.75 percentage points lower than it was in January.",
      "That would help reduce rates for credit cards and loans such as home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Those types of credit products are based on the prime rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other, and which in turn is based on the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have already dipped ahead of the Fed's rate decision. While mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, they're\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.19% as of Oct. 23, marking their lowest level in a year, according to Freddie Mac. Homebuyers might not see much more of a break, at least in the near-term, economists said.",
      "\"Mortgage rates have moved down notably in advance of the Fed's meeting, hitting their lowest level in more than a year, but further declines will depend on new developments,\" noted Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale in an email. \"The Fed's decisions are anticipated by the market, which means that the upcoming rate cut and several more over the next few months are already largely priced in.\"",

      "\"It's always noise, all the time,\" Hopkins told CBS News, adding, \"We honestly didn't know how big of a scale it was gonna be... Some mornings it's hard to get out of our driveway, just because of all the dump trucks.\"",
      "Louisiana approved the $10 billion project in August, saying it would bring \"hope\" for economic growth.",
      "But some experts say the center's power demands will raise customers' power bills statewide. The state's main utility company \u2014 Entergy \u2014 agreed to pay for a $550 million transmission line to the center, a cost that experts say will be passed on to the 1.1 million customers under Entergy Louisiana's umbrella. This, in a parish where nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, according to the state's utility commission.",
      "That's not the only reason people in Louisiana could see higher utility bills \u2014  state officials who approved the plan admit the increased energy demand from the site could, in turn, increase gas prices.",
      "\"This single data center is set to span an amount of land that is about 70 football fields worth of land, and it's going to consume roughly three times the amount of electricity that the entire city of New Orleans consumes on an annual basis,\" Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, told CBS News.",
      "The Hopkins family showed CBS News their power bills, which indicated the fuel costs on their bill went up by about $13 a month compared to last year.",
      "As the nationwide construction boom in new data centers continues, other communities are already feeling the impacts. Some customers in at least 13 states are seeing higher utility bills because of new data centers, according to the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "\"We're all kind of sharing the pain in that fight,\" Arbaje said. \"It's up to state regulators, really, to step in and protect consumers and make sure that tech companies and utility companies are paying their fair share for this development.\"",
      "Meta's head of community development in North America, Katie Comer, said they're working with Entergy to reduce customer impacts, telling CBS News that Meta has \"invested a million dollars into their bill pay assistance program to support low-income families.\"",
      "Asked about concerns from residents that Meta is imposing on the neighborhood, Comer said, \"We are actively on the ground every day. We want to listen and learn and meet the community where they're at.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 19:05:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate passed a measure that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, after Democrats drew support from a handful of Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted on Tuesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure in a rebuke to the president.",
      "Led by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, the resolution would terminate the national emergency that the administration is using to impose 50% tariffs on goods from Brazil.",
      "The vote to approve the measure was 52 to 48. Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul joined Democrats to vote in favor. The resolution required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil\" that he said constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup in 2022.",
      "\"President Trump's tariff regime \u2014 global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted \u2014 have created huge chaos in the national economy,\" Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was \"unusual and extreme,\" and accused him of putting it in place due to the \"decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend.\"",
      "\"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations,\" Kaine said.",
      "The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that \"the president is responsive to things like this.\"",
      "\"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,\" he said.",
      "One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years \u2014 including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.",
      "\"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,\" McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. \"The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.",
      "\"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first,\" Vance told reporters after the meeting. \"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country. They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The president cited a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in his order imposing the Brazil tariffs. The act gives any senator the authority to force a vote to challenge the move, effectively bypassing Senate leadership.",
      "In April, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve a measure aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs. Those Republicans were Murkowski of Alaska, Collins of Maine and McConnell, along with Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who cosponsored the legislation. Later that month, an effort aimed at blocking Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world fell short, with two senators who had previously backed the tariff measure absent from the vote. The resolutions need a simple majority to pass.",
      "Kaine said he would force additional votes on Canadian tariffs and global tariffs throughout the week as he pushes back on the administration and puts pressure on Senate Republicans.",
      "\"So the votes are about tariffs, and they're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about, how much will we let a president get away with?\" Kaine said. \"Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?\"",

      "Some airlines are stepping in to help feed air traffic controllers and other unpaid federal aviation workers who missed their first full paycheck on Tuesday,\u00a0Day 28 of the government shutdown.",
      "United Airlines told CBS News that it is helping support essential workers who are going unpaid during the stalemate in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"United is donating meals for air traffic controllers and other federal workers whose pay is delayed. We appreciate the hardworking federal employees who are keeping the air travel system running,\" the airline said in a statement.",
      "United said that it's feeding workers at the airline's hubs across the country, including in Chicago; Denver; Houston; Los Angeles; Newark, N.J.; San Francisco; and Washington, D.C.",
      "Delta Air Lines also confirmed to CBS News that it has \"arranged for a limited number of meals for transportation sector workers,\" while noting that it is operating \"within the strict rules established for employees of federal government agencies.\"",
      "Additionally, JetBlue said it is working with its federal partners, including local aviation officials, \"to offer meals at our airports as a gesture of support.\" The airline said it's working with the Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Federal Aviation Administration to coordinate those efforts.",
      "At a press conference on Tuesday at LaGuardia Airport in New York, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted air traffic controllers' financial struggles\u00a0as they go without pay.",
      "\"This is day one,\" he said of controllers missing their first full paychecks. \"Day two gets harder, [and] day three is harder after that, as expenses continue to roll [in].\"",
      "Duffy also noted that controllers are calling in sick in larger numbers than usual, as some seek side gigs with companies like\u00a0Uber or DoorDash\u00a0to make ends meet\u00a0during the shutdown.",
      "Speaking at the same event, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels also emphasized the financial pressure on his members.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "On average this year, 5% of flight delays were attributed to air traffic controller shortages, Duffy said. The personnel shortages at some airports were responsible for roughly 44% of the\u00a08,700 flight delays\u00a0on Sunday, while accounting for 24% of Monday's delays, according to Duffy.",
      "Controllers were planning to gather outside at least 17 airports nationwide on Tuesday to hand out leaflets urging an end to the shutdown, according to The Associated Press.",
      "\"The pressure is real,\" air traffic controller Joe Segretto, who works at a regional radar facility that directs planes at airports in the New York area, said at the press conference at LaGuardia. \"We have people trying to keep these airplanes safe. We have trainees that are trying to learn a new job that is very fast-paced, very stressful, very complex now having to worry about how they're going to pay bills.\"",

    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mom who lives in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation, and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

      "Over the past year, Suzann Hernandez and Camilo Aguirre have put a lot of effort into lowering their energy bill. Beyond simple solutions like turning off lights or closing doors when either the heat or AC was on, the couple insulated their windows and kept the temperature set at a strict 76 degrees, even on the hottest days of summer.",
      "Despite their best efforts, however, their energy savings strategy had little impact against a rate hike that went into effect in their home state of New Jersey on June 1. The increase, approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in February, raised the average electric bill for residents in the state by 17%, according to a letter the state's largest utility company sent to customers earlier this year.",
      "\"We thought [we'd] see at least a $50 decrease,\" Hernandez told CBS News' correspondent Tom Hanson. \"When we compared it to what we got this year, we only saw a $20 decrease.\"",
      "It's not only residents in the Garden State who are feeling the pinch of higher prices.",
      "\"This is a national problem,\" Dan Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, told CBS News.",

That's almost double the $16 billion in requests and approvals over the same period in 2024.",
      "Those rate hikes are expected to show up in the bills of over 124 million customers this year, PowerLines found. For those Americans already struggling to make ends meet the hikes will mean additional economic hardship, the organization said in its report.",
      "By and large, customers nationwide are feeling powerless in the face of the escalating energy costs.",
      "\"It feels like there's nothing we can do about it,\" said Karin Gudal, an AES Ohio customer quoted in PowerLines report. \"We can try to make our buildings as energy efficient as we can...but even that takes money.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 21:14:35 -0400",
    "summary": "Most federal workers are entitled to back pay when the shutdown ends, but there are some exceptions.",
    "story": [
      "Some federal workers who are not being paid during the government shutdown have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved.",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal employees\u00a0whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are\u00a0hunkering down\u00a0and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends.",
      "Do all federal workers get back pay?",
      "Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the\u00a0Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.",
      "The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee's standard rate of pay.\"",
      "Legal challenges",
      "However, a draft memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we're talking about.\"",
      "Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act \"is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations.\"",
      "Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers.",
      "\"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The memo also contradicts previous guidance\u00a0published\u00a0in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the agency's notice read. However, an updated version\u00a0of guidelines strikes that language.",
      "\"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted,\" the OPM now states in its guidance.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends.",
      "When would back pay arrive?",
      "The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, \"The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment.\"",
      "Federal workers' last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with no resolution on the horizon.",
      "What about government contractors?",
      "In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay.",
      "\"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute,\" LeRoy said.",
      "They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded.",
      "What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown?",
      "Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers \"who lost their employment through no fault of their own,\" according to a fact sheet.",
      "Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo.",
      "When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states. Excepted workers are not considered unemployed and therefore are not eligible for unemployment benefits in most states, Tom Spiggle, employment attorney and founder of the Spiggle Law Firm, told CBS News.",

      "After several years of losing money on cattle, Burleen and Pete Wobeter thought this would finally be the year things turned around. Their Iowa farm also grows corn and soybeans \u2014 crops that have been hit hard by the trade war with China \u2014 but cattle had been a bright spot so far in 2025.",
      "\"This year, it is the one thing that is going to make any money for us,\" Burleen said.",
      "That's why they were astounded when President Trump announced he wanted to quadruple beef imports from Argentina, claiming it would \"bring our beef prices down\" and help \"a very good ally.\"",
      "His words sent wholesale cattle prices plummeting.",
      "\"I thought the whole point of tariffs was to bring production back home, and now he is trying to do something to destroy that production,\" Burleen said, adding, \" It feels like being a pawn in a game we're not going to win.\"",
      "\"We're being used and abused as producers,\" Pete added.",
      "For farmers across the U.S., this harvest season brought a new kind of uncertainty. China, once the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, cut off purchases after tariffs escalated, leaving producers with full silos and falling prices.",
      "The Wobeters were hoping stronger cattle prices could make up for those losses.",
      "But while cattle ranchers are earning less, shoppers aren't seeing any savings. Ground beef is up nearly 13% and steak is up 16% over the past year, according to federal data. Economists say the spike is tied to drought, high feed costs and a shrinking U.S. cattle herd \u2014 now at its lowest level in decades.",
      "Bryan Whaley, CEO of the Iowa Cattlemen's Association, said more imports from Argentina won't fix that.",
      "\"You have to look at the total supply chain,\" Whaley said. \"It really only is gonna be about 2.5% of our total beef supply. So it's really not going to make a substantial difference.\"",
      "To help farmers and ranchers weather the downturn, the Trump administration announced last week it would release about $3 billion in assistance by tapping a fund used in Mr. Trump's first term to aid farmers, officials told CBS News.",

That potential aid package is on the back burner due to the shutdown, and is separate from the $3 billion in new assistance, a senior administration official said.",
      "At the same time, the administration recently hinted that new trade agreements could also help turn things around for soybean farmers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that new deals, including one with China, would be positive for U.S. agriculture.",
      "\"Soybean farmers are going to be extremely happy with this deal for this year and for the coming years,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-beef-coffee-bananas-food-prices-cpi/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 15:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are paying significantly more for these food staples, price inflation data shows. Will inflation ever relent?",
    "story": [
      "For evidence that the cost of food in the U.S. remains hard to stomach for many households, look no further than the price of bananas, beef and coffee.",
      "Banana prices were up 6.9% in September from a year ago, ground beef has risen 12.9% and roasted coffee has jumped an eye-watering 18.9%, according to the most recent\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0data for September. And now for the bad news.",
      "\"One of the questions that I'm asked a lot is, when are prices coming down? And my answer is simple: never,\" Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News. \"The best that we can hope for is stabilization.\"",
      "So what's behind the surging price of such foods? There are a mix of factors, ranging from the impact of climate change on crop harvests and U.S. tariffs on imports to the simple laws of economics.",
      "Beef",
      "As of September, the average cost of a pound of ground beef was $6.30, according to Federal Reserve\u00a0data\u00a0\u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s and 65% higher than in late 2019, just before COVID-19 ravaged the economy.",
      "Over the trailing 12 months through September, the cost of ground beef has climbed 65 cents per pound, or more than 11%, while the cost of a pound of boneless sirloin steak has jumped $2.35, or around 20%, the CBS News Price Tracker shows\u00a0(see below).",
      "The main reason beef has become painfully expensive comes down to economics and climate: As global temperatures rise, shrinking cattle herds are straining the nation's beef supply even as demand remains strong. As with any other product, prices tend to rise when demand outstrips supply.",
      "Simply, \"The problem is that there's less cows,\" Lempert said.",
      "As of July, there were 28.7 million beef cows across the U.S., the lowest number in decades, USDA\u00a0data\u00a0shows. Experts say the decline in the nation's cattle count is mainly due to intensifying droughts in recent decades that have forced farmers to reduce their herds. During a drought from 2011 to 2015, for example, farmers and ranchers were forced to reduce their herd sizes by up to 2% a year, the USDA has\u00a0found.",
      "Other factors lifting beef prices include higher grain costs and labor supply shortages at slaughterhouses, according to Lempert.",
      "According to Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, domestic beef production is projected to account for 90% of total consumption in the U.S. in 2025.",
      "As for beef from Brazil, America's largest import source, Peel said tariffs could also curb supplies. The total tariff on Brazilian beef imports now sits at 76.4%,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "Coffee",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, or shortly before the pandemic, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are behind this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, are depressing crop yields, Lempert explained. Earlier this month, for example, coffee prices rose after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted the return of\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a, a recurring weather pattern that influences global temperatures. That raised concerns about the possibility of drought in Brazil.",
      "Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, said global prices for bananas and coffee will continue to be sensitive to extreme heat or drought conditions, especially because the products are cultivated in a relatively small number of regions around the world.",
      "\"These types of price sensitivities will look like inflation to the average consumer,\" he said.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023 the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, a 10% tariff on Colombia and a 20% tax on Vietnam. In Brazil, that has led producers to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, throttling supplies in the U.S., according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization, an intergovernmental membership organization for the coffee sector, cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",
      "Bananas",
      "Bananas remain cheaper than most fruits, but even this grocery store staple isn't immune from inflation. The average cost of the potassium-rich fruit rose to 67 cents per pound in September \u2014 the highest price on record in the U.S. and up 10 cents, or nearly 18%, since late 2019,\u00a0according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Among consumers, the issue caused an uproar last year after Trader Joe's announced it was upping the price of its bananas for the first time in over two decades, from 19 cents each to 23 cents.",
      "As with coffee beans, supply constraints and tariffs have pushed up banana prices, experts note. Most bananas sold in the U.S. are imported from Central and South America. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, Guatemala supplied 40% of U.S. bananas in 2023, while Ecuador and Costa Rica each accounted for 16%.",
      "Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Banana Importers Association, recently told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0that U.S. tariffs on bananas from Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Costa Rica remain in effect, with levies as high as 15%.",
      "A pesky fungal disease known as Panama Disease has also reduced U.S. banana supplies, specifically threatening Cavendish bananas, the most popular variety, Lempert noted.",
      "\"The banana that we know and love is getting destroyed by different pests,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Jim Farley discusses the difficulties of tariffs in imported parts, which have cost Ford a billion dollars \u2013 and may give an advantage to their competitors. He also explains why he drives a Chinese-made electric vehicle.",
    "story": [
      "At Ford's Michigan Assembly outside Detroit, more than 4,500 hourly employees turn out about 100,000 Broncos a year \u2013 a new one every 60 seconds.",
      "For obvious reasons, Ford's been touting its commitment to American manufacturing. It advertises itself as employing the most hourly workers in the country \u2013 and more than 80 percent of its vehicles sold in the U.S. are indeed made in America. That's the highest share of any Detroit automaker.",
      "But Ford imports many parts, and has been hit hard by President Trump's tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley says it's not affordable to make all the parts here, and that if Ford only used American-made parts, American-made cars would be too expensive for many Americans to buy.",
      "And there are some components, Farley says, that no one even makes in America: \"There are parts, fasteners, wiring looms from other countries. And we pay our tariffs, sometimes up to 70 percent on those parts.\"",
      "And who is paying for those tariffs? \"Well, the company right now,\" he said. \"And in the end of the day, it's all these workers.\"",
      "Farley has deep roots in Michigan. His grandfather was Ford Motor Company's 389th employee \u2013 one of the first to help build the Model T. \u00a0But Farley himself is not a Ford lifer. Before joining the company in 2007, he spent nearly two decades at Toyota.",
      "And how did that go over in the Farley family when he went to Toyota? \"Not well,\" Jim laughed. \"Because at the time, you know, they were just, all through the '70s, there was just job loss after job loss across southeast Michigan. And my grandfather was thinking about all the people that lost their jobs. And they were like, Why? Why are you doing this?\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see similarities between the '80s, when the U.S. auto industry was facing the increased competition from Japan, to today where it's China?\"",
      "\"Oh, I think it's exactly the same thing, but it's on steroids,\" Farley replied.",
      "\"A completely different level of risk for our industry\"",
      "Ironically, it's a Biden-era tariff that has so far spared Detroit from that competition. In May of last year, the U.S. imposed a 100% surcharge on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which effectively bans them from the American road. But Chinese EVs are gaining ground in Europe, Latin America, and especially China, the world's largest market.",
      "Farley has called these small, inexpensive, tech-savvy cars an existential threat. \"They have enough capacity in China with existing factories to serve the entire North American market, put us all out of business,\" he said. \"Japan never had that. So, this is a completely different level of risk for our industry.\"",
      "\"Are the Chinese cars being made today something Americans would want to buy?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Farley. \"I drive a Xiaomi SU7. High quality, great digital experience.\"",
      "\"You're driving a Chinese car? Why?\"",
      "\"Because of the competition. And to beat them, you have to know them.\"",
      "Farley's firsthand experience with Chinese EVs is a big reason Ford is pivoting to smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This past summer, in announcing production of a new midsize electric pickup truck to sell for $30,000, Farley said, \"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.\"",
      "That hands-on approach is one holdover from his days at Toyota. Another is his annual road trip to see his products in action. \"I believe in genchi genbutsu. It's a Japanese word that means 'go and see where the work is actually done.' I took a Lightning through California with my son. And it became pretty clear that we had a big problem with our charging network. So, after that trip, I called Elon [Musk]. Out of the blue, never met him or anything. I was like, is there any way you would share your supercharging network with Ford?\"",
      "If you heard his name and noticed the resemblance to the late actor Chris Farley, you weren't wrong: the \"Saturday Night Live\" star was Jim Farley's cousin. \"I think there's, uh, a little bit of kid in all of us Farleys, a little bit of that kind of devilish, little snarky tomfoolery,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I would say I was, you know, kind of on the pretty serious side of the Farley spectrum!\"",
      "Jim Farley will need every bit of that serious side to steer Ford through one of its biggest economic and political tests in decades \u2013 building a future that keeps tens of thousands of American auto workers on the line. \"What I care about is that transformation of Ford,\" he said. \"I'd like to be able to come back here in 20 years, if I'm still alive, and see all the people, that they're still busy, like my grandfather. My grandfather had nothing until he had the Ford job. Our jobs as leaders are about them.\"",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story  stated that Ford would have a $2 billion tariff bill, amounting to 20%  of the company's global profits. Due to  recent changes to the Trump administration's  tariff program, including an extension to an offset program for  imported parts on domestically-assembled automobiles, Ford now estimates  that tariffs will cost the company $1 billion.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:03:48 -0400",
    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:03:23 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

      "The new notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November. That program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the\u00a0USDA notice\u00a0says. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"",
      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record. While the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cutoff would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans \u2014 and some of those most in need \u2014 unless a political resolution is found in just a few days.",
      "The administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiations.",

    "story": [
      "German businessman Alexander B\u00f6cker was reading the news with his wife last Sunday when she told him about a robbery at the Louvre in Paris.",
      "\"My wife said, 'Well, look at this: Somebody broke into the Louvre. There's a robbery going on!'\" he recalled in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Right away, his wife, Julia Scharwatz, noticed something familiar: the lift used in the robbery looked just like one that their company makes.",
      "\"If you know the product, you can really quickly identify that it was your product,\" B\u00f6cker said on Friday. \"It became clear to us that this is a reprehensible act, and they have used our machine for it.\"",
      "The machine was the B\u00f6cker Agilo, a lift that can be used in construction or to hoist furniture to apartments through upper-story windows.",
      "It is just one of the machines that B\u00f6cker's company \u2014 called B\u00f6cker \u2014 manufactures. And as more details of the robbery emerged \u2014 particularly that no one had been hurt \u2014 B\u00f6cker and Scharwatz, who works alongside her husband as the company's head of marketing, began getting messages from colleagues and employees asking: \"Can't we make something out of it?\"",
      "The next day, the brainstorming began as they tried to think of new ways to advertise in the wake of the heist, which saw thieves run off with an estimated $102 million\u00a0in jewels. The robbers used the B\u00f6cker lift to get to a second-story balcony where they accessed the Louvre by cutting through a window, and officials say they got in and out in just four minutes.",
      "One proposed ad slogan was: \"'Well even criminal professionals are using the best machinery,' something like that,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "But it was Scharwatz who had the winning idea \u2014 to focus on the speed of B\u00f6cker machines.",
      "\"We bought the picture, and then we had to decide: Shall we do it or not? And I said, 'Well, I hope everybody gets our sense of humor.' You know, normally, the Germans are not very famous for having a sense of humor,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "He said he felt like it was \"a very thin line,\" but because no one had been hurt, \"we said: 'Let's go for it.'\"",
      "The final ad, published on social media, shows an image of the B\u00f6cker machine positioned outside the Louvre after the robbery.",
      "\"If you're in a hurry,\" the tagline says. That's followed by details about the product: \"The B\u00f6cker Agilo carries your treasures up to 400 kg at 42 m/min \u2014 quiet as a whisper thanks to its 230 V electric motor.\"",
      "A post shared by B\u00f6cker Maschinenwerke GmbH (@boeckermaschinenwerke)",
      "The response to the campaign has been mixed. Many have found it funny, with some who work in marketing and advertising reaching out to the company calling it smart.",
      "It has also gotten a lot of attention. Posts on the company's social media sites typically draw 15,000-20,000 views per post, B\u00f6cker said, but this one garnered more than 4.3 million views on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"So, yeah, it is quite an unusual event for us,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "That publicity, though, has not translated into sales, at least yet.",
      "\"The normal customer base, especially in Europe, they know the product pretty well. We are (a) market leader in that segment,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"Maybe now, in other countries where this product is not so well known or not so known at all, there is maybe an interest.\"",
      "B\u00f6cker wanted to make clear, though, that neither he nor his company support the robbery at the Louvre.",
      "\"We are against, completely against, criminal activities, and we are also a serious company. 620 employees in Germany. Everything is produced in Germany, and we are also for safety,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"It was just a world event happening with one of our machines, and we tried to use it. And we really do not want \u2026 anybody to get bad feelings about that. And if so, we are sorry for that.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military carried out another strike on an alleged \"narco-trafficking vessel\" in the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, killing four people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said \u2014 marking at least the 15th boat to be hit in the Trump administration's two-month-long campaign of strikes that have killed more than 60 people.",
      "Hegseth posted a video of a boat strike on X. He said the strike was conducted in international waters, and alleged that the boat was operated by an unnamed designated terrorist organization. He said no U.S. forces were harmed.",
      "The military began striking alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean Sea early last month, and expanded the gambit to the Eastern Pacific in recent weeks. In some \u2014 but not all \u2014 cases, the Trump administration has said the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "The administration has vowed to continue carrying out the strikes, arguing the U.S. is in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels and gangs in Latin America, many of which the U.S. has designated as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "\"The Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans,\" Hegseth wrote Wednesday on X. \"The Department of War will continue to hunt them down and eliminate them wherever they operate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of strikes on land-based targets, saying last week, \"the land is going to be next.\"",
      "The campaign has drawn pushback from some lawmakers\u00a0who want more evidence that the targets were actually smuggling drugs and warn that it could draw the U.S. into a conflict in the region. Congress has not authorized the strikes, though the Trump administration argues it doesn't need permission from the legislature.",
      "Venezuela and Colombia have also expressed outrage over the strikes, which are part of a broader military buildup in the Caribbean, with several U.S. ships and thousands of troops deploying to the region.",
      "The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of partnering with drug traffickers \u2014 a charge he denies. A U.S. warship docked in nearby Trinidad and Tobago over the weekend, which the Venezuelan government called a \"hostile provocation.\"",

      "President Trump said Wednesday that South Korea can build a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "\"Our Military Alliance is stronger than ever before and, based on that, I have given them approval to build a Nuclear Powered Submarine, rather than the old fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel powered Submarines that they have now,\" the president wrote on Truth Social during a multiday visit to South Korea.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the submarine will be built in Philadelphia, as the president and lawmakers seek foreign investments as a way to boost the American shipbuilding industry. A South Korean company bought the Philly Shipyard last year.",
      "During a meeting with Mr. Trump earlier Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said he's looking for U.S. support in getting nuclear fuel for submarines. He argued that shifting away from diesel-electric submarines \u2014 which typically have more limited ranges \u2014 would allow South Korea to help the U.S. Navy patrol the region.",
      "\"We're not aiming for nuclear-armed submarines, but rather, conventionally armed submarines powered by nuclear energy,\" Lee said through a translator, saying his country's existing fleet has \"limited capabilities\" and \"cannot really effectively monitor and counter any undersea activities from other countries.\"",
      "Nuclear-powered submarines are a key part of the U.S.'s naval fleet, and the advanced technology necessary to build them is closely guarded by U.S. officials. The Biden administration inked a deal with Australia to help the country build the submarines.",
      "The move could pose concerns for the U.S. and South Korea's two mutual rivals in the region, North Korea and China. The Chinese navy has nuclear-powered submarines, and North Korea said earlier this year it had developed one. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday local time, for talks that are expected to focus on trade.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the submarine deal as part of a broader trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner and a key military ally in the region.",
      "He said the country has agreed to \"pay the USA\" $350 billion, invest in U.S. industry, and buy American oil and gas in exchange for lower U.S. tariffs on South Korean imports. Mr. Trump outlined a similar deal over the summer, which called for 15% tariffs on South Korean goods.",

    "summary": "The move, if it occurs, would be in response to China's escalating hostilities near disputed waters as Trump is poised to meet with Xi, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As the highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping was set to take place in South Korea Thursday, the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command quietly issued an order this week to stage a \"show of force\" against recent Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, CBS News has learned.",
      "It's unclear when this operation would occur, if at all, as military operations can easily be canceled at the last minute, but the execute order from Indo-Pacific Command, the Defense Department's oldest and largest combatant unit overseeing operations across half the globe, directed American forces to carry out a precision strike demonstration in response to China's escalating hostilities near disputed waters. Two other sources confirmed that the operation had been prepared as an option, but they said the plan was unlikely to be executed.",
      "If launched, it's unclear what the HIMARS would target but the operation is intended to signal Washington's intent to push back against Beijing's expanding presence in the region and defend what U.S. officials describe as Philippine sovereignty and long-standing fishing rights.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, no reply has been returned from U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.",
      "The High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, delivers its greatest impact against fixed targets that can be located and struck with precision, such as ammunition depots or clusters of troops. Built by defense contractor Lockheed Martin, the system saw extensive use in the post-9/11 Iraq and Afghanistan wars and is prized by Ukraine in its fight against Russia.",
      "Scarborough Shoal, known in the Philippines as Bajo de Masinloc, sits within Manila's exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea, but Beijing has controlled access to the reef since a tense 2012 standoff between the two nations who both claim ownership of the shoal.",
      "China's presence there has grown steadily as its coast guard and maritime flotilla of ships regularly shadow or harass Philippine vessels and small fishing boats. In Sept. 2024, a\u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0crew witnessed China's naval aggressiveness while onboard a Philippine Coast Guard ship that was rammed by a Chinese coast guard vessel. The Philippine ship was on a mission to resupply ships and stations in the South China Sea at the time but was forced to abandon its first stop as Chinese vessels surrounded it.",
      "Recent high-resolution satellite photos released earlier this month shows what appears to be a floating barrier at the mouth of Scarborough reef. Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Ray Powell, a maritime analyst and director of SeaLight, a Stanford University-affiliated analysis group, posted the photographs captured by Satellogic on X and said China was responsible for installing the barrier.",
      "Both China and the Philippines have installed and later dismantled temporary barriers around the Scarborough Shoal before. One U.S. official said ideally, the operation by Indo-Pacific Command should occur ahead of the U.S.-China trade negotiations or before China establishes a more permanent barrier at the Scarborough reef.",
      "In August, a Chinese Coast Guard ship and a Chinese Navy vessel collided near the reef while pursuing a Philippine Coast Guard cutter. Weeks later, Beijing announced plans to create a \"nature reserve\" in the area \u2014 a move that was condemned by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and viewed by officials in Manila as another step toward solidifying Chinese control.",
      "\"Beijing claiming Scarborough Reef as a nature preserve is yet another coercive attempt to advance sweeping territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea at the expense of its neighbors, including by preventing Filipino fishermen from accessing these traditional fishing grounds,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"China's actions at Scarborough Reef continue to undermine regional stability.\"",
      "Speaking before fellow leaders of the Association of South East Asian Nations and Mr. Trump on Sunday in Kuala Lumpur, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., echoed Rubio's comments from September and condemned China, without directly naming it, for encroaching on Philippine sovereignty in its push for a \"nature reserve\" in Scarborough Shoal.",
      "\"The attempt of some actors to establish the so-called 'nature reserve' status over Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Shoal, which is a long-standing and integral part of the Philippines over which it has sovereignty and jurisdiction, clearly violates not only Philippine sovereignty, but also the traditional fishing rights of our people,\" said Marcos, who added that China is violating international law. He cited the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 Award on the South China Sea arbitration which rejected China's claims of historic rights over the territory.",

    "summary": "Border Patrol agents have been responsible for more Chicago-area arrests than ICE amid \"Midway Blitz,\" an unprecedented shift that has caused some internal tensions, CBS News has learned.",
    "story": [
      "Border Patrol agents have carried out more arrests in the Chicago area than their counterparts at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, illustrating the expanded role they are playing far away from U.S. borders under the Trump administration, internal federal government data obtained by CBS News indicates.",
      "This week, arrests by Customs and Border Protection in the Chicago-area \"Midway Blitz\" operation surpassed those recorded by ICE, the agency that is, on paper, responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws in the interior of the country.",
      "Since Sept. 16, agents at CBP have recorded roughly 1,500 arrests in the Chicago region, compared to over 1,400 arrests carried out by ICE officers, according to the internal Department of Homeland Security figures. In mid-October, ICE's arrest tally in the Chicago operation was higher, totaling around 1,000, compared to roughly 800 arrests recorded by CBP at the time.",
      "The government figures underscore the unprecedented way the second Trump administration has used Border Patrol agents, whose work has been historically limited to intercepting the illicit movement of people and drugs along the borders with Canada and Mexico, as well as some coastal sectors.",
      "As part of its nationwide mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has dispatched teams of green-uniformed Border Patrol agents across the country, instructing them to arrest suspected unauthorized immigrants in major Democratic-led cities.",
      "That effort has been spearheaded by Gregory Bovino, an outspoken Border Patrol sector chief who has personally led arrest operations, first in Los Angeles and Sacramento over the summer, and most recently in Chicago. He has gained infamy among critics who denounce his agents' tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate, as well as support among those who view him as an effective, no-nonsense enforcer of President Trump's aggressive clampdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the summer, sweeping \"roving patrols\" by Border Patrol agents in the Los Angeles area targeted day laborers at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes, triggering widespread local backlash, including accusations of racial profiling that federal officials have strongly denied.",
      "Nearly identical scenes have played out in the Chicago area in recent weeks, where the Border Patrol teams led by Bovino have conducted similarly aggressive operations, prompting protests and confrontations with local residents and activists. Videos posted on social media have depicted cases of Border Patrol agents chasing individuals in densely populated areas or being confronted by angry residents. Bovino has joined agents on some of those Chicago-area operations, as well as outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, where protesters have gathered for weeks.",
      "On Tuesday, Bovino was summoned before a federal judge in Chicago who has ordered his agents to limit their use of force against protesters and to generally give them two warnings before deploying chemical agents. The judge told Bovino to ensure his agents comply with the order, citing several cases of them deploying tear gas, including one incident she said affected children getting ready for a Halloween parade.",
      "Federal officials have said they've deployed tear gas in volatile situations and to protect agents. In an interview with CBS News earlier this month, Bovino said, \"the use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission.\"",
      "Border Patrol's actions have caused tensions inside DHS, where some ICE leaders feel their counterparts' operations have become too aggressive and controversial, undermining public support for Mr. Trump's mass deportation pledge, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.",
      "Though anyone found to be in the U.S. illegally is eligible to be arrested under the Trump administration, routine ICE operations are typically targeted in nature, informed by previous intelligence gathering and surveillance and aimed at arresting people in the country unlawfully who also have criminal records. ICE officials have privately argued the focus should be on arresting those with criminal records, not undertaking more indiscriminate and visible sweeps in locations like Home Depot parking lots, sources familiar with the internal deliberations told CBS News.",
      "But in a sign that top Trump administration officials think Border Patrol's aggressive style can help boost deportation levels, CBS News reported earlier this week that officials made plans to reassign roughly half of ICE's 25 field office directors and, in many cases, replace them with CBP officials.",
      "DHS, which oversees both ICE and CBP, said in a statement to CBS News Wednesday the department \"is one team and we have one fight, to secure the homeland.\"",
      "\"DHS has arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens, including rapists, murderers, and gang members, as part of DHS's Operation Midway Blitz,\" the department added.",
      "The vast majority of CBP personnel deployed to Chicago are Border Patrol agents, though some officers from its Office of Field Operations branch are also there. As federal immigration officers, Border Patrol agents, like ICE officers, have the authority to stop people they suspect are in the U.S. illegally anywhere in the country, though they have heightened search and seizure powers near border areas.",
      "Matt Hudak, who started at the Border Patrol in the late 1990s until retiring as deputy chief in 2023, said the way the Trump administration has deployed Border Patrol agents to U.S. cities is \"unique,\" though he emphasized their nationwide immigration authorities.",
      "Hudak said the administration is increasingly turning to Border Patrol for interior immigration enforcement because the agency has roughly 20,000 agents \u2014 significantly more than ICE's team of fewer than 6,000 deportation officers. Border Patrol is also no longer facing a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, where government figures show illegal crossings have plummeted to a 55-year low after soaring to record highs under the Biden administration.",
      "But Hudak said Border Patrol agents can also operate in a \"faster-paced\" and more \"forward-leaning\" way compared to ICE officers, whose approach to arrests is \"methodical\" and slower. That distinction, he said, could give them an edge in an administration heavily invested in increasing the number of immigration arrests and deportations.",
      "\"It's just like a baseball game, right?\" Hudak said. \"If you're not getting the scoring, the game's not going the way you want, you look at another head coach, or you change pitchers during the game to get that different result.\"",

      "\"And I'd be allowed to do whatever I want,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But we haven't chosen to do that because we're very well \u2014 we're doing very well without it. But I'd be allowed to do that, you understand that, and the courts wouldn't get involved, nobody would get involved, and I could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, I can send anybody I wanted. But I haven't done that because we're doing so well without it.\"",
      "The president touted the National Guard deployments in Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, as the administration insists their presence is driving down crime. The president has generally targeted Democratic-led cities for National Guard deployments. The cities of Chicago and\u00a0D.C.\u00a0and the states of Illinois, California and Oregon have sued the administration over the deployments.",
      "The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions. But there are exceptions to the law.",
      "\"He is talking about the Insurrection Act, which allows use of federal military forces in a law enforcement capacity,\" said Geoffrey Corn, director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University School of Law, in an email to CBS News. \"This is very rarely used.\"",
      "The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was in 1992, when GOP Gov. Pete Wilson of California asked President George H.W. Bush for help in quelling the Los Angeles riots, after a jury acquitted four White police officers who were accused of assaulting and beating Rodney King, a Black motorist. The incident was caught on video.",
      "\"He would have to invoke the provision allowing use of the military to assist in enforcing federal law unless a governor requested the help,\" Corn said of Mr. Trump.",
      "In D.C., Mr. Trump deployed the D.C. National Guard troops under a section of federal law known as Title 32, meaning they're not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. Members of the D.C. Guard also deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Gray Davis was the governor of California in 1992, but it was his predecessor, Pete Wilson, who was the California governor at the time and asked President George H.W. Bush for help in quelling the Los Angeles riots. This report has been updated.",

    "summary": "The Senate voted on Wednesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Canada.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Wednesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Canada, a day after the chamber rebuked the president with another vote to block tariffs on Brazil.",
      "In a 50 to 46 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with their party to vote in favor of the resolution, which required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "For months, trade tensions have flared between the U.S. and Canada. In August, the president raised tariffs on the country to 35%, though a large share of goods remain exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Then, over the weekend, Mr. Trump said he is raising tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%, blasting the U.S.'s northern neighbor over an anti-tariff ad by the government of Ontario that used quotes from former President Ronald Reagan.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more\" to combat \"drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, forced a vote to challenge the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, effectively bypassing Senate leadership. He has argued that the tariffs on one of the nation's top trading partners aren't justified under the emergency.",
      "\"I don't think you can say that fentanyl is not an emergency vis-a-vis Mexico or China, but it is ridiculous to say that fentanyl is an emergency with respect to Canada,\" Kaine said. \"And it's a pretext that's just being used to pour more and more tariffs onto Canada.\"",
      "The vote came after the Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Wednesday's vote also marked the second time lawmakers have weighed in on the Canada tariffs, after the Senate approved a resolution aimed at blocking the levies in April.",

    "summary": "The new site is intended to \"help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
    "story": [
      "A former high-ranking homeland security official in the first Trump administration is launching a new online hub Wednesday to facilitate protests and other resistance efforts against President Trump and his policies.",
      "Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, is leading a group of dozens of former national security officials, whistleblowers and a bipartisan group of former elected officials to create a website called defiance.org.",
      "In its mission statement, the bipartisan group says the tool is \"designed to help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News, \"There are many organizations and a million efforts, but there has not been a clearinghouse for people who regularly seek ways to engage. This is a 'Google' for defiance, where people can go to see their options to push back lawfully, peacefully and defiantly.\"",
      "In September 2018, Taylor wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times that said there was a \"quiet resistance\" to President Trump within his own administration, made up of people \"working diligently\" to block what he called the president's \"worst inclinations.\" He disclosed two years later that he had written the op-ed.",
      "The announcement of the new site is intended to capitalize on momentum from the October \"No Kings\" rallies earlier this month, which attracted participants across the country.",
      "The site launched Wednesday with a video of actor Robert DeNiro, a staunch Trump critic, urging protesters and critics to join forces.",
      "\"You can't just sit on your ass and wait for the insanity and cruelty to pass. No,\" DeNiro says in the video. \"You gotta stand up and fight.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, \"Further proof that Miles Taylor's entire identity is being a TDS clown. If he actually cared about workers being paid and families receiving benefits, he would urge Democrats to reopen the government \u2013 just like the President has been doing. Democrats could end the shutdown today but Myles (sic) is too blinded by his TDS rage to accept the truth.\" (\"TDS\" is often used by Mr. Trump and his supporters as an initialism for \"Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" a phrase describing some of his critics)",
      "In April, Mr. Trump signed an executive memo targeting Taylor, accusing him of manufacturing stories to sell a book, and ordered DHS, the Justice Department and other government agencies to investigate him and revoke his security clearances, as well as for those who worked closely with him. Mr. Trump also ordered an investigation into the alleged dissemination of classified documents while Taylor worked for the government. Taylor denies he leaked any such material.",
      "Defiance.org is described in its mission statement as a \"nationwide 'mutual aid' pact to defend those under attack.\" It aims to support nonprofit partners, and says it will join \"peaceful protests and legal defense efforts.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News supporters of the effort include Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary from the first Trump administration, and former aide Olivia Troye, both of whom have become vocal critics of the president.",
      "Dozens of former elected leaders and Trump critics, including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman and Joe Walsh, are also supporting the new portal.",
      "Taylor said the mutual aid feature of the portal is intended to help those targeted by the administration. He said a future effort could include rallying legal, political and community leaders to support Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is under investigation by the Justice Department, if he is charged. Taylor said the Defiance.org hub would be used to galvanize and organize legal help, courthouse supporters and public statements in support of Schiff or against the Trump administration.",
      "Riggleman told CBS News the group would seek to \"protect Americans against political overreach and targeted retaliation.\"",
      "The White House has harshly criticized Taylor in the past, including in this statement in April.",
      "\"While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the federal government that 'vowed' to undermine and render effective (sic) a sitting President,\" the White House said.",

      "Some of these firms appear to be trying to lower their profiles (in some cases, literally, on social media) amid the sometimes vitriolic online reaction to the East Wing demolition and construction of the 90,000 square-foot, privately-financed ballroom. None of the firms have been accused of any legal wrongdoing.",
      "EAI Rolloff, a Maryland-based hauling company, has advised visitors to its homepage that the site is \"Undergoing Routine Maintenance.\" There are no links or contact information listed.",
      "It's not clear when the site was taken offline or why, but an archived version from earlier this year gives customers options to learn about the company's services, contact the firm or read about its history.",
      "\"We are honest, ethical, responsive, professional and diligent,\" the company's archived \"core values\" page said.",
      "Late last week, a red and charcoal gray truck bearing the EAI logo and phone number delivered discarded rebar from the White House to a scrap yard just outside Washington. The company did not respond to emails and a phone call seeking comment.",

      "ACECO's website is also unavailable. \"This Site Is Under Construction,\" it says in bold block lettering. As recently as August, according to the Internet Archive, ACECO's site showed off the firm's work at the University of Maryland and heralded its clients, which included Clark Construction, the construction contractor hired to build the White House ballroom.",
      "Social media profiles for the company and its leadership are no longer active. WTOP reported that ratings website Yelp \"temporarily disabled the posting of content to the page for ACECO\" because of hostility directed at the company.",
      "One Yelp poster wrote, \"How do you sleep at night when all of America hates you?\"",
      "Representatives for ACECO \u2014 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "When President Trump announced the project this summer, he named McCrery Architects as the lead design firm. As recently as April, McCrery's site was robust, displaying the firm's prior design projects, its approach to architecture and staff biographies, according to an archived version of the page maintained by the Internet Archive.",
      "Now, McCrery's website is limited to a single page with a rotating photo, generic email address and phone number. Renderings of the White House ballroom are included in the photo carousel.",
      "When CBS News called the number listed on the firm's website, the phone rang several times before a recorded message said the voicemail was full. A McCrery spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Not all companies have shunned attention brought on by their association with the ballroom.",
      "Websites for Clark Construction and AECOM, the lead engineering firm, appear to be intact. Both are large companies \u2014 Clark has a national footprint and AECOM is a multinational company valued at $17 billion and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.",

      "But that bill is still five votes short of the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the Senate, and after more than a dozen rounds of voting, no additional Democrats have budged.",

      "Asked what he's doing to end the shutdown, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, accused Republicans of having misplaced priorities.",
      "\"It's extraordinary that Republicans have been able to find $40 billion to bail out a right-wing wannabe dictator in Argentina, but can't find a dime to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" said Jeffries, referring to a plan by the Trump administration to offer loans and financial support to Argentinian President Javier Milei's government.",

      "\"I have voted over 13 times to open the government with a clean continuing resolution, and when the Democrats were in control, I voted to open the government with a clean continuing resolution,\" said Lummis, who also noted that she's supported piecemeal bills to fund parts of the government. \"So the question you're asking should be asked of the Democrats, because they are in control of how this goes.\"",
      "Raskin: Republicans should return to D.C.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland took a swipe at House Republicans, who have kept the chamber out of session since the shutdown began.",
      "\"Everything we've been doing here, and the whole reason that we're in Washington, even though the Republicans are not, is to demand that they come back, reopen the government, restore health care to everybody, and get past this crisis,\" Raskin said.",
      "House GOP leaders argue they don't need to return because the chamber has already passed a continuing resolution to keep the government open, and it's up to the Senate to follow suit.",
      "Raskin represents scores of federal workers in the D.C. suburbs who have faced missed paychecks and the threat of layoffs during the shutdown. He said he's \"fighting to oppose all the violations of the rights of federal workers, to make sure that people are paid fairly, and people are not fired unfairly outside of the requirements of the civil service.\"",
      "Hawley: \"This has reached the point of insanity\"",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said he expects to keep voting to reopen the government \u2014 and asked Democrats, \"Do you want 42 million people to go without food?\"",
      "\"This has reached the point of insanity,\" Hawley said. \"Why are Americans having to suffer because of the political games?\"",
      "The senator has called for Congress to pass his standalone bill to restore funding for SNAP benefits. He said he's \"available to talk to anybody who wants to talk on any subject.\" Senate Democrats have also introduced a measure to fully fund SNAP and WIC, the Women, Children and Infants nutritional program, for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "Takano: It's up to the American people",
      "Democratic Rep. Mark Takano of California said he's focused on communicating the stakes of the impasse to the American public.",
      "\"We're doing all we can to make sure the American people understand the stakes and the power to end the shutdown is in the American people,\" he said, saying people should understand that Democrats support \"cutting costs\" and \"protecting health care.\"",
      "Takano also pushed Republicans to come to the negotiating table.",
      "Johnson: \"I'm actually optimistic\" federal workers will get paid",
      "Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said \"there's really no place to negotiate,\" arguing that the GOP has \"started from the most reasonable position\" by pushing for a clean bill to reopen the government.",
      "His focus is on passing the Shutdown Fairness Act, which would guarantee pay for essential federal employees who are still reporting to work during the shutdown.",
      "Johnson added that he's open to Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen's proposal to pay all federal workers, including those who have been furloughed, or sent home without pay.",

Many turn to medical professionals from abroad to fill the gaps, but the new $100,000 price tag for the popular H-1B visa is making that nearly impossible, particularly for midsize hospitals or smaller.",
      "\"We need to stabilize,\" said Jamie White, the chief nursing officer at Frederick Health in Maryland. She also said, \"We have had a continual desire to bring on about 100 nurses for the last three years.\"",
      "Frederick Health, like others nationwide, looked abroad to fill in the gaps, planning to sponsor up to 45 nurses on H-1B visas. Now, those plans are on hold, with a new $100,000 fee to obtain the visa and hire foreign employees.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday fired all six sitting members of a board that oversees architecture in Washington, D.C., CBS News has confirmed, as the president plans a slate of major building projects in the capital city \u2014 including a massive White House ballroom.",
      "\"We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump's America First Policies,\" a White House official told CBS News.",
      "The Commission of Fine Arts had six members, all of whom were appointed during former President Joe Biden's term. Their ouster is not without precedent: The Biden administration replaced at least six members of the commission who were named during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "The firings come as Mr. Trump seeks to put his stamp on D.C., with plans to replace the White House's East Wing with a 90,000-square-foot ballroom and build a gigantic triumphal arch across the river from D.C. He also signed an executive order in August titled \"Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again,\" which called for classical architecture modeled on ancient Greece and Rome to be the default style for D.C.-area buildings moving forward.",
      "The Commission of Fine Arts is one of several boards that reviews, provides comments on and approves construction in the capital, along with the National Capital Planning Commission. Mr. Trump picked three new members of the latter commission in July, including Chair William Scharf, a White House aide.",
      "It's not clear whether the White House intends to submit its ballroom plans to the Commission of Fine Arts, which has overseen some prior White House projects. A White House official told CBS News last week that the plans will be submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission.",
      "Mr. Trump's construction kick has drawn a polarizing response. The sudden decision to demolish the East Wing last week \u2014 despite Mr. Trump's earlier claim that the ballroom project would not touch the existing building \u2014 has faced criticism, and some historic preservation groups have urged the Trump administration to go through the normal approval process for the ballroom project.",
      "\"This project represents one of the most substantial alterations to the White House in modern history,\" Democratic Reps. Jared Huffman, Robert Garcia and Yassamin Ansari said in a letter to the president. \"The decisions were made in complete secrecy and undertaken without public disclosure or proper consultation.\"",
      "The White House, meanwhile, has called the pushback \"manufactured outrage\" and argued that prior presidents have also made changes to the complex. The administration has also cast the ballroom as a necessary addition to a building that's lacking in large event spaces.",
      "At a dinner earlier this month to thank private donors to the $300 million ballroom project, Mr. Trump marveled at how easily he was able to kick off construction.",

    "summary": "Officials from half the states and the District of Columbia are asking a federal judge to order the Department of Agriculture to provide food stamp benefits for November.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A coalition of officials from half of the states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over the suspension of food stamp benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown, as millions of Americans brace for a disruption in federal food aid in the coming days.",
      "The states, which include California, New York and Pennsylvania, are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Department of Agriculture to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u00a0for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",
      "They argue that the administration's decision to cut off food stamp payments, which are provided to roughly 42 million people nationwide, is unlawful and threatens to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The states involved in the suit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\u202fRhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.",
      "As the government shutdown continues to drag on, the Trump administration announced last week that federal food aid would not go out on Nov. 1 after the Department of Agriculture declined to tap into roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the food stamp program flowing.",
      "The agency blamed Democrats for failing to back a House-passed stopgap bill to fund the government, writing on its website that \"the well has run dry.\"",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" a spokesperson for the USDA said in response to the lawsuit. \"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"",
      "The agency's plan for a lapse in funding, issued Sept. 30, said that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits in the event\" of a funding lapse.",
      "But a memo from the USDA issued last week said \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits\" and are instead meant for things like assisting people in disaster areas. The document cited Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded.",
      "Still, state officials argued in their lawsuit that the USDA's claim that the contingency funds can't be used to fund food benefits during a lapse in federal funding violates the text of congressional appropriations law and is a \"dramatic change\" in its own policy.",
      "They noted that during the last shutdown, USDA said in guidance in January 2019 that said that \"limited funding is available from the contingency that can be used to provide benefits for February.\"",
      "\"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running. There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"",
      "The Trump administration has attempted to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to reopen the government, announcing cancellations of federal funding for programs in blue states and issuing layoff-notices to thousands of federal workers.",
      "The ongoing shutdown, which is in its 28th day, is now the second-longest on record.",
      "Ahead of the approaching halt to food stamp payments, some states have said they will work to keep the assistance going to beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps, and recipients receive, on average, a payment of $187 on prepaid cards that can be used to buy groceries.",
      "The impending lapse in food stamps has raised concerns among Republicans and Democrats. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced legislation last week that aims to ensure continued funding for the food assistance program during the shutdown. The plan has garnered support from 10 other Republican senators and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont.",
      "Democrats have separately urged Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to use the agency's reserve funds to help cover food stamp benefits next month, though she has declined to do so.",

      "Mr. Trump, speaking later to the leaders gathered for the dinner, indicated there were still some details to nail down, saying the U.S. and South Korea had \"pretty much finalized a trade deal,\" and adding that the negotiating teams \"came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"",
      "The two countries\u00a0announced\u00a0a framework deal over the summer similar to the one signed earlier in the week with Japan, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "An end to the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "But a direct meeting with China's Xi in South Korea on Thursday is the most hotly anticipated part of his trip. The foreign ministry in Beijing confirmed on Wednesday that a sit-down was planned, saying Xi would meet with Mr. Trump in Busan, \"to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest.\"",
      "Officials in Beijing have not yet voiced the same optimism publicly over a looming deal to end the trade war, and the meeting could be tense, as China and the U.S. have clashed for months, imposing reciprocal tariffs and restrictions on the import and export of key items.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to press Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements from China, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace. He had threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting from Saturday unless Beijing backs off.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0that the additional\u00a0100% tariffs\u00a0\u2014 which would boost the total U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports to 140% \u2014 were \"effectively off the table\" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.",
      "The trade war has led China to halt purchases of U.S. soybeans, causing pain for American farmers, though Bessent said Sunday that he\u00a0expects Beijing to end its soybean boycott.",
      "Mr. Trump also\u00a0needs Chinese approval\u00a0for a deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations from Beijing-based parent company ByteDance.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0predicted\u00a0earlier this week that the two leaders will reach an agreement by the end of his trip, saying he has \"a lot of respect for President Xi\" and, \"I think we're going to come away with a deal.\"",
      "Nicholas Burns, a Biden-era U.S. ambassador to China, told CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that Wednesday's meeting is \"very important,\" calling the trade war a \"test of wills\" between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "\"China is the most important competitor, adversary of the United States worldwide now. It will be in the future,\" Burns said. \"So the stakes are high, because we have lots of issues where we are competing with China.\"",
      "Trump addresses U.S. partners in Asia",
      "The president also used his speech at the APEC event to tout the other trade deals he's inked in Asia. He highlighted his plans to partner with other countries on key industries including shipbuilding, semiconductors and critical minerals, and framed the trade negotiations as an extension of the U.S. defense alliances in the region, telling audience members that \"economic security is national security.\"",
      "APEC is a regional economic group with 21 member countries around the Pacific Rim, including China, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam. Promoting free trade is a major component of the forum, despite Mr. Trump's push for higher tariffs on many member countries, a strategy that the president argues is necessary to rebalance trade.",
      "Critics warn his strategy could lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president is looking to cinch a trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner. Over the summer, Mr. Trump announced a framework deal that involves the U.S. charging 15% tariffs on South Korean goods, while South Korea invests billions in U.S. industry and opens its market to American cars. Bessent told reporters the South Korea deal is unlikely to be resolved this week, but it's close.",
      "During his APEC remarks, Mr. Trump called South Korea \"a cherished American friend and a close ally.\" He said he's looking to work with the country on investments in U.S. shipbuilding.",
      "Before leaving his previous stop in Japan, Mr. Trump signed a trade deal\u00a0on Tuesday with new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, cementing 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by the president. Japan also pledged $550 billion in investments in U.S. industry.",
      "The president announced trade framework agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand earlier in the trip.",
      "He's also expected to meet at some point with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as the microchip giant\u00a0partners\u00a0with the Department of Energy to build an artificial intelligence supercomputer and presses for\u00a0more access\u00a0to China's market.",
      "No meeting planned with Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he would be open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip, though no such meeting has been planned.",
      "The president said Wednesday that the timing couldn't be worked out for a sit-down with Kim. North Korea's government has made no comment on Mr. Trump's suggestions of another face-to-face meeting between the leaders.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, he became the\u00a0first sitting president to visit North Korea, a trip that happened after\u00a0he put an invitation to Kim\u00a0on social media.",
      "Gyeongju, where Mr. Trump was for the APEC summit, is in southeast South Korea, on the opposite side of the country as the capital Seoul, and far from the border with North Korea. The two Koreas have remained technically at war since 1953, when the Korean War was halted by an armistice rather than a full treaty.",
      "Mr. Trump said Wednesday that he would still see what could be done to get the Korean conflict \"straightened out.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 21:23:08 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump recently said a \"patriot,\" reported by the New York Times to be Timothy Mellon, donated $130 million in an effort to keep troops paid during the shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, President Trump announced an anonymous \"patriot\" had given a donation of $130 million\u00a0 \u2014 money the president said was to be used to help pay troops during the government shutdown.",
      "There are questions about the legality of a donation of this sort (the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from exceeding congressional appropriations or accepting voluntary services). Over the weekend, The New York Times identified the anonymous donor as Timothy Mellon, a reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon family fortune.",
      "Mellon, 83, emerged as one of the top Republican donors only in the past few years, giving far less in the decades before 2017.",
      "Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance researcher, told CBS News, \"Timothy Mellon was a relatively unknown political donor but his contributions have surged in recent years, putting him in the very top ranks of political contributors.\"",
      "Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income inequality and the environment. As Mellon's business career evolved, he began to express a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business. One turning point seems to be when he ran afoul of environmental regulators in Connecticut in the late 1990s over an airport he bought.",
      "He's written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some insight into his political views. Mellon wrote that a favorite quote of his came from Winston Churchill: \"Show me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains.\"",
      "Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here are some numbers associated with Mellon:",
      "At least $197 million: How much Mellon donated to Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election",
      "Mellon may be an obscure figure to the wider public, but he's well known in political circles for giving more than virtually any other donor to Mr. Trump and other Republican committees during the 2024 election cycle \u2014 at least $197 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The only person who gave more was SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.",
      "He emerged on the political scene as a megadonor relatively late in life. Over two decades, from 1996 to 2017, he gave a total of $350,000 in donations to political candidates. But in the four years between January 2020 and June 2024 he gave $227 million to federal candidates and political committees.",
      "Last year, Mellon made a $50 million donation to a Trump-affiliated super PAC, one of the largest individual contributions ever made public. That was one of several donations to the super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, totaling around $150 million. He also contributed $13 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a voter turnout super PAC that used to be affiliated with Heritage Action, the sister organization of the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "$25 million: How much Mellon gave to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign",
      "Mellon also gave $25 million to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 2024 presidential campaign. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Mr. Trump, whom he was also backing financially.",
      "But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy. Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. \"I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing.\"",
      "He began giving to Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, which promotes false information about vaccines, and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy's campaign.",
      "$14.1 billion: The Mellon family's estimated wealth",
      "Timothy Mellon, the grandson of banker and industrialist Andrew Mellon, was estimated by Forbes to be worth about $1 billion last year, though he told Forbes in an email at the time that he was not a billionaire, writing, \"never have been, never will be.\" The estimated wealth of his family, including other branches, was estimated in 2024 by Forbes to be $14.1 billion.",
      "340: The number of trees he cut down at a Connecticut airport he bought",
      "One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he purchased an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages.",
      "$53 million: How much he donated to build a border wall in Texas",
      "In 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Texas would build its own border wall and started his own private fund to build it. He made little progress \u2014 the Texas Tribune said his effort had slowed after raising a little over $1 million, and then Mellon chipped in $53 million. The private and public effort was quietly dropped earlier this year, as the GOP-led legislature defunded construction in June, and the crowdfunding link disappeared in late May, the Tribune reported. The state built about 65 miles of wall out of the 805 miles that Abbott planned, and it's riddled with gaps because many landowners do not want the border wall on their land.",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Mellon contributed $13 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a super PAC affiliated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which produced\u00a0Project 2025. But the group was founded as part of its sister organization, Heritage Action for America in 2022. In 2023, the Sentinel Action Fund relaunched as a separate super PAC. The story has been updated.",

Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the second strike. Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the third strike. A total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes, with one survivor. All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed.\"",
      "He added: \"These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate passed a measure that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, after Democrats drew support from a handful of Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted on Tuesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure in a rebuke to the president.",
      "Led by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, the resolution would terminate the national emergency that the administration is using to impose 50% tariffs on goods from Brazil.",
      "The vote to approve the measure was 52 to 48. Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul joined Democrats to vote in favor. The resolution required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil\" that he said constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup in 2022.",
      "\"President Trump's tariff regime \u2014 global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted \u2014 have created huge chaos in the national economy,\" Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was \"unusual and extreme,\" and accused him of putting it in place due to the \"decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend.\"",
      "\"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations,\" Kaine said.",
      "The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that \"the president is responsive to things like this.\"",
      "\"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,\" he said.",
      "One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years \u2014 including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.",
      "\"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,\" McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. \"The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.",
      "\"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first,\" Vance told reporters after the meeting. \"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country. They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The president cited a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in his order imposing the Brazil tariffs. The act gives any senator the authority to force a vote to challenge the move, effectively bypassing Senate leadership.",
      "In April, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve a measure aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs. Those Republicans were Murkowski of Alaska, Collins of Maine and McConnell, along with Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who cosponsored the legislation. Later that month, an effort aimed at blocking Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world fell short, with two senators who had previously backed the tariff measure absent from the vote. The resolutions need a simple majority to pass.",
      "Kaine said he would force additional votes on Canadian tariffs and global tariffs throughout the week as he pushes back on the administration and puts pressure on Senate Republicans.",
      "\"So the votes are about tariffs, and they're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about, how much will we let a president get away with?\" Kaine said. \"Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?\"",

      "\"It's disheartening to be forced to go against your community members and your neighbors,\" said Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek, a Latina guardswoman and state legislative candidate from Illinois's 13th District. \"It feels illegal. This is not what we signed up to do.\"",
      "Both Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha, who is running for Congress in the same district, described growing unease among Guard members after the White House federalized 500 troops \u2013 including members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard \u2013 to secure federal immigration facilities and personnel in the Chicago area.",
      "\"I signed up to defend the American people and protect the Constitution,\" Blaha said. \"When we have somebody in power who's actively dismantling our rights \u2014 free speech, due process, freedom of the press \u2014 it's really hard to be a soldier right now.\"",
      "Refusing a lawful federal order while serving in the National Guard can sometimes result in court-martial, imprisonment, or a felony-level discharge, depending on who issued the order, whether the soldier is under state or federal control and the nature of the disobedience. When contacted by CBS News, the Defense Department declined comment.",
      "Palecek says members of military are \"being used as pawns\"",
      "Asked if she would refuse a direct order to deploy to Chicago, Palecek didn't hesitate. \"Absolutely. I would definitely say no,\" she said. \"I'm not going to go against my community members, my family and my culture. I believe this is the time to be on the right side of history.\"",
      "\"Look at 1930s, 1940s Germany,\" Blaha said. \"There is a point where if you didn't stand up to the Gestapo, are you just actively one of them now?\"",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday delayed the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago indefinitely, until a final ruling is issued or the Supreme Court rules on the matter.",
      "The two guardsmen accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the military against civilians under the guise of public safety. \"They're definitely being used as pawns,\" Palecek said.",
      "Blaha agreed, saying most Guard units \"train to fight and win our nation's wars,\" and they do not assist law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"We're not trained to assist ICE and help them just be violent in our communities,\" he said, calling it \"shameful.\"",
      "The pair noted that Guard members currently mobilized in Illinois are on 29-day orders \u2014 too short to qualify for full benefits. \"They're not even getting paid right now because of the government shutdown,\" Blaha added. \"Most don't want to be there. They're scared, too.\"",
      "Lt. Col. Brad Leighton, a spokesperson for the Illinois National Guard later clarified that \"the approximately 300 Illinois Army National Guard Soldiers who were federalized in Illinois are on initial 60-day orders,\" allowing those service members to be eligible for health coverage as well as additional allowances to offset the cost of meals and housing.",
      "Fears for immigrant service members",
      "Roughly 200 green card holders serve in the Illinois National Guard \u2013 with 160 legal permanent residents in the state's Army National Guard and 30 in the state's Air National Guard.",
      "\"They're in sheer panic,\" Palecek said. \"They're choosing between standing up for their community or losing everything \u2014 their legal status, their path to citizenship.\"",
      "U.S. federal law generally prohibits undocumented immigrants from enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. But for green card holders, military service can help expedite U.S. citizenship under longstanding federal programs.",
      "Programs like Parole in Place exist to protect family members of service members from deportation and help them adjust status, but participants say applications have been slowed or outright denied in recent months, leaving families in legal limbo.",
      "\"I applied for parole in place,\" Palecek told CBS News. \"And [my application] has not been able to go through.\"",
      "\"Everyone says, 'Why don't they do it the right way?'\" Palecek continued, offering a sentiment often voiced by those condemning illegal immigration. \"But they are doing it the right way,\" Palecek said.",
      "Retribution in their ranks",
      "Both Blaha and Palecek said they've faced retaliation for speaking publicly. Blaha disclosed that his security clearance was suspended by the Defense Department after posting a viral video urging soldiers to disobey unlawful orders. \"They twisted my words,\" he said. \"I have about 30 days in order to provide them with a written response.\"",
      "Retribution, Palecek added, is \"real.\" She's received death threats since denouncing the deployments and launching her political campaign. \"It weighs on you mentally after a while,\" she said.",
      "Still, both say silence is not an option. \"We were trained to stand up for what we believe in and stand up for the American people,\" Blaha said.",
      "\"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else.\"",
      "Palecek, who once served in active duty, said the current mission has made her ashamed of her uniform. \"I've been truly proud of what I've been able to do in the military,\" she said. \"And right now I hate saying I'm in the military. It's embarrassing.\"",
      "Both see a dangerous precedent in deploying federal troops to U.S. cities. \"It's a slow normalization of using the military in American cities,\" Blaha said. \"If he declares martial law enough times, people will start to think it's OK.\"",
      "A majority of Americans oppose Mr. Trump's deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities as part of his crime crackdown, according to a September CBS News poll. But still, roughly 42% of Americans polled expressed support for sending members of the National Guard to cities nationwide.",
      "A CBS News analysis of FBI and Chicago Police Department data from 2024 found Chicago's violent crime is down double-digit percentage points so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Among American cities with populations of 100,000 or more, Chicago ranks 80th overall for violent crime per capita.",
      "When asked to describe what America looks like with a federalized National Guard presence nationwide, Blaha replied: \"Unsafe.\" Palecek offered: \"Disgusting.\"",
      "\"They're coming after communities that have built this country,\" Palecek added. \"To be used against my culture, my community, my neighbors \u2014 that's vile and disgusting to me.\"",
      "The two soldiers say they're speaking out to warn the rest of the country. \"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else,\" Blaha said. \"We need to combat the misinformation and stand up to Donald Trump. Crime is down. This is not about safety \u2014 it's about control.\"",

      "Hurricane Melissa has left dozens dead and widespread destruction across Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba, as it continues to threaten the Bahamas and Bermuda.",
      "Melissa made landfall over eastern Cuba early Wednesday, near the city of Chivirico, as an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 3 storm, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. On Tuesday, it\u00a0pummeled Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Melissa's core was about 65 miles east of the central Bahamas and about 860 miles southwest of Bermuda, according to the hurricane center. It had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, making it a Category 1 storm, and was moving northeast at about 16 mph.",
      "It was expected to move over the southeast or central Bahamas Wednesday evening and pass near Bermuda late Thursday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Officials across the parts of the Caribbean already hit by Melissa were assessing the storm's impacts. At least 23 people have died in Haiti and 13 are missing, the country's Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. At least four deaths were reported in Jamaica, and one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Jamaica rushes to assess the damage",
      "In Jamaica, more than 25,000 people were packed into shelters Wednesday and more streamed in throughout the day after the storm ripped roofs off their homes and left them temporarily homeless. Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister, said 77% of the island was without power.",
      "Outages complicated assessing the damage because of \"a total communication blackout\" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director-general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station.",
      "Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement that teams are working to rescue people and bring relief where it's needed the most.",
      "\"Recovery will take time, but the government is fully mobilized,\" he said. \"Relief supplies are being prepared, and we are doing everything possible to restore normalcy quickly.\"",
      "Officials in Black River, Jamaica, a coastal town of approximately 5,000 people in the southwestern part of the island, pleaded for aid at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing,\" Mayor Richard Solomon said.",
      "Solomon said the local rescue infrastructure had been demolished by the storm. The hospital, police units and emergency services were inundated by floods and unable to conduct emergency operations. The storm also destroyed the facility where relief supplies were being stored.",
      "In southwest Jamaica, David Muschette, 84, sat among the rubble of his roofless house. He said he lost everything as he pointed to his wet clothes and furniture strewn across the grass while part of his roof partially blocked the road.",
      "\"I need help,\" he begged.",
      "The government said it hopes to reopen Jamaica's airports as early as Thursday to ensure quick distribution of emergency relief supplies.",
      "The United States is sending rescue and response teams to assist in recovery efforts in the Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said\u00a0in a social media post. He said government officials were coordinating with leadership in Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas.",

      "St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto told Nationwide News Network on Wednesday that authorities have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica. One death was reported in the west when a tree fell on a baby, state minister Abka Fitz-Henley told Nationwide News Network.",
      "Before landfall, Melissa had already been blamed for three deaths in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Cuba rides out the storm",
      "People in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes on Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier.",
      "\"Life is what matters,\" Alexis Ramos, a 54-year-old fisherman, said as he surveyed his destroyed home and shielded himself from the intermittent rain with a yellow raincoat. \"Repairing this costs money, a lot of money.\"",
      "Local media showed images of the Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Hospital with severe damage: glass scattered across the floor, waiting rooms in ruins and masonry walls crumpled on the ground.",
      "\"It has been a very complex early morning,\" President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel wrote on X. \"As soon as conditions allow, we will begin the recovery. We are ready.\"",
      "The hurricane could worsen Cuba's severe economic crisis, which has already led to prolonged power blackouts along with fuel and food shortages.",
      "Cuba's National Institute of Hydraulic Resources reported accumulated rainfall of 15 inches in Charco Redondo and 14 inches in Las Villas Reservoir.",
      "Moving toward the Bahamas",
      "Melissa began affecting the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, said. Authorities in the Bahamas were evacuating dozens of people from the archipelago's southeast corner ahead of Melissa's arrival.",
      "\"The storm is growing in size,\" Brennan said, noting that tropical storm-force winds now extend almost 200 miles from the center.",
      "Melissa's center is forecast to move through the southeastern Bahamas later Wednesday, generating up to 7 feet of storm surge in the area. By late Thursday, Melissa is expected to pass just west of Bermuda.",

The storm was restrengthening as it approached eastern Cuba, the NHC said, and was expected to make landfall there as an extremely dangerous major hurricane early Wednesday morning.",
      "The storm initially came ashore Tuesday near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica, and was traveling northeast at 9 mph, the center said.

      "\"We've been working on these species for decades ... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",
      "The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.",
      "According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes.",
      "Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species' populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing.",
      "\"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have long debated whether dinosaurs were in decline before an\u00a0asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago, causing mass extinction.",
      "New research suggests dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike, but it's only one piece of the global picture, independent experts say.",
      "\"Dinosaurs were quite diverse and now we know there were quite distinct communities\" roaming around before being abruptly wiped out, said Daniel Peppe, a study co-author and paleontologist at Baylor University.",
      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within the mudstone of the rock formation.",
      "The results show \"the animals deposited here must have been living close to the end of the Cretaceous,\" the last dinosaur era, said Peppe.",
      "The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Differences between the dinosaur species found in New Mexico and those found at a site in Montana that were previously dated to the same time frame \"run counter to the idea that dinosaurs were in decline,\" Peppe said.",
      "The fossils previously found at the New Mexico site include Tyrannosaurus rex and a Triceratops-like horned herbivore.",
      "The biggest dinosaur examined in the study was the plant-eating Alamosaurus, which could weigh more than 30 tons and measure about 100 feet long.",
      "\"Nothing illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving up to the very end more than the fact that Alamosaurus, one of the biggest dinosaurs ever - in fact, one of the very biggest animals to ever live on land in the entire history of the Earth - was there to witness the asteroid,\" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte told the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"So not only were sauropods still around when the asteroid hit, they were still thriving, still sublime, still colossal, still glorious,\" Brusatte told Reuters. \"I can imagine the scene: one minute, a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid.\"",
      "A research team in 2019 found that the steroid strike ignited a chaotic day of fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis, which led to a prolonged period of global cooling.",
      "Scientists who weren't involved in the study cautioned that evidence found at a single location might not point to a broader trend.",
      "\"This new evidence about these very late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is very exciting,\" said University of Bristol paleontologist Mike Benton, who was not involved in the study. But he added, \"This is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world.\"",
      "Although scientists have found dinosaur fossils on every continent, accurately dating them can be a challenge, said paleontologist and study co-author Andrew Flynn of New Mexico State University. Easily datable material, such as carbon, doesn't survive in fossils, so scientists must look for surrounding rocks with precise characteristics that can be used to determine ages.",
      "Further research might help complete the picture of what range of dinosaur species was alive globally on the eve of the asteroid crash, said Flynn.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:05:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa\u00a0was heading toward the Bahamas on Wednesday after hitting eastern Cuba and\u00a0Jamaica. Melissa was\u00a0one of the strongest hurricanes\u00a0ever recorded in the Atlantic basin when it reached Jamaica on Tuesday afternoon as a Category 5 storm.",
      "Its wind speeds have slowed since its landfalls in Jamaica and Cuba, with 90 mph winds recorded Wednesday, making it a Category 1 hurricane, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.",
      "Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "As of its latest update Wednesday, the hurricane center said Melissa's core was about 65 miles east of the central Bahamas and about 860 miles southwest of Bermuda.",
      "\"The core of Melissa is expected to move across the southeastern or central Bahamas this afternoon and evening, and pass near or to the west of Bermuda late Thursday and Thursday night,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "Melissa was moving at about 16 mph. Hurricane-force winds extended out up to 60 miles from Melissa's center and tropical storm-force winds extended out up to 185 miles, the NHC said.",
      "The storm made landfall in Cuba early Wednesday as a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. Before that, it slammed Jamaica's southwestern coast Tuesday afternoon, packing maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, the hurricane center said. Hurricanes reach Category 5 \u2014 the top of\u00a0the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0\u2014 when their winds hit 157 mph.",
      "The storm's extremely slow pace as it hit Jamaica raised its potential destructive force.",
      "The strongest previous hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",
      "The crew of a U.S. Air Force 403rd Wing \"Hurricane Hunters\" flight ran into severe turbulence as it approached Melissa's eyewall on Monday and had to return to their base in Florida, but they did capture stunning images of the center of the storm. Another flight on Tuesday to gather data on the hurricane also had to turn back after hitting strong turbulence.",
      "Hurricane advisories",
      "A hurricane warning was in effect Wednesday for the southeastern and central Bahamas, as well as Bermuda.",
      "And a tropical storm warning is posted the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "Rainfall forecasts",
      "Rainfall of 5 to 10 inches was expected in the southeast Bahamas on Wednesday, \"which will result in areas of flash flooding,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "In the Turks and Caicos, rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected, and heavy rain was forecast to affect Bermuda on Thursday or Thursday night.",
      "Climate change fueling the storm",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.",
      "\"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now \u2014 around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,\" Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. \"And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.\"",
      "Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise will make storm surge more intense.",
      "Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change has increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph.",
      "\"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,\" Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told the AP.",

    "summary": "A jury found former Sangamon County deputy Sean Grayson guilty of second degree murder for the fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey, but her family said the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.",
    "story": [
      "A jury found former Sangamon County deputy Sean Grayson guilty of second-degree murder for the fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey.",
      "Grayson was charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the 2024 deadly police shooting, and the jury was given the option of convicting him of second-degree murder. They found him not guilty on all three counts of first-degree murder.",
      "The jury alerted the judge that they had reached a verdict around 2 p.m.\u00a0 It was read at 2:28 p.m.",
      "Grayson was stoic as the verdict was read. Afterward, he stood from the table, put his hands to be handcuffed, and was led out of the courtroom through the back door. His sentencing date has been set for Jan. 29 in Sangamon County court.",
      "One of Grayson's family members was seen crying in the courtroom when the verdict was read.",
      "Massey's family, by contrast, was quiet and appeared deflated or upset as the second-degree conviction was handed down. They spoke after court adjourned, and called the conviction a miscarriage of justice.",
      "\"I am fueled by rage right now,\" said Sontae Massey. \"You get an officer who says, 'I'm going to shoot you in the face' and you only get second-degree murder. The justice system did what it's supposed to do; it's not meant for us.\"",
      "Massey's father, James Wilburn, couldn't fathom the idea that his daughter was the aggressor as Grayson's attorneys stated during the trial.",
      "\"Who could've imagined in their wildest dreams that my daughter was the aggressor here,\" Wilburn said. \"Unless we can't believe our lying eyes, he said what he was going to do, and he did it. He did it.\"",
      "CBS News Chicago legal expert Irv Miller said the jury's verdict was not particularly surprising, considering the evidence presented at trial and the fact that the judge gave the option for second degree murder in the first place.",
      "Miller explained that by finding Grayson guilty of second-degree murder, the jury determined that as a police officer he had an unreasonable belief that he was acting in self-defense when he opened fire on Massey. In this case, Miller said, whether or not Grayson's belief he was acting in self-defense was reasonable was pivotal; if a jury had found it was a reasonable belief, he would have been found not guilty. Since the jury found his belief was not reasonable, they found him guilty of second degree murder.",
      "Miller said he expects whatever sentence is handed down, Grayson will be expected to serve at least 50% of it. While probation is an option, Miller said he wouldn't expect that sentence in this case.",
      "Attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, who represent the Massey family in their civil lawsuit, issued a statement after the verdict, saying in part, \"While we believe Grayson's actions deserved a first-degree conviction, today's verdict is still a measure of justice for Sonya Massey. Accountability has begun, and we now hope the court will impose a meaningful sentence that reflects the severity of these crimes and the life that was lost. We will continue to fight for Sonya's family and for reforms that protect everyone from unlawful use of force.\"",
      "Crump and Romanucci also thanked the Sangamon County State's Attorneys Office and State's Attorney John C. Milhiser for their work on the case.",
      "The jury deliberated\u00a0for more than 11 hours over the course of two days before they reached their verdict. They asked several questions and to see Grayson's previous employment and training history. They also re-watched the body camera footage after closing arguments on Tuesday.",
      "Massey, a 36-year-old unarmed Black woman, called police for help in July 2024 for a possible prowler outside her home.",
      "Inside the home, Grayson said Massey began acting erratically and rebuked him \"in the name of Jesus\" while walking towards a pot of water on her stove. Body cam video from Grayson's partner captured the shooting; Grayson's body camera was not activated for most the call, only turning on shortly after he pulled his weapon.",
      "Massey died of a gunshot wound. Grayson faces three first-degree murder charges.",
      "Dawson Farley, his former partner on that night, testified during the trial that he was not afraid of Massey during the call, but instead feared Grayson. Farley told the jury that, while he was confused after Massey said \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" he never perceived that as a threat. He added he only unholstered his gun because Grayson did.",
      "Grayson took the stand in his own defense. He testified that finding broken windows on her car, her 911 call for help and waiting four minutes for her to answer the phone made him concerned someone else was inside. He also said he believed she may have been \"under the influence of something\" and said she appeared \"scatterbrained.\"",
      "He also testified that he perceived Massey holding the pot of hot water from the stove as a threat.",

      "As an IT specialist, 37-year-old Korey Wallace is used to offering support to others. But he says he was the one who needed help after serving on a jury for a murder trial in Philadelphia.",
      "The jury ultimately convicted a man accused of first-degree murder in the killing of a 27-year-old transgender woman. Investigators found her dismembered body in a river near a park that Wallace used to frequent.",
      "\"There would be nights where I was just driving around the city and I might make eye contact with a transgender person as I'm in the car. It's just like a lightning strike. I thought I was over it, moving past it, and I was getting dumped back in these flashes,\" Wallace said.",
      "Jurors were shown gruesome pictures of bloody crime scenes. Wallace said he never saw the victim's face until after the trial.",
      "\"The first thing I saw was her face and the eyes and the hair and it struck me. This woman that was full of life was so savagely murdered,\" Wallace said.",
      "Across the country, 11 million people report for jury duty each year. Less than half a million will serve on violent criminal cases, including murder. But counseling and mental health services offered to jurors after those verdicts are rare.",
      "Philadelphia Jury Commissioner Patrick Martin wants to change that. He set out to create a program to help jurors handle trauma.",
      "\"I'm pulling regular people off the street \u2014 a deli worker, a plumber, a librarian. They don't know what they're really getting into when they come down for jury service,\" Martin said.",
      "He added, \"The jurors are mine. They're my responsibility. Not just when they get the summons in the mail, but when they go home.\"",
      "Martin partnered with psychologist Michele Pole at West Chester University to come up with a plan. Grad students, who are trained by Pole, offer at least three free support sessions to jurors. They use a technique called psychological first aid.",
      "\"It's not any different from what first responders receive,\" Pole said. \"And what we've done with psychological first aid is really to focus on where do we customize this for jurors?\"",
      "The program launched in April, and Wallace was one of the first jurors to take advantage.",
      "\"She helped me kind of disconnect that web of yarn that had all those conflicting emotions associated with it. I would not have been able to do that without her,\" Wallace said.",

      "The crash happened approximately 100 miles from the state capital of Jackson. It's not clear what caused the truck to overturn. Video showed monkeys crawling through the tall grass on the side of Interstate 59 just north of Heidelberg, Mississippi, with wooden crates labeled \"live animals\" crumpled and strewn about.",
      "The Jasper County Sheriff's Department said the rhesus monkeys were from Tulane University, and initially wrote in a post on Facebook that \"they are aggressive to humans and they require PPE to handle.\"",
      "The department later said on Facebook that \"[t]here are 3 monkeys still on the loose after the officials from Tulane were able to get inside the truck and get a correct count.\"",
      "It's not clear how many monkeys were originally in the truck or how many were killed.",
      "The sheriff's department said the driver of the truck relayed that \"the monkeys were dangerous and posed a threat to humans,\" and that it took \"appropriate actions after being given that information.\"",
      "Rhesus monkeys, which typically weigh around 16 pounds, are among the most medically studied animals on the planet.",
      "The sheriff's department initially said the monkeys were carrying diseases, including herpes, but Tulane University said in a statement that the monkeys \"are not infectious.\" Law enforcement officials did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for clarification.",
      "The monkeys were being housed at the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, which routinely provides primates to scientific research organizations, according to the university.",
      "The monkeys \"are provided to other research organizations to advance scientific discovery,\" a Tulane University spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"The primates in question belong to another entity and are not infectious. We are actively collaborating with local authorities and will send a team of animal care experts to assist as needed.\"",
      "\"The primates in question were not carrying any diseases and had received recent checkups confirming that they were pathogen-free,\" Tulane spokesperson Andrew Yawn said in another statement on Wednesday.",
      "Mississippi Wildlife and Fisheries was also on site, according to the sheriff's department. It wasn't clear who the monkeys belong to or where they were going.",
      "Rhesus macaque primates have brown fur with red faces and ears. They have close-cropped hair on their heads, which accentuates their very expressive faces. Rhesus macaques were imported to the United States in the 1970s for biomedical research in laboratories, according to the\u00a0New England Primate Conservancy. Rhesus macaques are \"bold, extremely curious and adventurous monkeys,\" and the species is \"highly adaptable to coexisting alongside humans,\" the conservancy says.",
      "In November 2024, 43 rhesus macaque primates escaped from an Alpha Genesis research facility in Beaufort County, South Carolina, prompting warnings for nearby residents to secure their doors and windows. They were all eventually safely captured as of January.

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 19:04:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The move, if it occurs, would be in response to China's escalating hostilities near disputed waters as Trump is poised to meet with Xi, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As the highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping was set to take place in South Korea Thursday, the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command quietly issued an order this week to stage a \"show of force\" against recent Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, CBS News has learned.",
      "It's unclear when this operation would occur, if at all, as military operations can easily be canceled at the last minute, but the execute order from Indo-Pacific Command, the Defense Department's oldest and largest combatant unit overseeing operations across half the globe, directed American forces to carry out a precision strike demonstration in response to China's escalating hostilities near disputed waters. Two other sources confirmed that the operation had been prepared as an option, but they said the plan was unlikely to be executed.",
      "If launched, it's unclear what the HIMARS would target but the operation is intended to signal Washington's intent to push back against Beijing's expanding presence in the region and defend what U.S. officials describe as Philippine sovereignty and long-standing fishing rights.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, no reply has been returned from U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.",
      "The High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, delivers its greatest impact against fixed targets that can be located and struck with precision, such as ammunition depots or clusters of troops. Built by defense contractor Lockheed Martin, the system saw extensive use in the post-9/11 Iraq and Afghanistan wars and is prized by Ukraine in its fight against Russia.",
      "Scarborough Shoal, known in the Philippines as Bajo de Masinloc, sits within Manila's exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea, but Beijing has controlled access to the reef since a tense 2012 standoff between the two nations who both claim ownership of the shoal.",
      "China's presence there has grown steadily as its coast guard and maritime flotilla of ships regularly shadow or harass Philippine vessels and small fishing boats. In Sept. 2024, a\u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0crew witnessed China's naval aggressiveness while onboard a Philippine Coast Guard ship that was rammed by a Chinese coast guard vessel. The Philippine ship was on a mission to resupply ships and stations in the South China Sea at the time but was forced to abandon its first stop as Chinese vessels surrounded it.",
      "Recent high-resolution satellite photos released earlier this month shows what appears to be a floating barrier at the mouth of Scarborough reef. Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Ray Powell, a maritime analyst and director of SeaLight, a Stanford University-affiliated analysis group, posted the photographs captured by Satellogic on X and said China was responsible for installing the barrier.",
      "Both China and the Philippines have installed and later dismantled temporary barriers around the Scarborough Shoal before. One U.S. official said ideally, the operation by Indo-Pacific Command should occur ahead of the U.S.-China trade negotiations or before China establishes a more permanent barrier at the Scarborough reef.",
      "In August, a Chinese Coast Guard ship and a Chinese Navy vessel collided near the reef while pursuing a Philippine Coast Guard cutter. Weeks later, Beijing announced plans to create a \"nature reserve\" in the area \u2014 a move that was condemned by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and viewed by officials in Manila as another step toward solidifying Chinese control.",
      "\"Beijing claiming Scarborough Reef as a nature preserve is yet another coercive attempt to advance sweeping territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea at the expense of its neighbors, including by preventing Filipino fishermen from accessing these traditional fishing grounds,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"China's actions at Scarborough Reef continue to undermine regional stability.\"",
      "Speaking before fellow leaders of the Association of South East Asian Nations and Mr. Trump on Sunday in Kuala Lumpur, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., echoed Rubio's comments from September and condemned China, without directly naming it, for encroaching on Philippine sovereignty in its push for a \"nature reserve\" in Scarborough Shoal.",
      "\"The attempt of some actors to establish the so-called 'nature reserve' status over Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Shoal, which is a long-standing and integral part of the Philippines over which it has sovereignty and jurisdiction, clearly violates not only Philippine sovereignty, but also the traditional fishing rights of our people,\" said Marcos, who added that China is violating international law. He cited the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 Award on the South China Sea arbitration which rejected China's claims of historic rights over the territory.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump told reporters Wednesday that he has the authority to send U.S. military forces beyond the National Guard into U.S. cities, claiming not even the courts could stop him, but said that hasn't been necessary so far.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One during his trip to Asia, the president said he could send the \"Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,\" and \"anybody I wanted\" into U.S. cities, and would do so \"if I thought it was necessary.\" Earlier in his trip, the president told U.S. troops at the Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo that he was prepared to send \"more than the National Guard\" into U.S. cities if needed.",
      "Asked whether he meant sending other branches of the military into U.S. cities, Mr. Trump said Wednesday, \"You know if I want to enact a certain act, I'm allowed to do it routinely,\" an apparent reference to the Insurrection Act, which allows the military to act in a law enforcement capacity to suppress a rebellion or quell domestic violence. The authority that has not been invoked by a U.S. president in more than 30 years.",
      "\"And I'd be allowed to do whatever I want,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But we haven't chosen to do that because we're very well \u2014 we're doing very well without it. But I'd be allowed to do that, you understand that, and the courts wouldn't get involved, nobody would get involved, and I could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, I can send anybody I wanted. But I haven't done that because we're doing so well without it.\"",
      "The president touted the National Guard deployments in Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, as the administration insists their presence is driving down crime. The president has generally targeted Democratic-led cities for National Guard deployments. The cities of Chicago and\u00a0D.C.\u00a0and the states of Illinois, California and Oregon have sued the administration over the deployments.",
      "The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions. But there are exceptions to the law.",
      "\"He is talking about the Insurrection Act, which allows use of federal military forces in a law enforcement capacity,\" said Geoffrey Corn, director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University School of Law, in an email to CBS News. \"This is very rarely used.\"",
      "The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was in 1992, when GOP Gov. Pete Wilson of California asked President George H.W. Bush for help in quelling the Los Angeles riots, after a jury acquitted four White police officers who were accused of assaulting and beating Rodney King, a Black motorist. The incident was caught on video.",
      "\"He would have to invoke the provision allowing use of the military to assist in enforcing federal law unless a governor requested the help,\" Corn said of Mr. Trump.",
      "In D.C., Mr. Trump deployed the D.C. National Guard troops under a section of federal law known as Title 32, meaning they're not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. Members of the D.C. Guard also deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Gray Davis was the governor of California in 1992, but it was his predecessor, Pete Wilson, who was the California governor at the time and asked President George H.W. Bush for help in quelling the Los Angeles riots. This report has been updated.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Wednesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Canada, a day after the chamber rebuked the president with another vote to block tariffs on Brazil.",
      "In a 50 to 46 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with their party to vote in favor of the resolution, which required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "For months, trade tensions have flared between the U.S. and Canada. In August, the president raised tariffs on the country to 35%, though a large share of goods remain exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Then, over the weekend, Mr. Trump said he is raising tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%, blasting the U.S.'s northern neighbor over an anti-tariff ad by the government of Ontario that used quotes from former President Ronald Reagan.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more\" to combat \"drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, forced a vote to challenge the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, effectively bypassing Senate leadership. He has argued that the tariffs on one of the nation's top trading partners aren't justified under the emergency.",
      "\"I don't think you can say that fentanyl is not an emergency vis-a-vis Mexico or China, but it is ridiculous to say that fentanyl is an emergency with respect to Canada,\" Kaine said. \"And it's a pretext that's just being used to pour more and more tariffs onto Canada.\"",
      "The vote came after the Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Wednesday's vote also marked the second time lawmakers have weighed in on the Canada tariffs, after the Senate approved a resolution aimed at blocking the levies in April.",

      "A former high-ranking homeland security official in the first Trump administration is launching a new online hub Wednesday to facilitate protests and other resistance efforts against President Trump and his policies.",
      "Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, is leading a group of dozens of former national security officials, whistleblowers and a bipartisan group of former elected officials to create a website called defiance.org.",
      "In its mission statement, the bipartisan group says the tool is \"designed to help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News, \"There are many organizations and a million efforts, but there has not been a clearinghouse for people who regularly seek ways to engage. This is a 'Google' for defiance, where people can go to see their options to push back lawfully, peacefully and defiantly.\"",
      "In September 2018, Taylor wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times that said there was a \"quiet resistance\" to President Trump within his own administration, made up of people \"working diligently\" to block what he called the president's \"worst inclinations.\" He disclosed two years later that he had written the op-ed.",
      "The announcement of the new site is intended to capitalize on momentum from the October \"No Kings\" rallies earlier this month, which attracted participants across the country.",
      "The site launched Wednesday with a video of actor Robert DeNiro, a staunch Trump critic, urging protesters and critics to join forces.",
      "\"You can't just sit on your ass and wait for the insanity and cruelty to pass. No,\" DeNiro says in the video. \"You gotta stand up and fight.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, \"Further proof that Miles Taylor's entire identity is being a TDS clown. If he actually cared about workers being paid and families receiving benefits, he would urge Democrats to reopen the government \u2013 just like the President has been doing. Democrats could end the shutdown today but Myles (sic) is too blinded by his TDS rage to accept the truth.\" (\"TDS\" is often used by Mr. Trump and his supporters as an initialism for \"Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" a phrase describing some of his critics)",
      "In April, Mr. Trump signed an executive memo targeting Taylor, accusing him of manufacturing stories to sell a book, and ordered DHS, the Justice Department and other government agencies to investigate him and revoke his security clearances, as well as for those who worked closely with him. Mr. Trump also ordered an investigation into the alleged dissemination of classified documents while Taylor worked for the government. Taylor denies he leaked any such material.",
      "Defiance.org is described in its mission statement as a \"nationwide 'mutual aid' pact to defend those under attack.\" It aims to support nonprofit partners, and says it will join \"peaceful protests and legal defense efforts.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News supporters of the effort include Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary from the first Trump administration, and former aide Olivia Troye, both of whom have become vocal critics of the president.",
      "Dozens of former elected leaders and Trump critics, including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman and Joe Walsh, are also supporting the new portal.",
      "Taylor said the mutual aid feature of the portal is intended to help those targeted by the administration. He said a future effort could include rallying legal, political and community leaders to support Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is under investigation by the Justice Department, if he is charged. Taylor said the Defiance.org hub would be used to galvanize and organize legal help, courthouse supporters and public statements in support of Schiff or against the Trump administration.",
      "Riggleman told CBS News the group would seek to \"protect Americans against political overreach and targeted retaliation.\"",
      "The White House has harshly criticized Taylor in the past, including in this statement in April.",
      "\"While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the federal government that 'vowed' to undermine and render effective (sic) a sitting President,\" the White House said.",

      "Stocks erased modest gains after Powell's comments, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.2% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping 0.4%.",
      "The central bank's move to ease monetary policy is aimed at shoring up economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, spurring consumer spending and investment by businesses. Although the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has delayed release of the Labor Department's September jobs report, other indicators point to a continued slowdown in hiring. The ADP National Employment Report, for instance, showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 last month.",
      "In its policy\u00a0statement on Wednesday, the Fed said \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting last month that risks to the labor market are growing.",
      "While Powell said the Fed is watching layoff announcements from large businesses such as Amazon, he added that the weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating. His comments indicate that another back-to-back rate cut this year isn't a certainty, financial experts said.",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn't a sure thing,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email. Investors \"were negatively surprised that future cuts might be taken off the table.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the panel that sets the Fed's monetary policy, isn't scheduled to meet on interest rates in November.",
      "Data blackout",
      "The near-total blackout on government economic data during the shutdown may complicate the Fed's decision-making, experts said. Typically, Fed officials are able to draw on a host of official reports, ranging from measures of employment growth to inflation markers, as they seek to determine the best path for policy.",
      "\"While today's rate cut and the general direction of future policy remain relatively clear, guidance on the committee's perspective on economic conditions is more necessary than ever,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"A prolonged government shutdown and ongoing tariff negotiations continue to introduce significant uncertainty into the immediate monetary policy outlook.\"",
      "Powell noted that the lack of official economic data may complicate the Fed's December decision, given that the central bank relies on such information to assess the economy.",
      "\"What do you do when you are driving in the fog? You slow down,\" Powell said.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 FOMC members voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, with two members objecting. Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, preferring a 0.50 percentage point cut, as he did at the September meeting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffry Schmid also dissented, saying he preferred no rate change.",
      "Inflation battle",
      "While the Fed is now focused on weakness in the labor market, its battle against inflation isn't over. The Fed cranked rates higher after consumer prices soared during the pandemic, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Because higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, businesses and consumers typically react by paring spending, which dampens demand throughout the economy and cools inflation. Since mid-2022, inflation has receded to an annual rate of 3% as of September, although that remains higher than the Fed's target of a 2% annual pace.",
      "While the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs are starting to trickle through to consumer prices, the impact has been more muted than economists had predicted earlier this year. Some businesses are eating some of the tariff costs, while others stocked up on imports earlier in the year to get ahead of the import duties.",
      "\"Though inflation is still higher than comfortable, the jobs market is holding on to signs of weakness, and their desire to stimulate the economy further is likely to continue outweighing inflation concerns,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at financial services company TruStage.",

      "The prospect of job cuts has hovered over Paramount employees for some time. Ellison on Wednesday reiterated that the company has been working to restructure since the completion of its merger in August, and noted that workforce cuts are \"part of that process.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge Michael Seabright ruled that acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, who oversees the Justice Department's outpost in the Central District of California, cannot oversee the prosecutions of three people who were charged with gun crimes. The judge rejected a request by the three defendants to toss out their charges altogether.",
      "Essayli \u2014 a former California Republican state lawmaker \u2014 was named interim U.S. attorney in April, a role that's typically limited to just 120 days.

      "Seabright ruled that this maneuver was unlawful because only the first assistant U.S. attorney who is already in place when the office becomes vacant is eligible to become acting chief.",
      "\"Simply stated: Essayli unlawfully assumed the role of Acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California. He has been unlawfully serving in that capacity since his resignation from the interim role on July 29, 2025,\" Seabright wrote. \"Essayli may not perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney as Acting United States Attorney. He is disqualified from serving in that role.\"",

      "In several states, the Trump administration has sought to keep federal prosecutors in temporary roles for months.

    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

      "Jeffries also blasted the Trump administration over the expected end to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits on Saturday, saying Republicans \"can't find a dime to make sure that 42 million Americans, including 16 million children, don't go hungry.\"",

      "House GOP leaders argue they don't need to return because the chamber has already passed a continuing resolution to keep the government open, and it's up to the Senate to follow suit.",
      "Raskin represents scores of federal workers in the D.C. suburbs who have faced missed paychecks and the threat of layoffs during the shutdown. He said he's \"fighting to oppose all the violations of the rights of federal workers, to make sure that people are paid fairly, and people are not fired unfairly outside of the requirements of the civil service.\"",
      "Hawley: \"This has reached the point of insanity\"",

    "story": [
      "Sorry, parents and teachers of middle schoolers: your days of hearing \"67\" shouted randomly are far from over.",
      "Dictionary.com on Wednesday announced it has chosen \"67\" \u2014 pronounced \"six seven,\" not sixty-seven \u2014 as its 2025 Word of the Year.",
      "67 is an ambiguous slang term made popular by Gen Alpha on social media and in schools and friend groups across the country. Its pervasiveness is what stuck out to the team selecting the word of the year, Steve Johnson, director of lexicography for the Dictionary Media Group at IXL Learning, told CBS News.",
      "\"Something that you would have thought would have gone away, it just kept on growing larger and larger, snowballing into kind of like a cultural phenomenon,\" Johnson said.",
      "Johnson knew they had \"something really interesting\" when he got a message from his friend, a middle school teacher, early one morning saying, \"Do not make six seven word of the year.\"",
      "\"I was just like, 'Oh, teachers have found this,'\" he said.",
      "Reactions to the term, and its selection as word of the year, are sure to be divided by generation.",
      "\"This is really a new generation flexing their linguistic muscles and making a pretty phenomenal impact on the English language,\" Johnson said. \"That's something to be celebrated and cheered.\"",
      "But for anyone older, \"especially ones that have to deal with the shouting of 'six seven' out of nowhere on a day-to-day basis, I think there's going to be a mixture of like groans and a lot of like, 'Well, this tracks,'\" he said.",
      "What does 67 mean?",
      "67 is different from previous words of the year because is doesn't have a concrete meaning.",
      "\"This is really the first word of the year that we've had in a really long time that's actually more of an interjection,\" Johnson said. \"It's something that people are just shouting and saying, and that in itself is pretty novel and pretty spectacular.\"",
      "Some say it means \"so-so\" or \"maybe this, maybe that,\" since it is sometimes said with both palms facing up and moving alternately up and down, but it remains largely nonsensical, the Dictionary.com definition says.",
      "\"Because of its murky and shifting usage, it's an example of brainrot slang and is intended to be nonsensical and playfully absurd,\" the dictionary says.",
      "It's also a group identity marker or symbol of belonging, Johnson said.",
      "\"It's something that's used to show, 'I'm part of this generation. This is who I am.' It's kind of like an in-group joke,\" he said.",
      "The origin of 67",
      "The term originated from a song by rapper Skrilla, \"Doot Doot (6 7),\" which was then use on video clips of NBA players including LaMelo Ball, who's 6 feet 7 inches.",
      "\"Viral clips on TikTok and Instagram paired the song 'Doot Doot (6 7)' with basketball visuals as far back as October 2024,\" Dictionary.com said.",
      "It became a meme and continued to spread among young audiences. Just recently, it made it into a \"South Park\" episode.",
      "For Johnson, he's watching where the term goes from here.",

      "Hospitals nationwide are urging the Trump administration to reconsider a steep new fee for hiring highly skilled workers from other countries. Many turn to medical professionals from abroad to fill the gaps, but the new $100,000 price tag for the popular H-1B visa is making that nearly impossible, particularly for midsize hospitals or smaller.",
      "\"We need to stabilize,\" said Jamie White, the chief nursing officer at Frederick Health in Maryland. She also said, \"We have had a continual desire to bring on about 100 nurses for the last three years.\"",
      "Frederick Health, like others nationwide, looked abroad to fill in the gaps, planning to sponsor up to 45 nurses on H-1B visas. Now, those plans are on hold, with a new $100,000 fee to obtain the visa and hire foreign employees.",
      "\"We cannot afford that for even one individual,\" White said.",
      "The Trump administration announced the policy change in September, with President Trump saying it provides an incentive to hire American workers. The administration has since clarified that the fee is for new applicants living abroad, not those already here.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers called the administration's actions a necessary reform.",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages,\" Rogers said in a recent statement to CBS News.",
      "Frederick Health and other hospitals are hoping for an exemption for medical workers, given an ongoing national shortage.",
      "\"I know there's a lot of concern with bringing people to the United States, and they might be taking U.S. jobs, but we do have a shortage of clinical team and highly skilled workers,\" White said.",
      "The American Hospital Association wrote the Trump administration a letter in late September asking for exemptions for health care personnel. The letter\u00a0detailed the association's concerns\u00a0and said that\u00a0rural\u00a0and underserved communities could be hit hardest.",
      "\"Given the staffing and financial challenges our hospitals are already facing, the increased petition fees outlined in the September 19 Proclamation would likely prevent many of them from continuing to recruit essential health care staff and could force a reduction in the services they are able to provide,\" said the letter, addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on the letter when contacted by CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday fired all six sitting members of a board that oversees architecture in Washington, D.C., CBS News has confirmed, as the president plans a slate of major building projects in the capital city \u2014 including a massive White House ballroom.",
      "\"We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump's America First Policies,\" a White House official told CBS News.",
      "The Commission of Fine Arts had six members, all of whom were appointed during former President Joe Biden's term. Their ouster is not without precedent: The Biden administration replaced at least six members of the commission who were named during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "The firings come as Mr. Trump seeks to put his stamp on D.C., with plans to replace the White House's East Wing with a 90,000-square-foot ballroom and build a gigantic triumphal arch across the river from D.C. He also signed an executive order in August titled \"Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again,\" which called for classical architecture modeled on ancient Greece and Rome to be the default style for D.C.-area buildings moving forward.",
      "The Commission of Fine Arts is one of several boards that reviews, provides comments on and approves construction in the capital, along with the National Capital Planning Commission. Mr. Trump picked three new members of the latter commission in July, including Chair William Scharf, a White House aide.",
      "It's not clear whether the White House intends to submit its ballroom plans to the Commission of Fine Arts, which has overseen some prior White House projects. A White House official told CBS News last week that the plans will be submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission.",
      "Mr. Trump's construction kick has drawn a polarizing response. The sudden decision to demolish the East Wing last week \u2014 despite Mr. Trump's earlier claim that the ballroom project would not touch the existing building \u2014 has faced criticism, and some historic preservation groups have urged the Trump administration to go through the normal approval process for the ballroom project.",
      "\"This project represents one of the most substantial alterations to the White House in modern history,\" Democratic Reps. Jared Huffman, Robert Garcia and Yassamin Ansari said in a letter to the president. \"The decisions were made in complete secrecy and undertaken without public disclosure or proper consultation.\"",
      "The White House, meanwhile, has called the pushback \"manufactured outrage\" and argued that prior presidents have also made changes to the complex. The administration has also cast the ballroom as a necessary addition to a building that's lacking in large event spaces.",
      "At a dinner earlier this month to thank private donors to the $300 million ballroom project, Mr. Trump marveled at how easily he was able to kick off construction.",
      "\"They said, 'Sir, you can start tonight,\" the president \u2014 no stranger to real estate development \u2014 told attendees. \"'You have zero zoning conditions. You're the president.'\"",

      "Nvidia's shares rose $9.08, or 4.5%, to $210.11 in early morning trading, lifting its market capitalization to $5.1 trillion. The company crossed the new threshold less than four months after it had reached a market value of $4 trillion in July.",

      "Jurors began deliberating late Tuesday morning in the murder trial for\u00a0former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy\u00a0Sean Grayson, in the shooting death of Sonya Massey, an unarmed Black woman who had called police for help.",
      "The jury received the case following closing arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys.",
      "In court on Tuesday, prosecutors held Massey's cooking pot up for the jury and sarcastically said, \"This is the dangerous pot that Sean Grayson was so afraid of.\"",
      "Prosecutors also for the second time showed unedited camera footage in court. Massey's family was visibly emotional and upset, and a juror wiped away tears as she cried while watching the video.",
      "In July 2024, Massey called 911 to report a prowler. Grayson was among the officers who responded.",
      "During their interaction, Massey walked towards a pot of water on the stove. Massey told officers, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" before the officers pulled out their weapons, yelling for her to drop the pot. That's when Grayson shot Massey.",
      "Grayson, who faces three counts of first-degree murder, took the stand on Monday and offered his version of events. When he and his partner arrived at Massey's home in the Springfield area on July 6, 2024, Grayson's body-worn camera was not on.",
      "\"I should have turned it on when I saw the broken windows of the car outside,\" Grayson told jurors.",
      "Grayson said that the broken window, Massey's call for help, and having to wait four minutes for Massey to answer the door made him concerned that someone else could have been in the house.",
      "He also claimed, \"I believed she was possibly under the influence of something,\" and said that she appeared \"scatterbrained.\"",
      "He said he turned his camera on as he began to question her. He testified that Massey had a pot of boiling water on the stove, and told the jury that he was scared of being hit with boiling hot water inside the pot, and when Massey said \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" he perceived that as a threat and opened fire.",
      "\"I saw the bottom of the pot was turning red, so it seemed very hot,\" he said. \"Then she picked up the pot and walked towards me. \u2026 I wasn't quite sure what she was going to do.\"",
      "Grayson said Massey asked, \"Where are you going?\" and he responded, \"Away from your hot steaming water.\"",
      "\"I took it as a threat,\" he said. \"It raises a lot of concern for me, and I believe she's going to throw the water. \u2026 We were trained to use force that's going to gain compliance.\"",
      "Grayson said he was equipped with a Taser, but testified, \"She was wearing layers and both prongs have to stick in for the Taser to work.\"",
      "Grayson's attorneys during the trial called Massey the aggressor and accused her of escalating the encounter, leaving the former deputy with no other options.",
      "During closing arguments, Grayson's attorneys instructed the jury that this case is not a question of who shot and killed Massey\u2014rather, it's a question of whether or not Grayson was justified to do so under Illinois law. State prosecutors painted a picture of Grayson as a man trying to control the entire situation, but was unable to control himself and his own emotions the night he killed Massey.",
      "Jurors last week heard from Grayson's partner,\u00a0who said he wasn't afraid of Massey\u00a0but said he was afraid of Grayson.",

That's the difference between being found guilty of potentially first-degree murder and second-degree murder.\u00a0 If the belief was unreasonable, that will be second-degree murder,\" Miller said.",
      "In August,\u00a0Gov. JB Pritzker signed the Sonya Massey Bill, which requires more thorough background checks for officers in the state.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military carried out another strike on an alleged \"narco-trafficking vessel\" in the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, killing four people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said \u2014 marking at least the 15th boat to be hit in the Trump administration's two-month-long campaign of strikes that have killed more than 60 people.",
      "Hegseth posted a video of a boat strike on X. He said the strike was conducted in international waters, and alleged that the boat was operated by an unnamed designated terrorist organization. He said no U.S. forces were harmed.",
      "The military began striking alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean Sea early last month, and expanded the gambit to the Eastern Pacific in recent weeks. In some \u2014 but not all \u2014 cases, the Trump administration has said the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "The administration has vowed to continue carrying out the strikes, arguing the U.S. is in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels and gangs in Latin America, many of which the U.S. has designated as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "\"The Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans,\" Hegseth wrote Wednesday on X. \"The Department of War will continue to hunt them down and eliminate them wherever they operate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of strikes on land-based targets, saying last week, \"the land is going to be next.\"",
      "The campaign has drawn pushback from some lawmakers\u00a0who want more evidence that the targets were actually smuggling drugs and warn that it could draw the U.S. into a conflict in the region. Congress has not authorized the strikes, though the Trump administration argues it doesn't need permission from the legislature.",
      "Venezuela and Colombia have also expressed outrage over the strikes, which are part of a broader military buildup in the Caribbean, with several U.S. ships and thousands of troops deploying to the region.",
      "The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of partnering with drug traffickers \u2014 a charge he denies. A U.S. warship docked in nearby Trinidad and Tobago over the weekend, which the Venezuelan government called a \"hostile provocation.\"",

      "Hurricane Melissa has left dozens dead and widespread destruction across Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba, as it continues to threaten the Bahamas and Bermuda.",
      "Melissa made landfall over eastern Cuba early Wednesday, near the city of Chivirico, as an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 3 storm, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. On Tuesday, it\u00a0pummeled Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Melissa's core was about 65 miles east of the central Bahamas and about 860 miles southwest of Bermuda, according to the hurricane center. It had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, making it a Category 1 storm, and was moving northeast at about 16 mph.",
      "It was expected to move over the southeast or central Bahamas Wednesday evening and pass near Bermuda late Thursday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Officials across the parts of the Caribbean already hit by Melissa were assessing the storm's impacts. At least 23 people have died in Haiti and 13 are missing, the country's Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. At least four deaths were reported in Jamaica, and one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Jamaica rushes to assess the damage",
      "In Jamaica, more than 25,000 people were packed into shelters Wednesday and more streamed in throughout the day after the storm ripped roofs off their homes and left them temporarily homeless. Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister, said 77% of the island was without power.",
      "Outages complicated assessing the damage because of \"a total communication blackout\" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director-general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station.",
      "Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement that teams are working to rescue people and bring relief where it's needed the most.",
      "\"Recovery will take time, but the government is fully mobilized,\" he said. \"Relief supplies are being prepared, and we are doing everything possible to restore normalcy quickly.\"",
      "Officials in Black River, Jamaica, a coastal town of approximately 5,000 people in the southwestern part of the island, pleaded for aid at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing,\" Mayor Richard Solomon said.",
      "Solomon said the local rescue infrastructure had been demolished by the storm. The hospital, police units and emergency services were inundated by floods and unable to conduct emergency operations. The storm also destroyed the facility where relief supplies were being stored.",
      "In southwest Jamaica, David Muschette, 84, sat among the rubble of his roofless house. He said he lost everything as he pointed to his wet clothes and furniture strewn across the grass while part of his roof partially blocked the road.",
      "\"I need help,\" he begged.",
      "The government said it hopes to reopen Jamaica's airports as early as Thursday to ensure quick distribution of emergency relief supplies.",
      "The United States is sending rescue and response teams to assist in recovery efforts in the Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said\u00a0in a social media post. He said government officials were coordinating with leadership in Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas.",
      "\"Our prayers are with the people of the Caribbean,\" he wrote.",
      "St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto told Nationwide News Network on Wednesday that authorities have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica. One death was reported in the west when a tree fell on a baby, state minister Abka Fitz-Henley told Nationwide News Network.",
      "Before landfall, Melissa had already been blamed for three deaths in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Cuba rides out the storm",
      "People in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes on Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier.",
      "\"Life is what matters,\" Alexis Ramos, a 54-year-old fisherman, said as he surveyed his destroyed home and shielded himself from the intermittent rain with a yellow raincoat. \"Repairing this costs money, a lot of money.\"",
      "Local media showed images of the Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Hospital with severe damage: glass scattered across the floor, waiting rooms in ruins and masonry walls crumpled on the ground.",
      "\"It has been a very complex early morning,\" President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel wrote on X. \"As soon as conditions allow, we will begin the recovery. We are ready.\"",
      "The hurricane could worsen Cuba's severe economic crisis, which has already led to prolonged power blackouts along with fuel and food shortages.",
      "Cuba's National Institute of Hydraulic Resources reported accumulated rainfall of 15 inches in Charco Redondo and 14 inches in Las Villas Reservoir.",
      "Moving toward the Bahamas",
      "Melissa began affecting the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, said. Authorities in the Bahamas were evacuating dozens of people from the archipelago's southeast corner ahead of Melissa's arrival.",
      "\"The storm is growing in size,\" Brennan said, noting that tropical storm-force winds now extend almost 200 miles from the center.",
      "Melissa's center is forecast to move through the southeastern Bahamas later Wednesday, generating up to 7 feet of storm surge in the area. By late Thursday, Melissa is expected to pass just west of Bermuda.",

      "The storm made landfall in Cuba early Wednesday as a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. Before that, it slammed Jamaica's southwestern coast Tuesday afternoon, packing maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, the hurricane center said. Hurricanes reach Category 5 \u2014 the top of\u00a0the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0\u2014 when their winds hit 157 mph.",
      "The storm's extremely slow pace as it hit Jamaica raised its potential destructive force.",
      "The strongest previous hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",
      "The crew of a U.S. Air Force 403rd Wing \"Hurricane Hunters\" flight ran into severe turbulence as it approached Melissa's eyewall on Monday and had to return to their base in Florida, but they did capture stunning images of the center of the storm.

      "During a meeting with Mr. Trump earlier Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said he's looking for U.S. support in getting nuclear fuel for submarines. He argued that shifting away from diesel-electric submarines \u2014 which typically have more limited ranges \u2014 would allow South Korea to help the U.S. Navy patrol the region.",
      "\"We're not aiming for nuclear-armed submarines, but rather, conventionally armed submarines powered by nuclear energy,\" Lee said through a translator, saying his country's existing fleet has \"limited capabilities\" and \"cannot really effectively monitor and counter any undersea activities from other countries.\"",
      "Nuclear-powered submarines are a key part of the U.S.'s naval fleet, and the advanced technology necessary to build them is closely guarded by U.S. officials. The Biden administration inked a deal with Australia to help the country build the submarines.",
      "The move could pose concerns for the U.S. and South Korea's two mutual rivals in the region, North Korea and China.

Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday local time, for talks that are expected to focus on trade.",

      "He said the country has agreed to \"pay the USA\" $350 billion, invest in U.S. industry, and buy American oil and gas in exchange for lower U.S. tariffs on South Korean imports. Mr. Trump outlined a similar deal over the summer, which called for 15% tariffs on South Korean goods.",

      "The jewels date back hundreds of years and are considered national treasures with an estimated value of some $102 million. Experts have told CBS News the elaborate pieces of jewelry may have already been broken down into their component parts, greatly diminishing their value, and they may never be found.",

      "Castro said in a video posted on X\u00a0Tuesday that 60 criminal suspects had been \"neutralized\" during the massive raid that he called the biggest such operation in the city's history. Some 81 suspects were arrested, while 93 rifles and more than half a ton of drugs were seized, the state government said, adding that those killed \"resisted police action.\"",
      "Rio's civil police said on X that four officers died in Tuesday's operation. \"The cowardly attacks by criminals against our agents will not go unpunished,\" it said.",
      "Residents scrambled for cover and shops closed their doors amid police claims that the gangs were using drones to fight back, AFP reported.",
      "Castro posted a video on X of what he described as a gang-controlled drone launching a projectile from the cloudy sky.",
      "\"This is how the Rio police are treated by criminals: with bombs dropped by drones. This is the scale of the challenge we face. This is not ordinary crime, but narcoterrorism,\" he said.",
      "State officials said at least 50 of those killed were \"indicated by police as suspected of being criminals,\" BBC News reported. Dozens of people were injured, including civilians caught in the crossfire, according to the BBC.",
      "The United Nations' human rights body said it was \"horrified\" by the deadly police operation, called for effective investigations and reminded authorities of their obligations under international human rights law.",
      "C\u00e9sar Mu\u00f1oz, director of Human Rights Watch in Brazil, called Tuesday's events \"a huge tragedy\" and a \"disaster.\"",
      "\"The public prosecutor's office must open its own investigations and clarify the circumstances of each death,\" Mu\u00f1oz said in a statement.",
      "Footage on social media showed fire and smoke rising from the two favelas as gunfire rang out. The city's Education Department said 46 schools across the two neighborhoods were closed, and the nearby Federal University of Rio de Janeiro canceled night classes and told people on campus to seek shelter.",
      "Suspected gang members blocked roads in northern and southeastern Rio in response to the raid, local media reported. At least 70 buses were commandeered to be used in the blockades, causing significant damage, the city's bus organization Rio Onibus said.",
      "The operation Tuesday followed a year of investigation into the criminal group, police said.",
      "Gov. Castro, from the conservative opposition Liberal Party, said the federal government should be providing more support to combat crime \u2014 a swipe at the administration of leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "Gleisi Hoffmann, the Lula administration's liaison with the parliament, agreed that coordinated action was needed but pointed to a recent crackdown on money laundering as an example of the federal government's action on organized crime.",
      "Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and a number of ministers met in response to the operation on Tuesday afternoon. Chief of staff Rui Costa requested an emergency meeting in Rio on Wednesday, with him in attendance as well as Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski.",
      "Emerging from Rio's prisons, the Red Command criminal gang has expanded its control in favelas in recent years.",
      "\"Russian roulette\"",
      "Rio has been the scene of lethal police raids for decades. In March 2005, some 29 people were killed in Rio's Baixada Fluminense region, while in May 2021, 28 were killed in the Jacarezinho favela.",
      "While the Tuesday's police operation was similar to previous ones, its scale was unprecedented, said Luis Flavio Sapori, a sociologist and public safety expert at Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais.",
      "\"What's different about today's operation is the magnitude of the victims. These are war numbers,\" he said.",
      "He argued that these kinds of operations are inefficient because they do not tend to catch the masterminds, but rather target underlings who can later be replaced.",
      "\"It's not enough to go in, exchange gunfire, and leave. There's a lack of strategy in Rio de Janeiro's public security policy,\" Sapori said. \"Some lower-ranking members of these factions are killed, but those individuals are quickly replaced by others.\"",
      "The Marielle Franco Institute, a nonprofit founded by the slain councilwoman's family to continue her legacy of fighting for the rights of people living in favelas, also criticized the operation.",
      "\"This is not a public safety policy. It's a policy of extermination, that makes the everyday life of Black and poor people a Russian roulette,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Everyone is terrified\"",
      "AFP saw police in the Vila Cruzeiro neighborhood of Penha district guarding about 20 young people huddled together and sitting on the sidewalk, heads bowed, barefoot and shirtless.",
      "\"This is the first time we've seen drones (from criminals) dropping bombs in the community,\" said a Penha resident, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "\"Everyone is terrified because there's so much gunfire,\" she added.",

    "summary": "For decades, Bill Gates has warned of climate disaster \u2014 but his tone meaningfully shifted as he cautioned against taking a \"doomsday view\" on the planet's future.",
    "story": [
      "For decades, Bill Gates has warned of climate disaster \u2014 but his tone meaningfully shifted Tuesday as the billionaire Microsoft co-founder cautioned against taking a \"doomsday view\" on the planet's future.",
      "In a memo posted online, Gates wrote that while climate change is still a major problem that needs to be solved, \"People will be able to live and thrive on Earth for the foreseeable future.\" Gates, who has invested billions developing green technologies to cut greenhouse gases, says doomsday climate scenarios over-emphasize cutting emissions while \"diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world.\"",
      "The lengthy memo essentially argued that we should continue to innovate and back climate breakthroughs but not at the expense of funding for global health or development \u2014 \"programs that help people stay resilient in the face of climate change.\" He argued for putting \"human welfare at the center of our climate strategies,\" including improving health and agriculture in the world's poorest countries.",
      "In years past, Gates, the author of \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,\" struck a more alarmist tone.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in 2021, he warned: \"If we don't reduce emissions, then the death toll would be even worse near the equator, and the unrest would be global in nature.\" He added, \"You've got to start work now to avoid those terrible consequences much later.\"",
      "Gates described climate change as the most formidable challenge humanity has ever faced. He told Anderson Cooper in a \"60 Minutes\" interview that same year that climate change is \"way greater than the pandemic. And it needs a level of cooperation that would be unprecedented.\"",
      "Gates has personally invested over $2 billion in green technology and launched Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a firm formed with other billionaires to fund research and technology aimed at finding solutions to reduce carbon emissions.",
      "Gates' memo drew a mixed response. Some agreed that climate change isn't the greatest threat to humanity, while others slammed the memo for understating the consequences of climate change.",
      "Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, climate scientist and professor at Texas Tech University, says the problem of climate change cannot be separated from the other major threats that humanity faces because it contributes to them, including in the developing world.",
      "\"Just give me a list of people's top 10 things to worry about, and I can tell you how climate change is making every single one of those top 10 things worse,\" she said.",
      "Dr. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, called the memo a \"breathtaking misread\" that lacks an understanding of what it would mean for the world to experience 2 or 3 degrees Celsius of warming.",
      "\"I think it grossly misrepresents the magnitude of the consequences we're going to see, ironically, for the same people the memo claims to be looking out for \u2014 the global poor.\"",
      "Timothy Gallaudet, a retired Rear Admiral who oversaw weather forecasting for the U.S. Navy, questions some climate assessments, including doomsday scenarios.",
      "\"Ultimately, there's real impacts, but so much is reported erroneously,\" he said. \"There's so much misinformation in the climate space now, it's a real shame.\"",
      "Gallaudet believes moving away from \"climate doomsday alarmism\" and focusing on adaptation and technological improvements to forecasting is beneficial, more realistic, and practical.",
      "Ted Nordhaus is founder and executive director of global research center Breakthrough Institute (not to be confused with Gates' Breakthrough Energy). He said that climate change is a problem, but it doesn't pose the existential threat that some have cautioned.",
      "In a column for The Free Press (which, like CBS News, is owned by Paramount Skydance), Nordhaus wrote that climate tipping points like the melting of ice sheets and the deforestation of the Amazon \"don't add up to catastrophic outcomes for humanity.\"",
      "Per Nordhaus, scientific evidence doesn't suggest climate change is the greatest threat facing humanity, and it shouldn't take top consideration when the world has already proven it can adapt to a warming atmosphere.",
      "\"We've always adapted, that's why we have humans living across huge variances in climatic zones,\" he told CBS News. \"I think the point of Gates' letter is we're actually making a fair amount of progress here to reduce emissions and continuing to be more resilient.\"",
      "With the global climate summit known as COP30 coming up next month in Brazil, Gates urged world leaders, business and activists to chart a new path forward.",
      "\"This is a chance to refocus on the metric that should count even more than emissions and temperature change: improving lives,\" he wrote.",

    "story": [
      "The Israeli military said it had \"begun the renewed enforcement of the ceasefire\" in Gaza after carrying out airstrikes that it said hit \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\" in the Palestinian territory. The flare-up of violence on Tuesday sparked fears that the U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and Hamas could crumble.",
      "At least 104 Palestinians were killed in Israel's strikes, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Wednesday that it would \"continue to uphold the ceasefire agreement and will respond firmly to any violation of it.\"",
      "An Israeli military source said Tuesday that IDF forces had been operating in Rafah, southern Gaza, to dismantle tunnels when enemy fire was directed at a structure and an engineering vehicle, killing Master Sgt. (Res.) Yona Efraim Feldbaum.",
      "Shortly after, anti-tank missiles were fired at a separate armored vehicle and troops in the area, the Israeli military source said.",
      "Hamas denied any involvement in the shooting.",
      "Later Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered Israel's military to conduct \"powerful strikes\" in Gaza in response to ceasefire violations by Hamas.",
      "In response, Hamas said it would delay the return of the remains of another hostage that had been expected to take place on Tuesday.",
      "President Trump, who is on a trip to Asia, said Israel was justified in carrying out the strikes against Hamas, telling reporters on Wednesday: \"As I understand it, they [Hamas] took out an Israeli soldier, so the Israelis hit back and they should hit back. When that happens, they should hit back.\"",
      "\"Nothing is going to jeopardize\" the ceasefire, Mr. Trump added. \"You have to understand Hamas is a very small part of peace in the Middle East, and they have to behave.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Hamas accused the Israeli military of committing \"a large-scale massacre\" overnight, \"despite the agreement to halt the war.\"",
      "Israel's strikes \"reflect a clear lack of respect by the occupation government toward the mediators and guarantor states, which have failed to stop the occupation from continuing its genocidal war on the Gaza Strip,\" Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said in a statement.",

      "Their troop ship HMAT A70 Ballarat had left the South Australia state capital Adelaide to the east on Aug. 12 of that year on the long journey to the other side of the world where its soldiers would reinforce the 48th Australian Infantry Battalion on Europe's Western Front.",
      "Neville was killed in action a year later. Harley was wounded twice but survived the war, dying in Adelaide in 1934 of a cancer his family says was caused by him being gassed by the Germans in the trenches.",
      "Neville requested the bottle's finder deliver his letter to his mother Robertina Neville at Wilkawatt, now a virtual ghost town in South Australia. Harley, whose mother was dead by 1916, was happy for the finder to keep his note.",

      "Neville wrote that he and his comrades were, \"Somewhere at Sea.\" Harley wrote that they were, \"Somewhere in the Bight,\" referring to the Great Australian Bight. That's an enormous open bay that begins east of Adelaide and extends to Esperance on the western edge.",
      "Soldier's granddaughter \"absolutely stunned\"",
      "Deb Brown suspects the bottle didn't travel far. It likely spent more than a century ashore buried in the sand dunes. Extensive erosion of the dunes caused by huge swells along Wharton Beach in recent months probably dislodged it.",
      "The paper was wet, but the writing remained legible. Because of that, Deb Brown was able to notify both soldiers' relatives of the find.",
      "The bottle \"is in pristine condition. It doesn't have any growth of any barnacles on it. I believe that if it had been at sea or if it had been exposed for that long, the paper would've disintegrated from the sun. We wouldn't have been able to read it,\" she said.",

    "title": "Trump says he expects to make U.S.-China trade deal with Xi tomorrow",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-south-korea-apec-summit-xi-meeting/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 06:22:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump is in South Korea, the final stop of his Asia tour, where he says he expects to nail down a \"good deal for both\" China and the U.S. with Xi Jinping.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Wednesday in South Korea that he hoped to emerge from a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping with a U.S.-China trade deal in hand.",
      "\"We're going to be, I hope, making a deal. I think we're going to have a deal. I think it will be a good deal for both,\" the president said. \"The world is watching, and I think we'll have something that's very exciting for everybody.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a speech to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, the last major scheduled stop of a nearly weeklong swing through Asia. Much of his trip has focused on cementing trade agreements and boosting economic ties with U.S. partners in the region.",
      "Trump says U.S. and South Korea deal \"pretty much finalized\"",
      "The president has signed trade and tariff deals with Japan, Malaysia and several other countries during his trip, and after scheduled talks with South Korean officials on Wednesday, he told reporters before a formal state dinner hosted by South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung: \"We reached a deal. We had a great session. It's an honor.\"",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told reporters ahead of Mr. Trump's visit that he didn't expect a U.S.-South Korea trade agreement to be completely nailed down during the president's trip, but he said he thought it was close.",
      "Mr. Trump, speaking later to the leaders gathered for the dinner, indicated there were still some details to nail down, saying the U.S. and South Korea had \"pretty much finalized a trade deal,\" and adding that the negotiating teams \"came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"",
      "The two countries\u00a0announced\u00a0a framework deal over the summer similar to the one signed earlier in the week with Japan, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "An end to the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "But a direct meeting with China's Xi in South Korea on Thursday is the most hotly anticipated part of his trip. The foreign ministry in Beijing confirmed on Wednesday that a sit-down was planned, saying Xi would meet with Mr. Trump in Busan, \"to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest.\"",
      "Officials in Beijing have not yet voiced the same optimism publicly over a looming deal to end the trade war, and the meeting could be tense, as China and the U.S. have clashed for months, imposing reciprocal tariffs and restrictions on the import and export of key items.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to press Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements from China, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace. He had threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting from Saturday unless Beijing backs off.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0that the additional\u00a0100% tariffs\u00a0\u2014 which would boost the total U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports to 140% \u2014 were \"effectively off the table\" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.",
      "The trade war has led China to halt purchases of U.S. soybeans, causing pain for American farmers, though Bessent said Sunday that he\u00a0expects Beijing to end its soybean boycott.",
      "Mr. Trump also\u00a0needs Chinese approval\u00a0for a deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations from Beijing-based parent company ByteDance.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0predicted\u00a0earlier this week that the two leaders will reach an agreement by the end of his trip, saying he has \"a lot of respect for President Xi\" and, \"I think we're going to come away with a deal.\"",
      "Nicholas Burns, a Biden-era U.S. ambassador to China, told CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that Wednesday's meeting is \"very important,\" calling the trade war a \"test of wills\" between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "\"China is the most important competitor, adversary of the United States worldwide now. It will be in the future,\" Burns said. \"So the stakes are high, because we have lots of issues where we are competing with China.\"",
      "Trump addresses U.S. partners in Asia",
      "The president also used his speech at the APEC event to tout the other trade deals he's inked in Asia. He highlighted his plans to partner with other countries on key industries including shipbuilding, semiconductors and critical minerals, and framed the trade negotiations as an extension of the U.S. defense alliances in the region, telling audience members that \"economic security is national security.\"",
      "APEC is a regional economic group with 21 member countries around the Pacific Rim, including China, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam. Promoting free trade is a major component of the forum, despite Mr. Trump's push for higher tariffs on many member countries, a strategy that the president argues is necessary to rebalance trade.",
      "Critics warn his strategy could lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president is looking to cinch a trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner. Over the summer, Mr. Trump announced a framework deal that involves the U.S. charging 15% tariffs on South Korean goods, while South Korea invests billions in U.S. industry and opens its market to American cars. Bessent told reporters the South Korea deal is unlikely to be resolved this week, but it's close.",
      "During his APEC remarks, Mr. Trump called South Korea \"a cherished American friend and a close ally.\" He said he's looking to work with the country on investments in U.S. shipbuilding.",
      "Before leaving his previous stop in Japan, Mr. Trump signed a trade deal\u00a0on Tuesday with new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, cementing 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by the president. Japan also pledged $550 billion in investments in U.S. industry.",
      "The president announced trade framework agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand earlier in the trip.",
      "He's also expected to meet at some point with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as the microchip giant\u00a0partners\u00a0with the Department of Energy to build an artificial intelligence supercomputer and presses for\u00a0more access\u00a0to China's market.",
      "No meeting planned with Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he would be open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip, though no such meeting has been planned.",
      "The president said Wednesday that the timing couldn't be worked out for a sit-down with Kim. North Korea's government has made no comment on Mr. Trump's suggestions of another face-to-face meeting between the leaders.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, he became the\u00a0first sitting president to visit North Korea, a trip that happened after\u00a0he put an invitation to Kim\u00a0on social media.",
      "Gyeongju, where Mr. Trump was for the APEC summit, is in southeast South Korea, on the opposite side of the country as the capital Seoul, and far from the border with North Korea. The two Koreas have remained technically at war since 1953, when the Korean War was halted by an armistice rather than a full treaty.",
      "Mr. Trump said Wednesday that he would still see what could be done to get the Korean conflict \"straightened out.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as a\u00a0fearsome Category 5 storm, bringing heavy floodwaters across the country's southwest and catastrophic winds that tore roofs off buildings.",
      "The most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago and one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded, Melissa struck Jamaica with sustained winds of 185 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.",
      "Melissa weakened somewhat after landfall, with the hurricane center saying in its latest update Tuesday night that winds were at 130 mph, a Category 4 speed. The storm was restrengthening as it approached eastern Cuba, the NHC said, and was expected to make landfall there as an extremely dangerous major hurricane early Wednesday morning.",
      "The storm initially came ashore Tuesday near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica, and was traveling northeast at 9 mph, the center said. Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were already being reported earlier Tuesday as the hurricane made its approach, with officials cautioning that the damage assessment will be slow.",
      "More than 530,000 Jamaicans were without power as of Tuesday evening, according to Minister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie. A section of the roof of Black River Hospital in southwestern Jamaica was damaged by the storm, and the hospital evacuated 75 patients, McKenzie said during a news conference.",
      "Melissa was expected to continue its path over Jamaica and be over southeastern Cuba early Wednesday morning, the NHC said. It could then reach the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday, still as a hurricane.",
      "\"For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,\" World Meteorological Organization tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said. She told reporters in Geneva that she expects catastrophic damage on the island, according to the Reuters news service.",
      "Melissa could affect 1.5 million people in Jamaica, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies official Necephor Mghendi said in Geneva, warning there will be a \"massive impact,\" French news agency AFP reported.",
      "Hours before the storm, the Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare as it, too, warned of catastrophic damage.",
      "\"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. \"The question now is the speed of recovery. That's the challenge.\"",
      "Melissa is forecast to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places. \"Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,\" the hurricane center warned.",
      "\"We will get through it together,\" said Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service.",
      "For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots through Wednesday, which could result in \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected into Wednesday in the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding.",
      "A life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet is expected across southern Jamaica, with officials concerned about the impact on some hospitals along the coastline.",
      "Health Minister Christopher Tufton said some patients were relocated from the ground floor to the second floor, \"and [we] hope that will suffice for any surge that will take place.\"",
      "The storm was already blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person was missing.",
      "Colin Bogle, a Mercy Corps adviser based near Kingston, said most families are sheltering in place despite the government ordering evacuations in flood-prone communities.",
      "\"Many have never experienced anything like this before, and the uncertainty is frightening,\" he said. \"There is profound fear of losing homes and livelihoods, of injury, and of displacement.\"",
      "Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's water and environment minister, said he had more than 50 generators available to deploy after the storm, but warned people to set aside clean water and use it sparingly.",
      "\"Every drop will count,\" he said.",
      "In Cuba, a hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guant\u00e1namo, Holguin and Las Tunas provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Camaguey province.",
      "Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez said late Tuesday on social media that authorities had evacuated 735,000 people.",
      "Melissa has also drenched the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with a tropical storm warning still in effect for Haiti.",
      "A hurricane warning was also in effect for the southeastern and central Bahamas, and a hurricane watch was in effect for Bermuda. A tropical storm warning was also issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. State Department\u00a0issued natural disaster travel alerts for Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Bahamas on Monday, urging U.S. citizens to consider leaving while flights were still available, or be prepared to shelter in place.",

    "summary": "The order from Netanyahu follows heightened tensions after Hamas returned a set of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday he has ordered the army to immediately carry out \"powerful strikes\" in Gaza, and Hamas responded by saying it would delay handing over the body of a hostage, putting new pressure on the tenuous U.S.-brokered ceasefire.",
      "Associated Press reporters and witnesses heard tank fire and saw explosions in various parts of Gaza, including in Gaza City and Deir al-Balah.",
      "The order from Netanyahu follows heightened tensions, as Israel reported Hamas firing on its forces in southern Gaza and after Hamas returned a set of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war.",
      "\"This constitutes a clear violation of the\u00a0[Gaza peace] agreement\" by Hamas, Netanyahu's office said, adding that the prime minister would meet with the heads of Israel's defense establishment, \"during which Israel's steps in response to the violations will be discussed.\"",
      "In a sign of the fragility of the ceasefire, Israeli troops were shot at in the southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and returned fire, according to an Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because there hasn't been an official announcement yet.",
      "Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to South Korea, President Trump addressed the clashes, saying \"nothing's going to jeopardize\" the ceasefire.",
      "Mr. Trump said Hamas is a \"very small part of peace in the Middle East\" and that \"if they're not good, they're going to be terminated. Their lives will be terminated. and they understand that.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what happened to the Israeli soldier, but they say it was sniper fire, and [the Israeli response] was retribution for that, and I think they have a right to do that,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "There are still 13 bodies of hostages in Gaza. Hamas said Tuesday it had recovered the body of a hostage, but after Netanyahu announced the plans to strike Gaza, Hamas said in a statement it would delay the handover.",
      "An Associated Press videographer in Khan Younis witnessed what appeared to be a white body bag being carried out from a tunnel by several men, including some masked militants, and then transported into an ambulance. It was not immediately clear what was in the bag.",
      "The slow return of hostages' bodies is posing a challenge to implementing the next stages of the ceasefire, which will address even knottier issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of an international security force in Gaza and deciding who will govern the territory.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces accused Hamas Tuesday of \"attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies, while in fact holding deceased hostages whose remains it refuses to release as required by the agreement.\"",
      "The IDF said its drones had recorded Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" on Monday, and then staging \"a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"",
      "Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the bodies amid the vast destruction in Gaza, while Israel has accused the militant group of purposely delaying their return. Over the weekend, Egypt deployed a team of experts and heavy equipment to help search for the bodies of the remaining hostages. That work continued Tuesday in Khan Younis and Nuseirat.",
      "Israeli hostage negotiator and peace campaigner Gershon Baskin told CBS News earlier this month that it was \"very likely that there might be Israeli bodies underneath the rubble\" in Gaza, where the Hamas-run government estimates that at least 90% of the\u00a0buildings have been damaged or destroyed.",
      "This is the second time since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10 that remains turned over by Hamas have been problematic. Israel said one of the bodies Hamas released in the first week of the ceasefire belonged to an unidentified Palestinian.",
      "During a previous ceasefire in February 2025, Hamas said it handed over the bodies of three hostages, Shiri Bibas and her two sons, but testing showed that one of the bodies returned was identified as a Palestinian woman. Shiri Bibas' body was returned a day later.",
      "The remains returned overnight have been identified as belonging to Ofir Tzarfati, Netanyahu's office said.",
      "Tzarfati was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that started the war. In all, the militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.",
      "Tzarfati was killed in captivity and his body was retrieved by Israeli troops in November 2023. In March 2024, his family received additional remains for burial.",
      "Tzarfati's family said in a statement that this is the third time \"we have been forced to open Ofir's grave and rebury our son.\"",
      "In exchange for 15 dead hostages returned from Gaza since the ceasefire began, Israel has handed back to Gaza 195 Palestinian bodies. The last 20 living hostages were returned to Israel at the start of the ceasefire, and in exchange, Israel freed roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Israeli authorities said they had killed three Palestinian militants during an operation in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, the latest action in Israel's stepped-up military activity in the territory since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack.",
      "Israeli police said the three men were shot as they came out of a cave near Jenin, a town in the northern West Bank known as a militant stronghold. The Israeli military said in a statement that the militants \"took part in terror activity in Jenin,\" but gave no further details.",
      "Two militants were shot and killed in the initial volley of gunfire. The third, who was wounded, was killed shortly after, according to the Israeli military.",
      "An earlier statement said the Israeli military carried out an airstrike shortly afterward to destroy the cave. The army confirmed an airstrike in the area but gave no further details.",
      "Hamas condemned the Jenin strike and later identified two of the three men as militants with Hamas' Qassam Brigades. The third man was referred to as a \"comrade,\" but no additional details about him were given.",
      "Israel says its operations have cracked down on militants in the West Bank. But Palestinians and human rights groups say scores of uninvolved civilians have also been among the dead, while tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes.",
      "Over 68,500 Palestinians have died in the two-year war in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.",

Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the second strike. Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the third strike. A total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes, with one survivor. All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed.\"",
      "He added: \"These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them.\"",

      "With maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, Melissa was tied with two other hurricanes for the strongest landfall on record in the Atlantic. Hurricane Dorian in 2019 and a 1935 storm known as the Labor Day hurricane, before storms were named the way they are now, both clocked winds of 185 mph when they made landfall.",
      "Two other Atlantic storms also recorded similarly powerful winds at one point but were less extreme when they made landfall: Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.",
      "Hurricane Allen in 1980 had the strongest winds, recorded at 190 mph.",
      "A hurricane's strength is also measured by its pressure, measured in millibars. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, hurricanes typically get stronger as their pressure decreases.",

      "President Trump arrived Monday in Japan, where new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is banking on building a friendly personal relationship with the U.S. leader to ease trade tensions.",
      "Mr. Trump's Asian tour, which kicked off over the weekend, has a heavy focus on business ties, and speaking to journalists as he flew into the Japanese capital, he predicted that a U.S.-China trade agreement would be done before he returned to Washington.",
      "But first, the meeting with Takaichi will be an early diplomatic test for Japan's first woman leader. She took office only last week, and has a tenuous coalition backing her.",
      "During the flight to Tokyo, Mr. Trump came back to the press cabin on Air Force One, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. He said he'd talk about the \"great friendship\" between the U.S. and Japan during his visit.",
      "\"I hear phenomenal things\" about Takaichi, Mr. Trump said, noting her closeness with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Mr. Trump had a good relationship during his first term.",
      "\"It's going to be very good,\" he said. \"That really helps Japan and the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's only scheduled event on Monday following his arrival was a meeting at the Imperial Palace with Emperor Naruhito, Japan's ceremonial head of state. The emperor smiled and waved as Mr. Trump's limousine pulled up to the palace.",
      "They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries before smiling for a photo together, then walked inside the palace for a roughly half-hour meeting that the White House described as a \"courtesy call.\"",
      "The American leader spent Sunday in Malaysia, participating in a regional summit of Southeast Asian nations where he struck preliminary trade agreements with Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Trump says he expects trade deal with China done this week",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he expected to reach a trade agreement with China in the coming days.",
      "Officials from the world's two largest economies said Sunday that they'd reached an initial consensus for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to try to finalize during a high-stakes meeting later in the week.",
      "\"I have a lot of respect for President Xi,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"I think we're going to come away with a deal,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Bessent also\u00a0said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that a TikTok deal announced last month was set to be finalized Thursday during the Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "After his visit to Japan, Mr. Trump is set to end his Asian tour in South Korea, where he's expected to meet with Xi on the sidelines of a Pacific Rim summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.",
      "Trump renews openness to meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be willing to extend his trip to Asia if there was a chance to talk with reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Since South Korea is the president's last stop before returning to the U.S., \"it's pretty easy to do,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.",
      "Mr. Trump's overtures to reconnect with Kim have gone unanswered.",
      "\"If he wants to meet, I'll be in South Korea,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump rules out running for U.S. vice presidency",
      "On other matters, Mr. Trump rejected the possibility of running for vice president as a way to get back to the presidency, saying, \"I'd be allowed to do it,\" but \"I wouldn't do that.\"",
      "\"I think it's too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it's too cute,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think the people wouldn't like that. It's too cute. It's not \u2014 it wouldn't be right.\"",
      "Steve Bannon, a Trump ally, has repeatedly said the president could serve a third term despite a constitutional prohibition. Mr. Trump himself has flirted with the idea.",
      "On Air Force One, Mr. Trump said, \"I haven't really thought about it.\"",
      "He praised Rubio and Vice President JD Vance as potential future Republican candidates. \"I'm not sure if anybody would run against those two. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable,\" he said.",
      "South China Sea, Taiwan, and tariffs",
      "There's no shortage of security issues in the region, including access to the South China Sea and the future of Taiwan. But Mr. Trump's focus has undoubtedly been trade and his desire to realign the international economy in his vision of \"America first.\"",
      "For the most part, that means tariffs, or at least the threat of them. Mr. Trump has frequently used taxes on imports \u2014 from allies and adversaries alike \u2014   in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing or seek more favorable terms.",
      "However, his unilateral power to enact tariffs remains contested. The president is awaiting a Supreme Court decision in a case that could solidify his authority or limit it.",
      "The president flew to Tokyo from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he attended the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He participated in a ceremonial signing of an expanded ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia\u00a0earlier this year.

      "An expedition to try to locate Amelia Earhart's plane on a remote island in the Pacific has been delayed until next year, Purdue University said Monday.",
      "A team of researchers was planning to travel to Nikumaroro Island in early November to determine whether something known as the Taraia Object \u2014 a visual anomaly seen in satellite and other imagery \u2014 is Earhart's aircraft. They are now awaiting additional clearances from local authorities as they work through the permit approvals, and cannot go later this year due to the start of cyclone season, according to a news release.",
      "\"We've overcome other challenges to this project over the past four years, and we will get past this one, too,\" Richard Pettigrew, executive director of the Archaeological Legacy Institute, said in the release. \"Because of the compelling evidence we have in front of us, we have to go to Nikumaroro and get a close look at the Taraia Object. Rest assured that we will do just that, so stay tuned! We will have a revised project schedule worked out soon.\"",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan\u00a0disappeared\u00a0while Earhart \u2014 flying a Lockheed 10-E Electra \u2014 tried to become the first female aviator to circle the world.",
      "Researchers previously said there is \"very strong\" evidence that the object, which is in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is the iconic aviator's plane. Some, however, have expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told NBC News in July.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue and the Archaeological Legacy Institute plan to take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. The item will then be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",
      "Expedition member Steve Schultz, who is Purdue University's senior vice president and general counsel, said \"maritime expeditions require thorough preparation and numerous clearances.\"",
      "\"We have gained valuable insights throughout this process and are very confident and resolved to continue this quest with a planned 2026 departure,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Trump meets Japan's new, first female prime minister, and they sign a bilateral trade deal before going together to greet troops on the USS George Washington.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed a trade agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, as he focuses on cementing deals with key U.S. trading partners during his nearly weeklong trip through Asia.",
      "The deal \u2014 which the two countries agreed to over the summer \u2014 will see\u00a0the U.S. charge\u00a015% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by Mr. Trump. In exchange, Japan has pledged to invest $550 billion in U.S. industry and open its market to American rice, cars and defense equipment. It's not yet clear exactly where those invested dollars would go.",
      "Mr. Trump and Takaichi, who became Japan's first ever female prime minister just last week, also signed a framework that calls for the U.S. and Japan to cooperate on supplying critical minerals and rare earth metals to each other. Mr. Trump has sought mineral deals with countries including Australia\u00a0and\u00a0Ukraine in recent months, as China imposes new restrictions on its exports of rare earths, which are essential for computer chips, aerospace and other technology, as part of a tit-for-tat trade war with Washington.",
      "During brief remarks to the press before a signing ceremony on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump touted the trade deal as \"very fair.\"",
      "\"We're going to do tremendous trade together, I think more than ever before,\" he said, calling Japan an \"ally at the strongest level.\"",
      "Japan is the United States' fifth-largest trading partner, according to\u00a0federal statistics. Japan bought $79.7 billion worth of American goods last year, and the U.S. imported $148.2 billion worth of Japanese goods.",
      "More than one-third of U.S. imports from Japan last year \u2014 or $52.3 billion \u2014 were cars and car parts, powered by Japan's massive auto industry, according to\u00a0federal data.",
      "The American and Japanese leaders, whose countries share a rivalry with China, also spoke about defense cooperation, with Mr. Trump thanking Japan for its weapons orders from the U.S.",
      "During their meeting, which was held at Tokyo's Akasaka Palace guest house, Takaichi called the bilateral relationship the \"greatest alliance in the world\" and said she would like to work with the U.S. toward a \"shared goal of achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"",
      "It was the first meeting for Mr. Trump with Takaichi, a staunch conservative who took office last week. She was close with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a friend of Mr. Trump's up until his assassination in 2022.",
      "\"He was a great friend of mine and a great friend of yours,\" the U.S. president said as he shook Takaichi's hand on Tuesday. Their meeting came within hours of a court hearing in Tokyo during which Abe's assassin pleaded guilty to murdering the former premier with a homemade gun.",
      "In a moment of levity, Takaichi apologized to reporters for a late start to the meeting, saying she was watching game three of the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, Shohei Ohtani, is a native of Japan and has a large following in his home country. After an exciting, 18-inning contest, Los Angeles pulled ahead for a 6-5 victory.",
      "Trump, Takaichi visit troops on the USS George Washington",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump touched down by helicopter with Takaichi aboard the USS George Washington aircraft carrier at the Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo, and they saluted service members before the prime minister and president delivered remarks to the troops.",
      "Mr. Trump was heard praising Takaichi, predicting that she would \"go down as one of the great prime ministers.\"",
      "The Japanese leader was first to step to a lectern on the massive ship to speak to the gathered troops, of whom the White House said there were around 6,000.",
      "She thanked the U.S. forces in Japan for their dedication to peace in the region, and mentioned that six years ago in the same city, Mr. Trump and her predecessor, the late Abe, together and \"demonstrated resolve that Japan and the United States will join hands to ensure peace and security.\"",
      "She said she had a renewed determination to \"carry forward that result\" and make the Indo-Pacific free and open.",
      "\"Now we are facing an unprecedented security environment,\" said Takaichi. \"Peace cannot be preserved\" by conflict alone, she added. \"It can be protected only when there is an unwavering determination and action.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump took the podium, he heaped praise on the U.S. forces gathered before him, as well as the strength of the U.S. military. As the U.S. federal government shutdown neared the one-month mark, Mr. Trump said all the troops present would receive full pay for their deployment despite having to come back to port to attend his visit.",
      "He brought up immigration and the controversial deployment of U.S. National Guard forces to American cities, saying: \"We need safe cities \u2014 whether people like it or not, it's what we're doing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also mentioned the U.S.\u00a0strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, saying each boat had enough drugs to kill 25,000 people and asserting that the attacks had \"stopped almost completely the drugs coming in by sea, and now we'll stop the drugs coming in by land.\"",
      "Following his appearance on the ship, President Trump was to fly back to Tokyo to attend a business leadership reception on Tuesday evening.",

      "On the South Korean front, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he doesn't expect to finalize a trade deal with the country when the U.S. president visits on Wednesday, but said he thinks they're close. Mr. Trump and the South Korean government announced a framework over the summer that was similar to the Japan deal, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "The multi-stop Asia trip will culminate with a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as they look to put an end to the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.",
      "On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump predicted the U.S. and China would complete a trade agreement before he returns to Washington later in the week. The two sides have had a rocky relationship in recent months. The president threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China \u2014 for a total rate of 140% \u2014 starting Saturday, Nov. 1, lashing out against new export restrictions imposed by Beijing.",

      "Previous research has shown that patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit \"notably low levels\" of NAD+, the researchers noted \u2014 which aligns with the fact that NAD+ declines with age.",
      "\"NAD+ may hold the key to healthier aging and could protect us against diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease,\" said Evandro Fei Fang-Stavem, an associate professor at the University of Oslo, in a press release. \"However, we need further research on how to effectively utilize NAD+ in patient treatment.\"",
      "Benefits of NAD+",
      "Research has shown that boosting NAD+ can improve mitochondrial and stem cell function, improve energy metabolism, enhance focus and mood, and support tissue repair, according to Dr. Amanda Kahn, a board-certified internist and longevity expert in New York City.",
      "\"From a longevity standpoint, NAD+ is one of the most central molecules in maintaining youthful cellular function,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"It activates \u2026 longevity pathways that protect against DNA damage and inflammation.\"",

      "NAD+ also activates sirtuins, a group of longevity-related proteins that regulate DNA repair, cellular stress responses and gene expression, Chen said, although he noted that larger human studies are still needed.",
      "Methods of boosting NAD+",
      "In clinical studies, patients with age-related diseases have taken compounds designed to boost NAD+.",

      "These precursors include nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Most people take these NAD+ precursors in the form of pills, capsules or powders.",
      "\"Clinical experience shows that NAD+ therapy enhances energy, focus and endurance while supporting detoxification.\"",
      "\"Oral NAD precursors can modestly raise NAD+ levels and are convenient for daily maintenance,\" Kahn said. \"In contrast, injections or IV infusions bypass the gut and deliver NAD+ directly into circulation, leading to more rapid and noticeable effects on energy, focus and recovery.\"",

      "Health start-up 'SpotitEarly' is using dogs to help sniff out the four most common types of cancer, helping people detect the disease early.",
      "Like all beagles, Iceman has an incredible sense of smell. \u00a0His nose is so powerful, it's used to sniff out cancer. \u00a0Using the beagles' remarkable sense of smell, health startup 'Spotitearly' has created a test for people to get pre-screened for cancer as a way to increase chances of early detection. \u00a0\"Only 14% of the newly diagnosed cancers in the U.S. are done so through the routine screening. So not a lot of people are actually getting those tests on time,\" says CEO Shlomi Madar.",
      "The test is simple, according to Madar, \"All we ask from the patient is to wear a mask for a few minutes, breathe into it, put it in a capsule and send it back to the lab.\" Once the sample is back at the lab, the beagles get to work looking for the four most common types of cancer - breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung. \u00a0In 'Spotitearly's' initial clinical trials, they report, the dogs detected cancer with 94% accuracy. \"We pride ourselves as being able to detect cancer as early as stage one,\" he says, \"If you detect cancer early enough, you can actually increase survival rate up to 99%.\"",
      "The pups are picked for the job because their sense of smell is 100,000 times more sensitive than ours, allowing them to detect the equivalent of half a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. In the lab, their puppy power is coupled with artificial intelligence to detect cancer in the breath sample. \"We monitor the dogs' behavior and physiological signals. So, we look at things like their heart rate, their acceleration,\" Madar explains, \u00a0\"And all that plethora of information is being fed into a machine learning algorithm. So, it actually gets better with time.\"",
      "Each beagle must be trained as a sniffer dog already to even be considered. \u00a0Then they go through a rigorous training process - specifically aimed at identifying specific types of cancer. \"We use a lot of redundancy. So, every sample is being sniffed not by one dog, but the entire pack, and more than once,\" Madar notes.",
      "Results are provided by a healthcare professional within days, who will recommend next steps with a positive test. \u00a0Madar notes this screening isn't meant to replace going to a doctor. \u00a0And, while it is still in clinical studies in the United States, you can pre-order a test kit, expected to be commercially available next year.\u00a0Madar says 'Spotitearly' can detect even more types of cancer as long as they train new packs to sniff them out. \u00a0He adds that any dogs who don't pass training are donated to special needs families."

      "Kodiak Driver's autonomous truck safety evaluation results",
      "Kodiak's VERA Score of 98 matched the highest rating among all fleets evaluated. Fleets with Nauto's safety technology average a score of 78, while those without the technology average only 63.",
      "The Kodiak Driver achieved perfect scores of 100 in inattentive driving, high-risk driving and traffic violations. Its lowest score, 95, came in aggressive driving. The VERA Score combines over 20 vision-based AI variables into one clear safety rating.",
      "Nauto found that every 10-point increase in VERA Score cuts collision risk by about 21%. A near-perfect score like Kodiak's represents a strong improvement over typical human performance on the road.",
      "The strong results didn't come as a surprise to Kodiak's leadership.

Safety is at the foundation of everything Kodiak builds. Our core value is \u2018safety first and always.\u2019 We believe independent safety evaluations like Nauto's help to validate what we already know: the Kodiak Driver is already among the safest drivers on American highways.

      "Burnette said in a company statement that the system \"is never drowsy, never drunk, and always paying attention.\" That constant awareness allows the Kodiak Driver to operate defensively and predictably, two traits linked to safe driving.",

      "A new study in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the PRIMA brain computer interface (BCI) retinal implant helped people with advanced age-related macular degeneration regain some central vision. The device uses a tiny 2 millimeter by 2 millimeter photovoltaic implant that is only 30 micrometers thick, and thinner than a strand of hair. It sits beneath the retina and works with a special pair of smart glasses. The glasses capture images and send them as near-infrared light to the implant. The implant converts that light into small electrical signals that stimulate the optic nerve. This process mimics how healthy retinal cells normally send visual information to the brain.",
      "The study followed 38 participants, 32 of whom completed one year of follow-up. Twenty-six patients experienced measurable improvement in vision, which equals about 80% of the group. Many participants could read letters, numbers and even full pages of text again. Although the restored vision is black and white and slightly blurry, the results are remarkable for people who once believed they would never see clearly again.",

      "Why this matters for AMD treatment",
      "Age-related macular degeneration, often called AMD, is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in older adults. Until now, available treatments could only slow down vision loss. None of them could restore what had already been lost.",
      "The PRIMA implant works with smart glasses to bring central vision back to life. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "The PRIMA implant takes a different approach. It directly replaces the missing function of the retina by turning light into electrical signals. Patients can still use their natural peripheral vision while the implant restores some central vision. This combination creates a more complete visual experience.",
      "The trial showed that the surgery is generally safe. Most side effects occurred within the first two months and resolved soon after. Importantly, the implant did not reduce the patients' remaining natural peripheral vision. Researchers call this a major step toward restoring sight rather than only slowing its decline.",
      "The PRIMA implant was developed by Science Corporation, a brain-computer interface company founded by Max Hodak, who previously cofounded Neuralink. Science Corporation acquired the PRIMA technology from the French firm Pixium Vision, continuing its development toward clinical use.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "The tiny chip sits under the retina and turns light into visual signals. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or someone you love lives with late-stage AMD, this breakthrough may offer real hope. For the first time, there is a device that can restore some sight instead of only preserving what remains. You may want to talk with your ophthalmologist about upcoming trials or future approval of the PRIMA system in your area. The company behind the technology has already applied for European approval, and a process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is underway.",
      "Regaining even partial central vision can make a big difference. Reading text, recognizing faces or simply moving independently becomes possible again. This progress also shows how fast medical innovation is moving. Patients who were once told that nothing could help may soon have a chance to see again.",
      "It is also a reminder to stay informed. Treatments that were once experimental are becoming available sooner than expected. Discussing new technologies with your doctor helps you understand timing, eligibility and what kind of results you can realistically expect.",

      "The PRIMA retinal implant represents a shift in how scientists and doctors think about blindness caused by AMD. For decades, the focus was on slowing down the disease. Now, researchers are proving that restoration is possible. While this generation of the implant provides limited black and white vision, it gives real, functional sight to people who had none. That alone changes lives. More work remains to improve image clarity, color perception and comfort. Still, this is only the beginning. Future versions of the device and smart glasses may make vision restoration even more effective and accessible.",

    "story": [
      "With one trick, you won't have to worry about forgetting passwords on your iPhone again.",
      "Keeping your computer secure is more important than ever. Cyberattacks target computers, accounts and sensitive data daily. Traditional passwords have long been the cornerstone of security, but they come with real challenges. Many of us reuse passwords across sites, and even strong passwords can be compromised in data breaches.",
      "Passkeys offer a safer and more convenient way to authenticate. However, they're still relatively new, and many of us are still trying to figure out how they work. For example, Peter recently reached out asking, \"How do I get a passkey from a PC desktop that doesn't have a camera or fingerprint device?\"",
      "That's a great question, Peter, and you're not alone in wondering about this. The good news is that passkeys are designed to work on virtually any device, whether or not it has biometric hardware like a fingerprint reader or camera. Let's explore what passkeys are, why they're worth using and how to set them up on both Windows and Mac, regardless of your hardware setup.",

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Passkeys make signing in faster and safer by replacing traditional passwords with encrypted keys. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys use cryptography to prove who you are. When you create a passkey, your device makes two keys, one public and one private. The public key goes to the website, and your private key stays on your device. During login, your device confirms your identity with the private key. The website never sees or stores it.",
      "This process blocks phishing and password theft. It also makes sign-in faster. You don't need to remember or type long passwords anymore.",
      "While passkeys simplify authentication, they don't eliminate the need for a secure password manager. Password managers can safely store and sync your passkeys, just as they do with passwords, allowing you to access your credentials across devices and browsers \u2014 even if those devices don't natively sync passkeys, such as between Windows and Apple systems. Using a password manager alongside passkeys creates a bridge between platforms and provides an additional layer of security and convenience.",
      "Can you use passkeys without biometrics?",
      "Yes, you can. A PC or Mac without a camera or fingerprint reader can still use passkeys. On Windows, you unlock them with your Windows Hello PIN. On Apple devices, you can use Touch ID, Face ID or your passcode. The key is having an updated operating system and browser that support passkeys.",
      "If you manage multiple accounts or devices, a password manager that supports passkeys can act as your central vault. This lets you use passkeys even on systems that don't directly support syncing through iCloud or Google Password Manager. It's an easy way to ensure you always have access to your credentials, no matter what kind of device you use.",
      "Why you still need passwords",
      "Not every website supports passkeys yet. Some services still rely on passwords. Keep strong, unique passwords for those accounts. Passwords also serve as backup if you lose a device or can't use your passkey. Over time, more sites will support password-free logins.",
      "This is where password managers continue to play an important role. They bridge the gap between old and new authentication methods, allowing you to store both traditional passwords and passkeys in one secure place. Until the web is fully passkey-ready, combining the two provides both convenience and resilience, giving you a seamless experience across multiple devices and services.",
      "Passkeys also prevent phishing because your private key never leaves your device during sign-in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Passkey support by platform",
      "Works on\u00a0Windows 10 and 11.Windows 11 version 22H2 (KB5030310+) includes passkey management.Unlock with\u00a0Windows Hello PIN, face, or fingerprint.",

      "Mad Max Mode returns in Tesla's latest FSD update",
      "Tesla recently launched its FSD v14.1.2 update. The update follows last year's major FSD v14 release, which introduced \"Sloth Mode\" for slower, more cautious driving. The latest update moves to the opposite end of the spectrum with Mad Max mode.",
      "According to Tesla's release notes, this profile allows higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than Hurry mode. The update has sparked mixed reactions. Some Tesla fans praise it for making driving feel more natural. Critics argue that it invites risky behavior at a time when regulators like the NHTSA and California DMV are already investigating Tesla's advanced driver-assist systems.",

      "A new Mad Max speed profile is now included in Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving interface. (Tesla)",
      "History of Tesla's Mad Max mode since 2018",
      "The Mad Max setting isn't new. Tesla first introduced it in 2018 for the original Autopilot system. At the time, Elon Musk described it as ideal for handling aggressive city traffic. The name, borrowed from the post-apocalyptic movie series, immediately drew attention for its bold tone.",
      "Now, the feature is back in Tesla's latest FSD version. Within hours of release, drivers reported seeing cars equipped with Mad Max mode rolling stop signs and driving over the speed limit. These early reports highlight how the mode may behave more assertively than before.",
      "Why Tesla brought back its Mad Max mode",
      "Bringing back Mad Max mode may serve several purposes for Tesla. It helps demonstrate the company's continuous development of FSD software while appealing to drivers who prefer faster, more decisive movement in traffic. It also acts as a signal that Tesla is still chasing the goal of Level 4 autonomy, even though its system remains classified as Level 2, requiring constant driver supervision.",
      "Tesla owners can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles.\u00a0 (Chesnot/Getty Images)",
      "For Tesla, this feature shows confidence in its progress. For observers, it raises concerns about timing. With multiple investigations and lawsuits in progress, many expected Tesla to focus on safety rather than on more aggressive driving profiles.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you own a Tesla with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), you can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles. This mode provides a more assertive driving experience that includes quicker acceleration, more lane changes, and less hesitation.",
      "However, remember that Tesla's Full Self-Driving system still requires active driver attention. You must keep your hands on the wheel and remain ready to take control at any moment. While the name suggests thrill and speed, safety and awareness should remain your top priority.",
      "Tesla\u2019s speed-profile menu includes the toggle options of Chill, Standard, Hurry, and Mad Max profiles to customize how aggressively their car responds in traffic.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Mike Blake)",
      "If you share the road with Teslas, it's smart to stay alert. Vehicles using Mad Max mode may accelerate or change lanes more quickly than expected. Giving Teslas a little extra space can help reduce surprises and keep everyone safer on the road.",

      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Tesla's decision to reintroduce Mad Max mode is both strategic and provocative. It revives a feature from its early Autopilot days while reigniting debate over the balance between innovation and responsibility. The mode's return reminds everyone that Tesla continues to test the limits of driver-assist technology and public tolerance for it.",

The best way to stay safe is to create strong digital habits that protect your information and your peace of mind. Here are the top ways to defend yourself against phishing threats and financial fraud.",
      "Adding two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) creates an extra layer of protection. Even if a scammer gets your password through a fake American Express email, they cannot access your account without your verification code. Most banks and credit card companies offer this free feature in their security settings. Enable it today and make your login stronger.",
      "Data removal services help clean up your personal information from data broker websites that collect and sell your details to advertisers, marketers and even scammers. Reducing your digital footprint limits the amount of information that phishing attackers can use to make fake emails look convincing. In the case of fake American Express messages, less personal data online means fewer details criminals can use to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Outdated browsers and antivirus programs leave gaps that scammers can exploit. Regular updates close those gaps and strengthen your defense against phishing links and malicious downloads. Set your software to update automatically so you are always protected when opening emails or clicking links.",
      "Make it a habit to log into your credit card accounts directly from the official website, not from email links. Scan your statements for unfamiliar transactions. Early detection helps you report fraud fast and recover funds before more damage is done.",
      "Phishing emails thrive on urgency. Before clicking, take a deep breath and ask yourself: Does this message feel pressured or suspicious? Instead of clicking \"verify now,\" open a new browser tab and visit the official credit card website to check your account. This one simple pause can stop a scam in its tracks.",
      "Good antivirus software not only blocks viruses but also warns you when a site or email is unsafe. Choose a program that includes phishing detection, real-time web protection and email scanning. These tools can automatically block fraudulent look-alike emails before you even open them.",

      "Identity monitoring services keep watch over the dark web and alert you if your personal information, such as your email address, password, or credit card number, appears in stolen data. If scammers gain access to this information, they often use it to create realistic phishing attempts, like the fake American Express \"account restricted\" email. Early detection through identity monitoring allows you to take action, such as changing passwords, freezing credit, or alerting your bank before real damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Legitimate companies like American Express will never ask for full account numbers, passwords, or security codes by email. Familiarize yourself with how real messages from your bank look and sound. If something feels off, forward the message to the company's official fraud department and delete it immediately.",
      "If a phishing attack installs malware on your computer, it can lock or delete files. Keep secure backups on an external drive or a trusted cloud service. That way, even if scammers target your system, you will not lose access to your information.",
      "If an email feels wrong, it probably is. Your intuition is one of your strongest defenses against scams. Combine it with these habits to stay ahead of cybercriminals and keep your personal and financial information safe.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Phishing scams are becoming more advanced, but your awareness is your best defense. When you know how to spot fake emails and stay calm under pressure, you protect both your money and your peace of mind. So next time you get an \"urgent\" message about your account, ask yourself: Would your bank really contact you this way?",

      "LEAKED META DOCUMENTS SHOW HOW AI CHATBOTS HANDLE CHILD EXPLOITATION",
      "How the fake nude images were created and shared",
      "When she was 14, the plaintiff posted a few photos of herself on social media. A male classmate used an AI tool called ClothOff to remove her clothing in one of those pictures. The altered photo kept her face, making it look real.",
      "The fake image quickly spread through group chats and social media. Now 17, she is suing AI/Robotics Venture Strategy 3 Ltd., the company that operates ClothOff. A Yale Law School professor, several students and a trial attorney filed the case on her behalf.",

      "The legal fight against deepfake abuse",
      "States across the U.S. are responding to the rise of AI-generated sexual content. More than 45 states have passed or proposed laws to make deepfakes without consent a crime. In New Jersey, creating or sharing deceptive AI media can lead to prison time and fines.",

      "Why legal experts say this case could set a national precedent",
      "Experts believe this case could reshape how courts view AI liability. Judges must decide whether AI developers are responsible when people misuse their tools. They also need to consider whether the software itself can be an instrument of harm.",
      "The lawsuit highlights another question: How can victims prove damage when no physical act occurred, but the harm feels real? The outcome may define how future deepfake victims seek justice.",
      "Is ClothOff still available?",
      "Reports indicate that ClothOff may no longer be accessible in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, where it was blocked after public backlash. However, users in other regions, including the U.S., still appear able to reach the company's web platform, which continues to advertise tools that \"remove clothes from photos.\"",
      "On its official website, the company includes a short disclaimer addressing the ethics of its technology. It states, \"Is it ethical to use AI generators to create images?

      "Parents and educators worry about how quickly this technology spreads through schools. Lawmakers are under pressure to modernize privacy laws. Companies that host or enable these tools must now consider stronger safeguards and faster takedown systems.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Phishing scams target every kind of institution, whether it's a hospital, a big tech firm or even a fast-food chain. Educational institutions aren't an exception, especially in 2025, when attackers are actively directing their efforts toward them. Universities across the U.S. are facing a new type of cybercrime where attackers are targeting staff to hijack salary payments. Researchers have discovered that since March 2025, a hacking group known as Storm-2657 has been running \"pirate payroll\" attacks, using phishing tactics to gain access to payroll accounts. Let's talk more about this attack and how you can stay safe.",

      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "How does the university payroll scam work",
      "According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-2657 primarily targets Workday, a widely used human resources platform, though other payroll and HR software could be at risk as well. The attackers begin with highly convincing phishing emails, carefully crafted to appeal to individual staff members. Some messages warn of a sudden campus illness outbreak, creating a sense of urgency, while others claim that a faculty member is under investigation, prompting recipients to check documents immediately. In some cases, emails impersonate the university president or HR department, sharing \"important\" updates about compensation and benefits.",
      "Phishing scams are evolving fast, and now universities have become prime targets for payroll theft. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "These emails contain links designed to capture login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real time using adversary-in-the-middle techniques. Once a staff member enters their information, the attackers can access the account as if they were the legitimate user. After gaining control, the hackers set up inbox rules to delete Workday notifications, so the victims do not see alerts about changes. This stealthy approach allows the attackers to modify payroll profiles, adjust salary payment settings and redirect funds to accounts they control, all without raising immediate suspicion.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers are exploiting universities at scale",
      "The hackers don't stop at a single account. Once they control one mailbox, they use it to spread the attack further. Microsoft reports that from just 11 compromised accounts at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. By using trusted internal accounts, their emails appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam.",
      "To maintain access over time, the attackers sometimes enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices, either through Workday profiles or through Duo MFA. This gives them persistent access, allowing them to approve further malicious actions without needing to phish again. Combined with inbox rules that hide notifications, this strategy lets them operate undetected for longer periods.",
      "Microsoft emphasizes that these attacks don't exploit a flaw in Workday itself. Instead, they rely on social engineering, the absence of strong phishing-resistant MFA and careful manipulation of internal systems. In essence, the threat comes from human behavior and insufficient protection, not software bugs.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from payroll and phishing scams",
      "Protecting yourself from payroll and phishing scams isn't complicated. By taking a few careful steps, you can make it much harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts or personal information.",
      "The more information scammers can find about you, the easier it is to craft convincing phishing messages. Services that remove or monitor personal data online can reduce exposure, making it harder for attackers to trick you with targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Scammers often send emails that look like they come from your HR department or university leadership, warning about payroll, benefits or urgent issues. Don't click links or download attachments unless you are 100% sure they are legitimate. Even small mistakes can give attackers access to your accounts.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If an email mentions salary changes or requires action, call or email the HR office or the person directly, using contact information you already know. Phishing emails are designed to create panic and rush decisions, so taking a moment to verify can stop attackers in their tracks.",
      "Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Scammers often try to use credentials stolen from other breaches. A password manager can help you generate strong passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember dozens of different combinations.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Add an extra layer of security by enabling\u00a02FA on all accounts that support it. This means even if someone steals your password, they still can't log in without a second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone.",
      "Even if you follow all precautions, it's smart to monitor your accounts for any unusual activity. Catching unauthorized transactions quickly can prevent bigger losses and alert you to potential scams before they escalate.",

      "Hackers will reroute payments after gaining access to users' login information. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The Storm-2657 attacks show that cybercriminals are targeting trust, not software. Universities are appealing because payroll systems handle money directly, and staff can be manipulated through well-crafted phishing. The scale and sophistication of these attacks highlight how vulnerable even well-established institutions can be to financially motivated threat actors.",

The breach came to light after a cyberattack compromised sensitive patient data, with reports indicating that ransomware operators may have been behind the incident. What makes this case particularly concerning is the scale of the attack and the type of information stolen, which could easily be misused for financial or identity fraud.",

      "What happened at SimonMed Imaging",
      "In January 2025, SimonMed Imaging was alerted by one of its vendors about a potential security incident. The following day, the company noticed suspicious activity on its own network. The company says in response, it reset passwords, enforced two-factor authentication and tightened endpoint security while cutting off third-party vendor access.",
      "Unfortunately, the attackers had already gained access. Between Jan. 21 and Feb. 5, 2025, cybercriminals exfiltrated sensitive data belonging to around 1.2 million individuals. The Medusa ransomware group later claimed responsibility, alleging they had stolen more than 200 GB of data, including patient IDs, financial records and medical scans.",
      "DISCORD CONFIRMS VENDOR BREACH EXPOSED USER IDS IN RANSOM PLOT",
      "SimonMed Imaging discovered suspicious network activity in January 2025, prompting an immediate security response and system lockdown. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The attackers reportedly demanded 1 million dollars to delete the stolen files, or 10,000 dollars per day to delay publishing. SimonMed was later removed from the Medusa leak site, which could suggest a ransom payment, although the company has not confirmed this. In the aftermath, SimonMed brought in cybersecurity experts to investigate and has offered complimentary credit monitoring services to affected individuals.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers linked to the Medusa ransomware group stole data from 1.2 million patients, including IDs, financial details and medical scans. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What data got exposed in the SimonMed breach",
      "While SimonMed's official filing described the exposed data as names and other data elements, the ransomware group's claims suggest a much broader leak. According to the attackers, the stolen dataset included identity documents, payment details, medical reports, account balances and raw imaging scans (via BleepingComputer).",
      "Such information is extremely valuable on dark web marketplaces. Identity details and medical records are often sold in bulk to fraud operators who use them to commit financial scams, insurance fraud, or obtain prescription drugs. Medical breaches are harder to recover from because you cannot reset or replace a medical history or a government ID scan the same way you can change a password.",
      "We reached out to SimonMed for comment, but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "DELIVERY GIANT'S DATA BREACH EXPOSES 40,000 PERSONAL RECORDS",
      "After the breach, SimonMed hired cybersecurity experts, tightened defenses and offered free credit monitoring to affected individuals.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay protected",
      "Even though the company is offering free credit monitoring, leaked data often circulates long after an incident is closed publicly. That is why it is important to take additional precautions on your end to reduce the long-term impact of this breach and future-proof your personal security.",
      "People-search sites collect personal records and make them publicly accessible. Data removal services handle outreach and removals on your behalf, which reduces your exposed footprint online. With less information easily available, it becomes harder for attackers to assemble a complete identity profile for scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "NEARLY A MILLION PATIENTS HIT BY DAVITA DIALYSIS RANSOMWARE ATTACK",
      "If you have ever interacted with SimonMed or any related platform, change your passwords immediately. Avoid reusing old passwords across different accounts. A password manager helps generate strong credentials and stores them securely so you do not have to remember them manually. This reduces the risk of one breach affecting multiple accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Enabling 2FA adds an important layer of verification to your accounts. Even if someone gets hold of your password, they will not be able to log in without the code delivered to your phone or app. It is one of the simplest and most effective security upgrades you can make.",
      "Modern malware includes remote access tools and silent monitoring modules that can stay hidden before launching an attack. Strong antivirus software can detect unusual behavior, protect against ransomware and alert you in real time if something attempts to access your data without permission. This is no longer just about traditional virus protection but active threat monitoring.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and potentially access your private information is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Regularly review your bank statements, insurance records and medical billing activity. Cybercriminals often test stolen information with small, easily overlooked transactions before moving to larger fraud attempts. Catching and reporting these early can prevent a much bigger loss.",
      "Because breaches involving medical providers often expose sensitive identifiers, an identity protection service can be useful. These services scan dark web listings, alert you when your information appears in leaked databases and assist with recovery if fraud occurs. Some plans include legal support and help with credit restoration.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "After a major breach, attackers often launch phishing campaigns that reference the affected company to appear legitimate. Be skeptical of emails or texts mentioning SimonMed or credit monitoring, especially if they request payment or personal verification. Staying aware of current scams and keeping your software updated adds a strong layer of defense.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The SimonMed Imaging breach is another reminder that cyberattacks on healthcare providers are becoming more frequent and far more invasive. Once data is taken, it can circulate indefinitely across criminal networks. Taking protective steps early, including monitoring your identity and reducing your exposed data online, can help you stay ahead of potential misuse.",

      "Spotify's new managed accounts are built for kids under 13. They offer a music-only experience inside the main Spotify app. Parents can use their Family Plan settings to filter explicit lyrics, block certain artists or songs and hide videos or looping visuals called Canvas.

      "Trevor Tomesh is an assistant professor of computer, information and data science at the University of Wisconsin \u2013River Falls. While he stressed that on his campus, he feels like there is room for dialogue among faculty members who might disagree politically, he recognizes that isn't the case at every institute of higher learning in the United States.",
      "\"I do know, though, that even at somewhere like the University of Wisconsin\u2014River Falls, a lot of professors are not very happy to speak up about their views if their views are contrary to the narrative, essentially,\" Tomesh told Fox News Digital, stressing that his views do not represent those of the university where he teaches or the University of Wisconsin system.",
      "Trevor Tomesh is a professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2014River Falls. He spoke to Fox News Digital about being a conservative on a college campus on Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025.\u00a0 (Fox News Digital)",
      "Days after Kirk's assassination on the campus of Utah Valley University, Tomesh took to Facebook to slam academia for its response to the murder. The post took off, not only on Facebook, but on platforms like X, where screenshots were shared far and wide by conservative influencers.",
      "CHARLIE KIRK DIED FOR FREE SPEECH AND UNIVERSITIES STILL HAVE NOTHING TO SAY",
      "\"The fact that Charlie was killed on a college campus for expressing his opinions and ideas \u2014 the one place in society that's sole purpose is to express opinions and ideas \u2014 should be a watershed moment for all universities,\" he wrote. \"Every single member of every single university community \u2014 faculty, administrators, staff and students \u2014 should be lamenting this as it spells the death of the university.\"",
      "Instead, Tomesh wrote, Kirk's death was met with deafening silence.",
      "\"To date, there has been no statement from my university or the University of Wisconsin system,\" he said. \"Not a single one of my students heard from any of their professors about this. How do I know? I asked them.\"",

      "He also expressed disgust for professors and students who celebrated Kirk's assassination, and contrasted the reaction to Kirk's killing with the reaction to a popular Christian, conservative speaker named Sister Cindy Smock holding an event on campus. The school, he said, offered trauma counselors to students, and \"assembled a task force to determine how to handle people like Cindy and the trauma she inflicts on students.\"",
      "Despite his many efforts to get the University of Wisconsin system to address Kirk's death, it did not.",
      "\"Once I came out as a conservative and I made my views known on Facebook, and that my post went viral on Facebook, I had a lot of faculty and staff from all over the world, but from my university as well, message me and say basically, hey, 'I wish that I had the bravery to speak up like you do,'\" Tomesh told Fox News Digital. \"And so it's kind of an environment, it's a cold environment. It's an isolating environment when you're conservative on especially a very liberal campus, which I'm not on a particularly liberal campus, but when you're on a very liberal campus, it can be very isolating.\"",

      "\"So yeah, I use the word 'coming out' because it is something that when you do say, 'I'm a conservative on a college campus,' there is a certain expectation that you may wind up encountering friction,\" he said. \"Either friction from your colleagues or friction from administration, or even you know, backlash from students.\"",
      "He described an ugly scene on campus after Kirk's assassination, when a chalk memorial to the slain conservative leader was \"defaced with some very disturbing things, including one of the things that were written on the bullet casing that took Charlie's life...\"",

      "The first is that Americans, and especially students on college campuses, need to unlearn the idea that speech itself is violence. Secondly, he said Americans need to separate their political ideas from their identities, pointing out that when a political ideology becomes someone's entire identity, any attack on that ideology becomes an attack on the person.",
      "\"And that's one huge problem, I think, especially with the ideological progressives, is that they have taken an assumed identity, assumed ideas into part of their core identity,\" he said. \"And that is a very big mistake, because then any attack on an idea inevitably is interpreted as an attack on your personal identity and on you as a person.\"",
      "Finally, Tomesh offered a stark warning about the direction of the United States if people cannot learn to tolerate dissenting opinions.",
      "\"And if we can't do those two things, we're done. We're toast,\" he said. \"Western culture is over. And it's\u2014I'm serious about that. It's going to be a civil war if we cannot learn those two things.\"",
      "The school explained its decision not to make a statement on Kirk's death in an email to Fox News Digital on Monday.",
      "\"UW-River Falls is committed to freedom of expression, viewpoint diversity, and respectful dialogue.

      "Not one couple who met during season nine of \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d had a fairy-tale ending, a shocking conclusion that has made some fans question whether the dating show is worth their time.",
      "When the series debuted on Netflix in February 2020, viewers gravitated toward its refreshing premise: Can people fall for each other without seeing each other? The idea especially resonated with people who were starting to feel isolated as the Covid-19 pandemic began to take hold.",
      "From their isolated \u201cpods,\u201d contestants speed date each other, engaging in hourslong raw conversations that sometimes can lead to proposals within days of their \u201cmeeting.\u201d Netflix then has the lovebirds test whether they actually mesh in person. The journey ultimately leads some of the couples to the altar, where they are tasked with saying yes or no to their matches after just weeks of knowing each other.",
      "But the absence of genuine romance this season, coupled with several controversies over the past few years, has fueled disdain for the series from some fans who say the show has become unwatchable.",
      "\u201cI think the series has lost its spark, the reason it was created,\u201d said Kadidjha Traore, who was among the many fans who posted about their disappointment on TikTok. She cited the success of season one fan favorites Lauren Speed-Hamilton and Cameron Hamilton, whom she described as \u201cthe poster child of loving being blind.\u201d",
      "However, as the seasons went on,\u201d Traore said, the show \u201ckind of has deteriorated.\u201d",
      "Dating shows continue to vie for viewership in an oversaturated market for such programming. Ratings for the long-running \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise and its numerous spinoffs have waned amid criticism for being too stale. Even highly popular shows like \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d (both the U.S. and U.K. versions) have faced intense scrutiny from fans over how they have handled cyberbullying of contestants and their mental health.",
      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d hasn\u2019t faced a dip in viewership during its five-year run. Each season, which has taken place in a different U.S. city, has continued to maintain a spot in the most-viewed rankings on Netflix after it drops. The season eight premiere this year generated 1.07 billion viewing minutes in the United States for the week of Feb. 10-16, according to Nielsen. (Viewing numbers for the latest season aren\u2019t yet available.)",
      "However, many viewers online have complained that the show no longer lives up to the premise that captivated them. On the  Reddit page dedicated to the show, fans have analyzed the ninth season\u2019s trajectory across hundreds of comments in more than a dozen threads. TikTok users have also dissected the couples in their videos, some of which have racked up millions of views and thousands of likes.",
      "A representative for Netflix didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Keeping viewers engaged is part of the challenge of reality TV, according to Claire Fallon and Emma Gray, co-hosts of the \u201cLove To See It\u201d podcast, which covers other pop culture topics.",
      "\u201cThe thing about a reality television show is that while producers can intervene and do a lot to shape that narrative, you are still dealing with real people at the end of the day,\u201d Gray said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to get what you can get and have to make do with what was felt.\u201d",
      "Fallon said: \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s very straightforward about making a reality dating show, right? Like, you don\u2019t need to write scripts or, you know, get people in costume, and, like, it\u2019s low-budget and it\u2019s a pretty simple formula.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of fans understandably want a season that has good drama, a couple of villains and then at least one love story that\u2019s sort of uplifting that makes them feel inspired and like they can live through the romantic happiness of the people in that relationship,\u201d Fallon added. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have all of those components really firing on all cylinders, especially when people have such high expectations of a show, people are going to start to feel disappointed with the product.\u201d",
      "But that\u2019s a production feat that\u2019s \u201chard to nail in practice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d has received blowback in past seasons, with viewers taking issue with the show\u2019s having technical challenges, short-lived marriages and secret relationships. The candidates\u2019 political beliefs have also sometimes prompted wider discourse surrounding whether ideological differences can still be a deal-breaker when it comes to love.",
      "This season, which took place in Denver, fans appeared especially frustrated by the casting choices. Several online questioned the motivation and maturity of those selected for this season, as well as whether their backgrounds (and their dating histories) were actually vetted.",
      "As with other reality shows, many contestants from \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d have gone on to become influencers and podcasters following their appearances after having gained notoriety and audience on social media.",
      "\u201cPeople can use the show to launch other projects to launch their careers, and that\u2019s not something you can really get around, because that is kind of the attention economy that we live in,\u201d Gray said.",
      "A storyline that drew a lot of negative reactions involved contestant Patrick Suzuki, who was turned down by his match, Kacie McIntosh. She ended their engagement shortly after they met in person. McIntosh told Suzuki it was because she couldn\u2019t do the show anymore, but to the cameras she said it was because she didn\u2019t think her \u201cattraction to him\u201d would \u201cgrow.\u201d (Suzuki is Asian American, and McIntosh said she\u2019d never dated anyone of his ethnicity before.)",
      "Contestants Nick Lancaster and Annie Lancaster also garnered backlash after their discussion in the pods about what they would do if their future kids were gay. Amato said he feels being part of the LGBTQ community is a \u201cfad\u201d (he has since apologized on his Instagram account), and Lancaster said she wouldn\u2019t be thrilled.",
      "\u201cI watch these reality shows to escape,\u201d Traore said. \u201cI like all those shows just to not think about what\u2019s going on right now. But this season of \u2018Love Is Blind,\u2019 like, really just brought you back into it.\u201d",
      "Rikkii Wise, who has amassed a following of about 200,000 people on TikTok, where she posts \u201ctea\u201d (or gossip) related to reality shows, said she actually enjoyed that there were \u201cmess and drama\u201d rather than romance. But she understands the fan complaints \u2014 of the five featured couples, three broke up before the altar, meaning just two weddings were shown on screen.",
      "\u201cObviously you can\u2019t force people to go to the altar, but I think that maybe they should bring that clause back, because if we had no couples go to the altar, the audience is going to be in an uproar,\u201d said Wise, who goes by storytimewithrikkii on social media.",
      "The season nine reunion airs at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT). Wise, who has posted speculation about what will go down in the episode, said she doesn\u2019t believe love is blind, even after having watched every season.",
      "\u201cPeople have found love on the show,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are still married; people do have babies. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about love being blind. I think it\u2019s about, OK, these people really wanted to get married, they found each other, and they are attracted to each other, you know?\u201d",
      "The creator of \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d maintains that the experiment worked as intended.",
      "\u201cIn Season 9, at least one member of each couple felt their love was not strong enough to overcome the challenges of the real world, and they chose not to get married,\u201d Chris Coelen told Netflix\u2019s publication, \u201cTudum.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how the experiment is supposed to work, so I would say not only is the experiment working, I think it\u2019s working better than ever.\u201d"

      "\"The film endings that have really stuck with me are the ones that provoke me to ask more questions, as opposed to give me answers completely,\" Thompson tells TODAY.com.",
      "Here's what happens in the movie, now streaming on Prime Video.",
      "Warning: Spoilers for the movie 'Hedda' ahead.",
      "What happens in \u2018Hedda\u2019?",
      "After getting married, Hedda and George buy a glamorous estate in the English countryside. The couple hosts an evening dinner party to show off and celebrate their new home.",
      "George is an academic and hopes to be hired as a new professor at the local university. Many of the guests of the party are writers and intellectuals who George hopes to impress in order to get the  position. George's main competitor for the job is Eileen Lovborg (Nina Hoss), a female scholar who studies and writes about sexual pleasure, and is also Hedda's former lover.",
      "Eileen arrives at the party with her new lover, Tabitha, and Hedda becomes obsessed with creating chaos. When she is able to get Eileen alone, Hedda confesses that she is still in love with Eileen. Eileen says that she wants to move on with Tabitha, and explains the importance of her new manuscript, which encompasses her life's work.",
      "Hedda purposefully sabotages Eileen's chances for the professorship by stealing her manuscript and convincing her that it was destroyed after being blown into a nearby lake.",
      "How is this adaptation of \u2018Hedda\u2019 different from the original play?",
      "In the original play, Eileen is a man named Eilert. Eilert is also  George's academic rival, but he writes about the history and future of civilization in the play.",
      "\"Eilert becoming Eileen was really about wanting to have another woman in the story, another foil to Hedda,\" DaCosta tells TODAY.com. \u201cI really wanted to explore another way that a woman could attempt to find agency and to attain power.\"",
      "The change in Eilert's gender, and the ensuing queer relationship, adds a new perspective to the story.",
      "\"For me it added so much depth to the characters and to their struggles. It added higher stakes for the search that they are on to understand how to attain freedom,\" DaCosta says.",
      "The film is also set in 1950s England, whereas the play is set in Norway in the late 19th century.",
      "How does \u2018Hedda\u2019 end?",
      "Hedda hides in the study with Eileen's stolen manuscript, and begins to burn it in the fire. George walks in and asks Hedda to stop, saying that she is ruining Eileen's life work.",
      "When Eileen believes her manuscript is gone forever and Tabitha has left her, Hedda gives Eileen one of her prized guns so that she can end her own life.",
      "Eileen holds the gun to her chin, debating whether or not to end her own life, but ultimately decides to live. However, when she steps into the foyer, she accidentally shoots herself in the stomach.",
      "Hedda attempts to hide the weapon when she encounters Judge Brack, her friend and former love interest. Brack blocks her and forces himself onto her, before Hedda escapes and begins to run outside. Brack catches up to Hedda and pushes her onto the ground, restraining her in a chokehold. Suddenly, they hear voices coming from towards the house.",
      "Brack releases Hedda and runs off into the trees. Hedda gets up and walks towards the lake, where she fills her pockets with several large rocks and other heavy objects. Hedda begins to walk into the lake, her full pockets weighing her down.",
      "When only her head is left above the water, someone yells from inside the house, calling after Hedda to say that Eileen is still alive. Hedda grins, and then the credits begin to roll.",
      "\"(Hedda) is between life and death potentially, and then she hears this name,\" DaCosta says. \"It makes her pause, and that pause is long enough for that smile.\"",
      "Hedda dies in Ibsen's play but the movie's ending is more open-ended.",
      "Will there be a sequel?",
      "DaCosta and Thompson hope so!",
      "\"We have had people pitch us a bunch of sequels\" DaCosta said. \"I won't say what happens next, but I have thoughts.\""

      "Her prediction was right. Hours later, the high school senior would go viral for her fast-acting bravery and earn a name within Eilish\u2019s fandom: The \u201cred bandana girl.\u201d",

      "Saint-Surin realized she\u2019d gone viral at her high school\u2019s pep rally. Her \u201cmind started to crumble\u201d thinking of her followers. But the attention excited her, too. \u201cI\u2019m like yes, FINNEAS sees that I don\u2019t play about your sister,\u201d she says.",
      "Stubhub ended up inviting Saint-Surin to Eilish\u2019s Oct. 10 show, where she says she made eye contact with Eilish from the other side of the barricade. On Night 3, which she also attended, she says Eilish smiled at her. At the concerts, Saint-Surin got recognition of her own from fans who had seen the viral video.",

      "Looking back, Saint-Surin reflects on concert etiquette, especially at at time when behavior like concertgoers throwing things at performers is a trend. She hopes the moment encourages people to \u201cenforce more respect (toward) an artist when they\u2019re performing.\u201d",
      "As for what made her the type of person who would intervene when she sees \"disrespect,\" in her words?",

      "\"I have decided to step away from performance for the foreseeable future and pursue some other creative and personal endeavours that I feel would better suit this next phase of my life,\" she wrote. \"I have enjoyed my career immensely, and I still love writing music as I have always seen it as a hobby I was lucky enough to make into a career.\"",

We are all cute little humans just bouncing around the earth looking for hugs.\""

      "Asked if he can name the best thing he\u2019s ever eaten during a TODAY Food segment, Craig visibly flips through his Rolodex of memories, finally shaking his head.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question because every month or two, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my God,\u2019\u201d he says, his eyes lighting up.",

      "Also in attendance, a slew of super-fans watch TODAY Food segments happen in real life, mingle with the anchors and world-class chefs, and enjoy bites from the demos.",
      "\u201cWe had some Korean fried chicken this morning; she\u2019s here tonight,\u201d Craig says of chef Judy Joo and her recipe. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, this is the most amazing Korean fried chicken I\u2019ve ever had.\u2019\u201d",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "Craig adds that earlier in the week, chef Brian Lewis prepared his Herbed Pork Roast during the 3rd Hour, and he thought the same thing: \u201cOh, my God, this is the best pork I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he remembers.",
      "Sheinelle Jones has a similar reaction to another one of Lewis\u2019 dishes that day: the Roasted Beet and Burrata Salad.",
      "\u201cIt was like a beet salad, but it\u2019s not just any beet salad,\u201d she says, waving her hands in the air, emphatically. \u201cIt had fennel and pistachio. It was, like, amazing.\u201d",
      "Alongside anchors Savannah Guthrie, Jenna Bush Hager and Dylan Dreyer, three chefs make their dishes from the \u201cTODAY Loves Food\u201d cookbook. While sampling those foods, attendees are also being served wine, beer and cocktails like Savannah\u2019s Savanita, provided by Diageo, Rockaway Brewing Company and Brooklyn Winery.",

      "Craig says his favorite thing about food segments is the expertise on display.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just the quality of food,\u201d he says, especially from culinary stars like Siri Daly, Edy Massih and Priyanka Naik, who are all in attendance.\u2029\u201cThe untold part of the TODAY Food story is the TODAY Food team, and they just do a remarkable job.\u201d",
      "He enjoys most things he eats on the show, but every now and again, he tries a dish that\u2019s not his thing \u2014 and his face makes that clear.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t hide it,\u201d Craig admits.",
      "\u201cMy mother has said the same thing. But, listen, I\u2019ll try anything,\u201d he says, adding that not everything is for everyone. \u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten better.\u201d",
      "Sheinelle says she\u2019s taken home food from the show that she really enjoyed, but it\u2019s not always a hit with her kids.",
      "\u201cMy kids don\u2019t like their food to touch, so they\u2019re still in the like, \u2018We like chicken, we like potatoes,\u2019 so sometimes I\u2019ll bring something home, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m not sure.\u201d",
      "But the easiest way to tell if an anchor enjoyed the dish is to take a look at their plate at the end of the segment. If it\u2019s empty, it was a hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m called out on a lot on how much food I\u2019m eating,\u201d Dylan says during the event\u2019s opening remarks. \u201cWhen you\u2019re surrounded by the best-of-the best chefs, you want to taste their food.",
      "\u201cAnd then my mom\u2019s texting me after, \u2018Was that really as good as you made it sound? Should I try that recipe?\u2019 and I say, \u2018Yes, you have to try that recipe.\u2019\u201d"

      "Inside each ampule is the substance at the heart of the geopolitical strife between the United States and China: fentanyl, the deadly opioid set to be top of the agenda when Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet Thursday.",
      "NBC News got exclusive access to the headquarters of Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical, the largest producer of the drug in China, and indeed Asia, at its sprawling complex in the central city of Yichang.",
      "Humanwell says that it only supplies fentanyl for use in hospitals and that it does not export any medication to the United States, Mexico or Canada. In 51 years of operating, \u201cwe have never had a single incident of a drug going missing \u2014 not a single dose has ever been lost,\u201d its president, Du Wentao, said in an interview inside his factory, which is surrounded by high fences wrapped in concertina wire and electric sensors.",
      "Humanwell Healthcare is one of only five companies in China licensed to produce fentanyl for use in hospitals, and it makes around 100 million doses of fentanyl variants each year.",
      "After a strict registration process to get past the main gate, all visitors and staff alike \u2014 including the CEO \u2014 are required to wear blue hospital caps, shoe covers and lab coats to ensure they do not contaminate the workspace.",
      "Most of the production line is automated to limit human contact, with the vials being washed and sterilized and then filled with fentanyl using long rubber tubes.",
      "Two staffers in protective gear supervised the process, with an alarm pinging every 10 minutes to remind them to spray their gloved hands with disinfectant. The vials are then inspected using flashes of light, stamped, boxed up and shipped out via a warehouse.",
      "Trump says fentanyl will be the subject of the \u201cfirst question\u201d he asks when he meets with Xi in South Korea, the last stop of his three-country Asian tour.",
      "American officials say the Chinese government hasn\u2019t done enough to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl, which are then processed into the highly addictive opioid in Mexican labs and smuggled across the border to the United States. Though deaths appear to be declining in the U.S., fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Trump, who cited fentanyl as the reason for imposing the first 20% in tariffs on China since retaking office in January, said Wednesday that he believed China is \u201cgoing to help us with the fentanyl situation\u201d and that tariffs would be lowered accordingly.",
      "China has defended its anti-fentanyl efforts and says unrelenting American demand for the drug is to blame for the crisis.",
      "But a State Department report to Congress last month accused the ruling Chinese Communist Party of continuing to \u201csubsidize and otherwise incentivize China-based companies to export synthetic drug precursors, including through tax rebates, monetary grants and awards, and official site visits.\u201d It accused companies controlled by the Communist Party of being \u201ccomplicit in this illicit trade.\u201d",
      "Under pressure from Trump, China made fentanyl a controlled substance in 2019, banning its use outside of medical prescriptions. That slowed the influx of Chinese fentanyl into the U.S., but the \u201cprolific export of chemical precursors and other illicit narcotics remains,\u201d the State Department report said.",
      "Chinese officials reject that narrative.",
      "\u201cChina expresses sympathy for the American people suffering from the fentanyl crisis,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "But he added that \u201cChina is the country most resolute in drug control, with the most comprehensive policies and the best track record. It is also one of the countries with the largest number of controlled substances and the strictest regulations in the world.\u201d",
      "Du, the president of Humanwell Healthcare, which produces 100 million doses annually of fentanyl-based products, says that the meticulously clean, automated and controlled operation observed by NBC News was no facade.",
      "\u201cThe management of fentanyl drugs in China is among the strictest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is absolutely no possibility that any dose from our company has flowed to the United States. I can state this with full confidence and certainty \u2014 there is no issue whatsoever.\u201d",
      "He derided the \"many statements in the U.S. claiming that the fentanyl crisis originates from China,\" saying that is impossible \"given how strict our controls are.\"",
      "As well as the visit to Humanwell, NBC News gained exclusive access to the National Narcotics Intelligence Center in Beijing, which had been sanctioned by Washington in 2020 but saw those measures lifted three years later during the Biden administration as the two countries agreed to resume cooperation on fentanyl.",
      "There, Chinese security officials said the two sides are again exchanging information on how smugglers alter their tactics.",
      "Fentanyl precursors are \"indeed one of our main concerns because drug synthesis techniques and methods are constantly evolving,\" lab director Hua Zhendong told NBC News.",
      "\"We have not found such processing plants domestically,\" he said, so \"most of the relevant information comes from technical exchanges with U.S. counterparts.\"",
      "Hua said the latest precursor chemicals identified by the U.S. \u201care added to our monitoring list so we can strengthen our attention to these substances.\"",
      "He said that banning all fentanyl products outside medical use in 2019 had \"effectively curbed illegal production and trafficking.\"",
      "U.S. officials say that's not the case. The extent to which Washington and Beijing can find common ground on the issue is likely to influence the result of Trump and Xi's meeting this week, though experts say halting the illicit flow of fentanyl components is easier said than done",
      "\u201cI think there is an assumption here that if the Chinese really wanted to shut off these precursors, they could do it,\u201d said Michael Swaine, a senior research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "The problem, he said, is that there is no \u201cset number\u201d of precursors to fentanyl.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a clear list of specific items that you would be able to easily interdict,\u201d Swaine said. \u201cAnd a lot of them, of course, are very dual-use items.\u201d",
      "So while there might be a \u201csymbolic effort\u201d to deal with the fentanyl issue at the Trump-Xi meeting, he said, \u201cI don't think that this is going to go completely away.\u201d"

    "summary": "Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall in Jamaica and Cuba this week, followed what has become a familiar pattern for major storms as the climate changes.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall in both Jamaica and Cuba in the last two days, followed what has unfortunately become a familiar pattern for major storms in a warming world.",
      "The most catastrophic storms \u2014 those with the most intense winds and soaking rains \u2014 were once rare, but they are becoming more likely because of climate change. And similarities are emerging among these powerful hurricanes\u2019 behavior and timing, too.",
      "Before Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 monster, it churned over especially warm waters \u2014 as did other hurricanes over the past decade. This allowed it to strengthen at blistering pace, becoming the most powerful of this year\u2019s Atlantic season and tying the record for strongest landfall ever in the Atlantic.",
      "Then the storm slowed to a crawl, giving it more time to dump rain on Jamaica, another hallmark of hurricanes on a warming planet. Melissa\u2019s timing, too, was notable: It formed late in the season \u2014 hurricane activity has typically been thought to peak in early September \u2014 as ocean heat lingered into the fall.",
      "Taken together, this behavior makes Melissa a kind of poster child for the new normal of hurricanes, experts said.",
      "\u201cThese storms aren\u2019t the same storms as a couple decades ago,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at the nonprofit research group Climate Central.",
      "It\u2019s a shift with life-or-death consequences \u2014 one that forecasters and officials in storm-prone areas are now watching closely.",
      "Intensifying in a hurry",
      "One of Melissa\u2019s most eye-opening characteristics is how remarkably fast it intensified. In just 18 hours, it exploded from a tropical storm into a Category 4 Sunday, before reaching Category 5 strength early Monday.",
      "Climate change is increasing the risk of this \u201crapid intensification\u201d pattern, which the National Hurricane Center defines as an increase in sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph over 24 hours.",
      "In Melissa\u2019s case, Winkley said, unusually warm sea-surface temperatures in the Caribbean and high levels of moisture in the atmosphere caused an \u201cextreme rapid intensification.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at forecasting and understanding when hurricanes are going to make a big boost in intensity, but with Melissa, it even exceeded the best forecast that we can make for it in terms of wind speed,\u201d he said.",
      "Winkley added that the storm passed over Caribbean waters that were 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual \u2014 conditions that climate change made up to 700 times more likely.",
      "Two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit may not sound like a lot when it comes to a giant hurricane, but small temperature differences can really make a big impact,\u201d Winkley said.",
      "Many other recent storms have undergone rapid intensification. Last year, Hurricane Milton\u2019s wind speed increased by 90 mph in roughly 25 hours, and in 2022 Hurricane Ian went through two rounds of rapid intensification before making landfall in Florida. The list goes on: Hurricanes Idalia in 2023, Ida in 2021 and Harvey in 2017 all underwent rapid intensification, too.",
      "Fewer hurricanes, higher impact",
      "In the past 35 years, the number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones that form annually has been decreasing.",
      "\u201cWe find that the number of hurricanes globally, including typhoons, has gone down significantly since 1990,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist who studies hurricanes at Colorado State University.",
      "But that overall decrease is largely due to a drop in cyclone activity in the Pacific, Klotzbach said; Atlantic hurricane activity has risen, primarily as a result of a decades-long trend toward La Ni\u00f1a, a seasonal circulation pattern that tends to weaken the high-altitude winds that discourage hurricane formation.",
      "\u201cLa Ni\u00f1a is good for the Atlantic if you like hurricanes,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "When hurricanes do develop, they\u2019re more likely to turn into major storms as the seas warm.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase of those reaching Category 4 and 5,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "Melissa was the third Category 5 hurricane this year \u2014 the first time in two decades that more than two storms of such power have formed in the same season.",
      "Zachary Handlos, an atmospheric scientist at Georgia Tech University, said that although warmer seas in the future will be more conducive to hurricanes, a warmer atmosphere will force changes to the high-altitude winds that can prevent or destroy hurricanes. These winds could strengthen in some locations and weaken in others, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very straightforward answer.\u201d",
      "How these trends will play out remains an active area of research and scientific dispute.",
      "A longer hurricane season",
      "It\u2019s not lost on experts that the strongest hurricane of the season hit just days before Halloween.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty late into the season at this point. Things should be starting to wind down,\u201d said Derrick Herndon, a researcher in the Tropical Cyclone Research Group at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "The Caribbean has always been a hotspot for powerful, late-season hurricanes, but they\u2019re becoming even more likely, Klotzbach said \u2014 he recently submitted research showing the trend for peer review. At the same time, hurricane data in the era of satellite observations (from 1971 to 2022) suggests that hurricane season is beginning earlier in the year, too.",
      "The fall hurricane pattern has been fueled by the long-term trend toward the La Ni\u00f1a pattern, Klotzbach added, which itself is likely the result of a combination of climate change and natural variability.",
      "La Ni\u00f1a weakens high-altitude winds at a time when Caribbean waters are still hot, setting the stage for storms in late October and early November, he said: \u201cIt loads the dice toward these robust hurricanes.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Melissa was exacerbated by warmer-than-usual waters off Jamaica\u2019s southern coast.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a really intense hurricane in the Atlantic, it\u2019s going to probably be in this part of the world,\u201d Herndon said.",
      "In the past, such a storm would typically have churned up cold water from below the surface and stifled its own growth, according to Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist with the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. But this year, ocean heat is elevated both at the surface and as deep as 200 feet below, he said, so Melissa simply churned up more heat and energy.",
      "Storms are stalling",
      "Just before or after landfall, hurricanes are now more likely to stall and dump immense amounts of rain, according to a study published last year. Other research suggests their forward speed has gotten slower overall, though this remains a topic of debate.",
      "Hurricane Melissa followed the pattern, stalling off the coast of Jamaica as it continued to build intensity. On Tuesday morning, the day of its first landfall, the storm was moving at just around 2 mph. Forecasters expected up to 30 inches of rainfall in parts of Jamaica, which is more than a third of its annual average.",
      "Scientists have not reached a consensus about why some storms are moving more slowly, but some have theorized that it\u2019s because climate change has weakened atmospheric circulation patterns.",
      "Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was a dramatic example of the consequences of such stalling: When it parked over Houston, the storm dropped about 5 feet of rain in some locations. The pattern is particularly problematic because a warmer atmosphere can absorb and deliver more rainfall.",
      "\u201cFor every 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming, the atmosphere can hold onto 4% more moisture,\u201d Winkley said. \u201cWarmer oceans not only boost the intensity of hurricanes, but it allows for more evaporation, so it\u2019s putting more of that rain-making moisture into the atmosphere for these hurricanes to absorb and then unleash.\""

      "Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests.",
      "In a study conducted among healthy adults, people who accumulated most of their daily steps in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had significantly lower risks of heart disease and death nearly a decade later than those who got in several shorter walks throughout the day. The study was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",
      "What\u2019s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.",
      "An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the UK Biobank. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.",
      "Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group \u2014 42.9% of participants \u2014 fell into the under-five-minute category.",
      "After about 9\u00bd years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.",
      "People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.",
      "Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations \u201cdoses.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear dose response,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cThe longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.\u201d",
      "The decision to study people\u2019s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to total number of steps or intensity of physical activity, was intentional, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cEveryone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.\u201d",
      "Forget \u2018exercise snacks\u2019 and 10,000 steps a day",
      "The notion that adults should strive for 10,000 steps a day is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, a professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&M University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode \u2014 changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn\u2019t see as strong health gains, he said.",
      "\u201cYou need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that\u2019s where the health benefits come from,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThe one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.\u201d",
      "Despite mixed research on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be \u201csuboptimally active.\u201d All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.",
      "The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.",
      "\u201cYou have big returns from zero to something,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThen you keep getting benefits, but they\u2019re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you\u2019re not accumulating too many more benefits.\u201d",
      "The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of \u201cexercise snacks,\u201d or spurts of physical activity lasting less than five minutes. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz\u2019s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.",
      "\u201cEvery step counts,\u201d according to the American Heart Association, a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.",
      "\u201cGetting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there\u2019s definitely a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, you\u2019re just not optimizing the benefits.\u201d",
      "\u2018Never too late\u2019 to start walking",
      "The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.",
      "Another research constraint is that participants\u2019 walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people\u2019s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study\u2019s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "One of the study\u2019s biggest strengths, she said, is participants\u2019 average age: 62. It\u2019s a time of life when people may assume they\u2019re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.",
      "\u201cYou can start [walking] at any age; it\u2019s not too late,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThe physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.\u201d",
      "Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it\u2019s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven\u2019t done it for so long,\u201d said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. \u201cThere has to be motivation.\u201d",
      "With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.",
      "\u201cWalking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good form of exercise.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Burevestnik is a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable cruise missile announced in 2018 by Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
    "story": [
      "Russia says it has successfully tested an experimental weapon that sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie: a nuclear-powered cruise missile with unlimited range, whose low-flying, terrain-hugging and loitering capabilities could evade American missile defenses and drop atomic bombs anywhere on Earth.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that the Burevestnik \u2014 meaning \u201cstorm petrel\u201d (a type of sea bird) \u2014 was \u201cindeed a unique weapon that no other country possesses.\u201d",
      "The development has drawn concern internationally, with President Donald Trump saying Monday it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to be conducting such tests when Russia should be focusing on peace talks with Ukraine.",
      "But many Western experts have questioned the value of the missile, which is code-named \u201cSkyfall\u201d by NATO. Some say it doesn\u2019t do anything Russia can\u2019t do already \u2014 while others ridicule it as a waste of money. There are also safety concerns that the mini-reactor that powers the missile could spark a radiation catastrophe.",
      "\u201cThe main reason that no one else has tried to build something like this is that it doesn\u2019t really have any use,\u201d Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told NBC News.",
      "The weapon is instead \u201clargely political,\u201d according to Podvig, who is based in Geneva and runs the Russian Nuclear Forces Project. \u201cIt was important for the Kremlin, I think, that this is unique and something no one else has done before.\u201d",
      "Trump pointed out Monday that there are other ways to deliver a nuclear warhead.",
      "\u201cWe have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores,\u201d he told reporters aboard Air Force One. So a missile \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to go 8,000 miles,\u201d he added.",
      "\"We test missiles all the time,\" he said. \"They're not playing games with us, and we're not playing games with them either.\"",
      "The Kremlin said it saw no reason why the test would \u201cstrain relations between Moscow and Washington,\u201d already complicated by the shelved Putin-Trump summit.",
      "The test was announced Sunday by Putin and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia\u2019s chief of the general staff, who appeared together in a video wearing camouflage fatigues.",
      "Gerasimov told the president the missile had flown for 15 hours and covered 8,700 miles during a test last Tuesday \u2014 a record but not the limit of its range, he said.",
      "Gerasimov spoke of its \u201cassured accuracy against highly protected targets at any range\u201d and said it had \u201ca high capability to evade missile-defense and air-defense systems.\u201d",
      "This was the first time the missile had conducted \u201ca many-hour flight,\u201d Gerasimov added. But the Burevestnik is far from new, having been announced by Putin in March 2018.",
      "It uses a reactor \u2014 essentially a \u201cminiature nuclear power plant\u201d \u2014 to heat air to temperatures of almost 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which powers a ramjet engine that could keep it flying for days, according to a 2019 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an American nonprofit group.",
      "The U.S. and Soviet Union both looked into developing the technology during the Cold War but abandoned it because of the concerns highlighted by experts today.",
      "Those fears were realized in 2019. An offshore explosion in the Russian Arctic killed five scientists and spiked radiation in a nearby city. Experts and later the U.S. government said it was likely a failed Burevestnik test.",
      "Norway said Monday that last week's test was carried out from an archipelago in the Barents Sea. \u201cWe can confirm that Russia has conducted a new test launch of the long-range cruise missile Skyfall (Burevestnik) on Novaya Zemlya,\u201d Vice Adm. Nils Andreas Stensoenes, head of Norway\u2019s Intelligence Service, told Reuters in an emailed statement.",
      "The missile is a so-called second strike weapon, designed to be part of Russia\u2019s response to a nuclear attack. But any such assault on Moscow\u2019s military sites would likely target the Burevestnik\u2019s launch pads, too, Podvig and others believe. It would also likely be detected during its long flight, he said.",
      "He and others read this week's announcement as more of a political response to Trump\u2019s plans for a \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense system in the U.S.",
      "Others see Putin's announcement as a response to sanctions this month by the European Union and Trump.",
      "Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did little to disabuse this idea when asked about it during his daily news briefing Monday.",
      "\"Ensuring security is a vital issue for Russia, especially given the militaristic sentiment we are currently hearing primarily from Europeans,\" he said.",
      "\"Despite all our openness to establishing a dialogue with the United States, Russia, first of all, and the president of Russia, is guided by our own national interests,\" Peskov added.",
      "Some observers, such as Fabian Hoffmann, a doctoral research fellow at the Oslo Nuclear Project, part of Norway's University of Oslo, were not too concerned.",
      "\u201cI celebrate every ruble Russia invests in this useless and unnecessary missile,\u201d he posted to X."

      "The conflict in Gaza had raged largely uninterrupted since Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas-led attacks killed 1,200 people in Israel and led to nearly 250 being taken hostage. Since then, Israeli forces have killed nearly 70,000 people in Gaza, according to local health officials, and devastated the enclave, leaving a vast majority of the population with inadequate access to food, shelter and medical care. Famine was declared in parts of Gaza in August.",
      "In the weeks after the ceasefire deal, the Israeli military has struck Hamas \u201cto eliminate the threat\u201d posed by militants and \u201cdismantle tunnel shafts and military structures used for terrorist activity.\u201d",
      "Hamas, meanwhile, has reasserted its control over parts of the enclave that Israel has withdrawn from \u2014 deploying armed police officers, clashing with rival clans, directly firing on and killing Israeli troops and carrying out at least one public execution."

    "story": [
      "GYEONGJU, South Korea \u2014 President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will meet in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday morning, looking to cool an increasingly heated relationship.",
      "The two sides are expected to discuss moves on tariffs, combating fentanyl and access to rare-earth minerals, while leaving bigger targets for later. The meeting is set to begin at 11 a.m. local time (10 p.m. Wednesday ET).",
      "With a Nov. 10 deadline to reach a tariff deal approaching, what began as Trump\u2019s crackdown on the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. has broadened into a longer list of trade and security issues.",
      "The working expectation is that Trump and Xi will agree on a pause in the fight rather than finalizing a sweeping deal, a person familiar with the meeting planning said. Beijing could ease export curbs on strategically crucial rare earths, Washington could hold off on broad tariff hikes, and both sides could reach for gestures, such as expanded purchases of U.S. farm goods by China.",
      "Xi is also weighing steps on fentanyl chemicals, likely focused on choking off money-laundering networks tied to gangs, this person said. A rollout of a larger agreement could be staged around Trump\u2019s planned visit to China next year.",
      "Trump has sounded upbeat about the prospect of reaching agreements. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do well with China,\u201d he said this week. \u201cWe meet, as you know, in South Korea with President Xi \u2026 and they want to make a deal. We want to make a deal.\u201d",
      "He added that he and Xi have agreed to meet again in China and in the United States, \u201cin either Washington or at Mar-a-Lago.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News this week that meeting is likely to come before Xi\u2019s trip to the U.S. for the G20 at Trump\u2019s Doral property in Florida next fall. Trump is likely to visit Xi in Beijing early next year, just ahead of the Lunar New Year, Bessent said.",
      "The president has said he expects to lower tariffs on China that he imposed over its role in the illicit international flow of fentanyl components. And he hopes to finalize a deal on TikTok that would allow the social media app to continue operating in the U.S. despite a law, passed before he took office, which had been poised to ban it.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump was overheard telling leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that he expects the meeting with Xi to last three to four hours. Both Trump and his Chinese counterpart want the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, the person familiar with the meeting planning said.",
      "Dan Caldwell, a former senior adviser to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said Trump deserves credit for pursuing a pragmatic China policy that maintains what he said was strategic ambiguity while taking steps to restore important military capabilities to deter Chinese aggression.",
      "\u201cA lot of folks wanted to assume that he was going to be reflexively hawkish on China,\u201d Caldwell said of Trump. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201d",
      "But Caldwell cautioned against expecting a breakthrough in Busan. \u201cI don\u2019t think the overall push hinges on one meeting,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cIdeally, these go well, but the whole thing does not hinge on just one set of talks.\u201d",
      "In other words, the goal is to make enough progress to get to the next date between the leaders of the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
      "Miles Yu, a former State Department adviser on China, said the U.S. and Beijing are \u201csizing each other out\u201d with trade now a key battleground issue. Washington is pushing for concrete steps on fentanyl, market access and more, he said, while China \u201cstonewalls and foot-drags\u201d and offers only broad \u201cframeworks.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the root cause of the five rounds of futile negotiations so far with China without a breakthrough,\u201d Yu said, adding that the administration is trying to shift China's approach by rallying its neighbors, a strategy that he said \u201cmay or may not work.\u201d",
      "After talks with Chinese counterparts in Malaysia last weekend, Bessent said negotiators had shaped a framework for the two leaders to consider that spanned tariffs, trade, fentanyl, rare earths and \u201csubstantial\u201d purchases of U.S. agricultural products such as soybeans. He credited Trump\u2019s threat of an additional 100% tariff with creating leverage and said he believes that the framework would avoid that outcome and open space for tackling other issues.",
      "Trump\u2019s meeting with Xi in Busan marks the end of a three-country Asia swing, during which he signed agreements with Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea; made new foreign investment announcements; and proclaimed that tariff leverage can drive warring parties to stand down. Reflecting on his approach, Trump said going against the grain can sometimes deliver results.",
      "\u201cOftentimes you\u2019ll go the opposite way of almost everybody, and you\u2019ll be the one that\u2019s right, and the others will be the one that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said, offering a peek into his thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s where you have your greatest successes.\u201d",
      "Still, Trump is continuing a long-standing practice of meeting with allies before Beijing, which former Assistant Secretary of State Dave Stilwell said indicates that the U.S. is not going to trade its alliance commitments for a deal with China.",
      "Some of the most sensitive terrain in the discussions involves critical minerals, said Stilwell, who also underscored the political guardrails around concerns for the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan: \u201cAcknowledge the words, but look at the actions,\u201d he said, citing Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s recent comments that the U.S. isn\u2019t trading away Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty for better deal terms.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s aides are worried that the president could shift the U.S. position on independence for Taiwan, walking away from long-standing U.S. policy, and have advised him against it, NBC News reported this week.",
      "Trump seemed to downplay any discussions, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll even speak about Taiwan.\u201d",
      "Xi \u201cmay want to ask about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s not that much to ask about. Taiwan is Taiwan.\u201d",
      "Analysts in the region, too, see limited room for a sweeping agreement this week. It\u2019s unlikely that Trump and Xi will reach a comprehensive deal that settles the long-term structural differences between the U.S. and China, said Zeng Jinghan, a professor of international relations at the City University of Hong Kong. \u201cBut some sort of consensus and agreements are very possible,\u201d said Zeng, given that both sides want \u201ca little bit of de-escalation.\u201d",
      "The hope, Zeng added, is for \u201cless aggressive\u201d rhetoric, with both Beijing and Washington likely to come back and declare the meeting a success.",
      "After the meeting, Trump plans to board Air Force One and return to the U.S. He has appeared to relish the receptions from foreign leaders on this quick trip across Asia. In Tokyo, he stood alongside Japan\u2019s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, accepting a gift of cherry blossom trees and a putter that belonged to his late friend and former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe, and in Seoul received from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung a large gold crown, a replica from the Silla period.",
      "In one snapshot, Trump and Myung were pictured in a gift shop at the Gyeongju National Museum, where items on display included a red \"USA\" hat, Trump-branded sneakers and a shirt bearing the president\u2019s mugshot.",
      "Trump praised the welcome he received in \u201cvibrant\u201d Malaysia, where Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim compared their experiences with their countries\u2019 legal systems, saying, \u201cI was in prison, but you almost got there.\u201d"

      "The Pohang Iron and Steel Co. \u2014 which eventually became POSCO \u2014 is one of the largest steel companies in the world, producing more than 37 million tons of crude steel in 2024.",

      "Lee \u2014 who\u2019s been mayor for 11 years \u2014 said he would like Trump to come visit Pohang, which is just a 30-minute drive from Gyeongju, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit will be held and where Trump addressed a CEOs luncheon Wednesday.",
      "Earlier this year, Lee flew halfway across the world to Washington to protest Trump\u2019s tariffs outside the White House with other Pohang representatives. They held English-language signs that said, among other things, \u201cPlease stop imposing steel tariffs on your ally Republic of Korea,\u201d referring to South Korea\u2019s formal name.",
      "Lee said in a Facebook post after his protest that Pohang was \u201cstruggling to the point of dying\u201d and that if the steel industry collapsed, so would construction, automobiles, shipbuilding and energy.",
      "He said he felt he was advocating not just for his city, but for the global steel industry and the many indirect jobs it supports.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t do as much as we\u2019d hoped in Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we sent a strong message to the entire world.\u201d",
      "As the tariffs loom large, the South Korean government is bracing for the long-term impacts and has declared Pohang an \u201cIndustrial Crisis Response Area,\u201d which qualifies the city for more subsidies.",
      "\u201cThe whole economic system will be ruined,\u201d Lee said in the interview, adding that while he thinks the U.S. is doing this mainly because of competition with China, the tariffs are hurting longtime allies such as South Korea and Japan.",

      "The aides have privately expressed concern that Trump, who is pushing to reach a sweeping trade deal with China, may choose to ignore their advice, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. They said they worry that Trump could walk away from long-standing U.S. policy on Taiwan or more subtly shift the U.S. position by framing it with new language.",
      "\u201cEveryone is holding their breath,\u201d one of the people with knowledge of the discussions said.",

      "Administration officials have told Trump to expect Xi to seek a public declaration from him that the United States \u201copposes\u201d Taiwan\u2019s independence, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. Xi has for months pushed for a shift in the U.S. position on Taiwan from the current one, which is that the United States does \u201cnot support\u201d its independence, to saying the United States \u201copposes\u201d it.",
      "While many Americans might see that as a different way of saying the same thing, were Trump to say the United States opposes Taiwan\u2019s independence or even that independence is not a good idea at this time, it would send shock waves across Asia and be seen as a huge gift to Xi.",
      "Openly expressing opposition to Taiwan\u2019s independence would be seen as moving the United States from a neutral position on the issue to clearly standing on the side of China. For decades, U.S. administrations have adopted a policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, and presidents have taken the public position of not supporting its independence.",

      "\u201cThere is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. This is a consensus of the international community and a political commitment made by the U.S. to China,\u201d Liu said.",

      "Canada is on track to lose its measles elimination status as an outbreak that began a year ago continues to spread.",
      "The United States could follow in the coming months.",
      "The Canadian outbreak began in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 cases had been reported. Two babies have died.",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998. The U.S. followed two years later, in 2000.",
      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including the declines in vaccination rates observed in both countries.",
      "But the most significant factor is having ongoing measles transmission for a full year.",
      "\u201cTo really say that a country has lost the status, it takes 12 months of continuous transmission with the same genotype and the same strain of the virus,\u201d said Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).",
      "Canada hit that mark this week.",
      "PAHO, which is part of the World Health Organization, is the group charged with determining whether a country in North, South or Central America has eliminated measles. It is set to convene next week in Mexico City to analyze measles data through the end of October.",
      "If a country loses its measles elimination status, \u201ca corrective action plan will be requested to guide efforts to regain elimination,\u201d according to a PAHO spokesman.",
      "It\u2019s highly unlikely that the U.S. will lose its elimination status during the upcoming meeting, Salas said, because the ongoing outbreak began in January.",
      "In the U.S., at least 1,618 measles cases have been logged so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak that threatens the U.S. elimination status began in West Texas in late January. More than 800 people in Texas and New Mexico have been infected, and the outbreak has spread to other states. Three people died, including two young girls.",
      "It will take time to analyze whether ongoing spread in Arizona, Utah and South Carolina is linked to the West Texas outbreak.",
      "The elimination of measles in the U.S. and Canada \u201cwas a huge achievement,\u201d Salas said. \u201cWhen we say that we sustain the elimination as a region, we are also acknowledging each country for their efforts.\u201d",
      "The possibility of elimination status in Canada is \u201ca wake-up call that we need to do better in vaccinating our general public so we don\u2019t have outbreaks like this,\u201d Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Toronto, said in an interview this week with CTV Television Network in Toronto.",
      "The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is extraordinarily effective, according to the CDC. Two doses, usually given around ages 1 and 5, are 97% effective at preventing infection."

      "The breakthrough came a week after robbers broke into the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, threatening guards and drilling into display cases before escaping on scooters with eight of France\u2019s crown jewels worth an estimated $102 million.",

      "\"I will release additional information at the end of this period of police custody,\u201d she said, adding that she did not want to hinder the investigation.",

      "\u201cThe first message is Trump the peacemaker. The second is Trump the moneymaker,\u201d said Victor Cha of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd then, of course, with the meeting with China, I think what everybody\u2019s expecting is that there\u2019s probably not going to be a big trade deal, but there will be an effort to de-escalate or put a pause on the situation.\u201d",
      "Trade is expected to dominate the week. Aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said he would subsidize U.S. farmers if he did not reach a deal with China, and that he planned to discuss the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war with Xi, saying he\u2019d like to see China \u201chelp us out.\u201d",

      "During the meeting with Xi, Trump said he plans to raise the issue of fentanyl, accusing China of failing to curb the flow of precursor chemicals, and a senior administration official said China\u2019s purchases of Russian oil will also be on the table. Trump said he also expects to discuss Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\u201d Trump said Friday, adding that he expects \u201ca good meeting\u201d even as he has intermittently threatened to call it off over trade frictions, including China\u2019s halt to purchases of U.S. soybeans.",

Trump said before leaving Washington on Friday that he \u201cwould like\u201d to meet with Kim, but was unsure whether it would happen on this trip.",

      "Surgeons extracted the magnets and removed parts of the boy's damaged intestines, according to a report by doctors at the hospital, published Friday in the New Zealand Medical Journal.",
      "The boy, who was not identified in the report, had swallowed \u201capproximately 80\u2013100 5x2mm high-power neodymium magnets\u201d a week prior to his hospitalization, the doctors said. He was discharged after spending eight days in the hospital.",
      "New Zealand banned the sale of small, high-powered magnets in 2013, after the government warned that children could suffer serious injuries if they swallowed the magnets, whether out of curiosity or while playing with them as \u201cmock jewellery.\u201d",
      "\u201cThough these magnets tend to be marketed at adults as office toys and many brands carry strict safety warnings, it is clear from the cases here and overseas that they pose too great a risk to children,\u201d Simon Bridges, then New Zealand\u2019s consumer affairs minister, said in a statement at the time, citing previous child hospitalizations in the U.S. and Australia.",
      "However, the authors of the New Zealand Medical Journal report noted that enforcing the long-standing ban remains challenging, as the magnets can still be easily purchased through online marketplaces.",
      "\u201cWhile these laws can be enforced locally, it is more difficult to regulate products supplied by overseas merchants on large-scale online marketplaces,\u201d the authors said.",
      "\u201cThese platforms are easily accessible especially by children, with purchases being inexpensive and not always requiring age verification,\u201d they added.",
      "The report said that the magnets had been purchased via the Chinese online marketplace Temu. In a statement to NBC News, Temu said it has not yet been able to confirm whether the magnets in question were purchased through its platform.",
      "\u201cWe are sorry to learn about the reported incident and wish the boy a full and speedy recovery,\u201d Temu\u2019s spokespersons said.",
      "\u201cWe take product safety very seriously and continuously monitor our platform to ensure sellers are complying with the safety regulations of the markets they are doing business in,\u201d they said.",
      "The marketplace platform said it has reached out to the New Zealand Medical Journal for more details on the case, and its teams are reviewing relevant listings to ensure they meet local safety standards, adding that any noncompliant products will be removed and sellers found violating platform rules or local laws will face firm action."
