      "Taylor Swift's new film, \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d has topped the weekend box office with $33 million in North America",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 This weekend\u2019s box office belonged to two undeniable draws: Taylor Swift and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.",
      "It might have looked like a heavyweight matchup, but Swift\u2019s devoted fanbase once again proved unstoppable with her film \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 with $33 million in North America, according to Sunday estimates from Comscore. The AMC Theatres release -- announced only two weeks ago with minimal promotion -- served as a companion piece to Swift\u2019s 12th studio album, packaging music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and profanity-free lyric visuals into an 89-minute experience.",
      "The film played at all 540 AMC theaters in the U.S. for three days, ending after Sunday. AMC aired the show in Mexico, Canada and across Europe.",
      "\u201cFor Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cTo be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\u201d",
      "It comes nearly two years after her \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d concert film opened to $96 million, with Swift extending her streak of box office dominance.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson saw a more modest showing. His A24 drama \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d co-starring Emily Blunt, opened in third place with a mere $6 million, trailing Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d which earned $11.1 million and has now accumulated $107 million globally.",
      "Despite strong reviews and a 15-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival -- where Johnson drew praise for portraying MMA legend Mark Kerr \u2014 the film marked one of the lowest openings as a lead.",
      "\u201cWhen major movie stars branch out into more indie roles, like Tom Cruise in \u201dMagnolia,\" they're trying to redefine their career,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThey can straddle both universes, so Dwayne Johnson and all the acclaim he\u2019s getting. That prestige factor. That\u2019s the currency. He knows box office. He studies this and he's a business person. But also realize that when you go outside of your comfort zone, it puts him in a certain light. ... Dwayne Johnson is redefining what he can do.\u201d",
      "Beyond the two marquee names, the rest of the weekend lineup offered a wide mix ranging from animated adventures to horror sequels and international releases.",
      "DreamWorks Animation\u2019s family adventure \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie\u201d debuted in fourth place with $5.2 million, expanding the popular Netflix preschool series to the big screen. Warner Bros.\u2019 supernatural thriller \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites\u201d followed in fifth with $4 million, pulling in $458.2 million globally.",
      "In sixth was \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 Infinity Castle,\u201d the latest entry in the hit Japanese anime saga, earning $3.5 million. A re-release of \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d made a splash in seventh with $3.1 million \u2014 a solid return for the 2022 blockbuster ahead of \u201cAvatar: The Fire and Ash\u201d on Dec. 19.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 were \u201cThe Strangers: Chapter 2\u201d with $2.8 million, the IFC dark comedy \u201cGood Boy\u201d with $2.2 million, marking the company's second-best opening weekend ever. \u201cKantara: A Legend \u2013 Chapter 1\u201d with $1.7 million.",
      "Dergarabedian said he's looking forward to October films such as \u201cTron: Ares,\u201d \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d and \u201cRoofman,\" starring Channing Tatum.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge remained undecided Friday on the treatment and placement plan for a man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and ramming his car into the front gate of her home.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, a 48-year-old from Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism. But in May, Judge Maria Cavalluzzi found him not competent to stand trial after evaluations from two experts. At Friday\u2019s hearing in a Los Angeles court dedicated to mental health cases, she heard arguments on Carwyle's treatment and placement.",
      "Aniston\u2019s lawyer, Blair Berk, spoke on her behalf for the first time, detailing two years of Carwyle\u2019s harassment and stalking, including various failed attempts to make physical contact with the actor.",
      "Cavalluzzi said she leaned toward sending Carwyle to a mental health treatment alternative to imprisonment. She requested another hearing, scheduled for later this month, to hear from a mental health professional before making a final decision.",
      "Prosecutors and Aniston\u2019s attorney will have a chance to weigh in, Cavalluzzi said.",
      "The judge acknowledged Aniston's \u201cvery real\" fear, but she said she can't ignore the opinions of mental health professionals who have evaluated Carwyle and deemed him not a danger to society. The alternative treatment option offers community-based housing, treatment and support services as opposed to incarceration.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, \u201conly feet away from where she was,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Carwyle had a stated and \u201cpersistent delusion\u201d to impregnate Aniston with three children, Berk said, and \u201cthere is simply no way to prevent him from carrying out his delusion if he walks out.\u201d",
      "The prosecution expressed concern that if Carwyle were offered the treatment in Los Angeles, nothing would stop him \u201cfrom traveling those few miles to Ms. Aniston,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Berk and William Donovan, the deputy district attorney, argued Carwyle was a present danger to Aniston and those around her. Berk said he attempted to enter her property twice, but was turned away.",
      "Carwyle\u2019s lawyer, Robert Krauss, said his client qualifies for alternative treatment, arguing that he hasn\u2019t been convicted of violent crimes. Granting him alternative treatment, \u201cis not like giving him a break or showing him leniency,\u201d Krauss said. \u201cIts just one thing and one thing only \u2014 and that is absolute, pure faithfulness of the law.\u201d",
      "Krauss also referenced a report from the probation department, which recommended Carwyle be granted probation and 90 days in jail if convicted, much less than the over three years maximum sentence for his two charges. Carwyle has been in jail since May and, if convicted, could be let out with time served.",

      "When Cavalluzzi asked how she can be sure he won\u2019t walk away from the treatment program \u2014 a stated concern from the prosecution \u2014 Carwyle responded, \u201cYou have my word.\u201d",
      "Berk said Carwyle \u201ctraveled thousands of miles over a year ago \u201cafter sending thousands of messages\" that reflected \u201chis delusions and intentions to not just make contact with Ms. Aniston, but to commit criminal wrongs against her, sexual violence against her.\u201d She added that Carwyle stressed in his messaging that he \u201cwould be unabated by doctors or others or FBI intervening.\u201d",
      "Donovan argued that a state hospital is a \u201cmuch safer, much more effective place for him to go,\u201d and will offer the treatment Carwyle needs to address his delusions. The prosecution also argued there\u2019s no evidence that Carwyle\u2019s delusions toward Aniston have stopped, even with medication.",

Krauss said that Carwyle's actions toward Aniston were \u201cjust the product of psychosis from someone who is unmedicated.\" The government must keep its \u201cpromise of treatment rather than punishment and of rehabilitation rather than incarceration,\u201d he said.",
      "The hearing was postponed several times in recent months as Carwyle at first objected to the incompetence finding and asked for an opinion, and both sides sought more time to examine the case.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",

      "Yohji Yamamoto has presented a collection at Paris Fashion Week that distills his signature style to its essence",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Yohji Yamamoto presented a Paris Fashion Week collection Friday that distilled his language to its core: monochrome, urban, fluid silhouettes, touched with flashes of rebellion.",
      "The show opened with pared-down black looks, some bearing graffiti motifs, before soft fringed ensembles in sandals lent the severity a gentler sway.",
      "Tartan arrived in shredded, deconstructed form, interrupting the meditations on black with a jolt of pattern, followed by white gowns that trailed in strips, ethereal yet raw. Foliage-like bands traced torsos like abstract vines. Finally, red emerged in sculptural coats \u2014 a flourish of drama that underlined his instinct for subtle spectacle.",

      "At 81, Yamamoto has long resisted fashion\u2019s cycles. He is still the master of deconstruction: puzzle-piece coats, layered bustles, and Cubist geometries have defined his decades of work. Here, though, he leaned into simplicity, echoing his recent shows where fragility and empowerment are in balance, and where black becomes a multidimensional canvas.",
      "The staging was hushed, the models\u2019 slow stride amplifying the sense of timelessness. In an era of constant reinvention, Yamamoto\u2019s refusal to chase novelty reads as radical. His clothes remain unmistakably his: esoteric, emotional, and enduringly chic.",

And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour.\u201d She and beau Kelce were spotted last year in Lake Como, Italy, but it is unclear if they spent time in nearby Portofino. Additionally, the standard version of her album is available in \u201csweat and vanilla perfume Portofino orange vinyl.\u201d As for the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e? That\u2019s a luxury hotel in Paris.",

      "Taylor Swift's 12th album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" shows she's still at the top of the cultural mainstream",
      "Who is Taylor Swift\u2019s heir apparent? Her 12th album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d offers an answer. It\u2019s Taylor Swift.",
      "Her last album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d ended with the cautionary \u201cClara Bow,\u201d an allegory that seemed to suggest her tenure atop the cultural mainstream was inherited from stars of the past, like the namechecked Stevie Nicks \u2014 and that a new generation of younger, elastic female pop performers could soon take her place. In 2025, there are many to choose from: Consider Chappell Roan\u2019s full-throated theatrics, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s fiery punk-pop feminism, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s cheeky sexuality. In the knotty themes of Friday's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d best illustrated in the title track, Swift asserts that the baton hasn\u2019t been passed, but rather shared. Because she isn\u2019t going anywhere.",
      "\u201cAnd all the headshots on the walls / Of the dance halls are of the b------ / Who wish I\u2019d hurry up and die,\u201d she sings with a wink, \u201cBut I\u2019m immortal now, baby dolls / I couldn\u2019t if I tried.\u201d Notably, if she has a chosen successor in someone else, it\u2019s the album\u2019s sole feature: Carpenter, who sings on the stomp-clap closer in her newly adopted twang. The mournful glissando of lap steel \u2014 the album\u2019s most country moment \u2014 arrives only with Carpenter\u2019s introduction. The western genre is Swift\u2019s past and Carpenter\u2019s future.",
      "If Swift is co-signing Carpenter, she\u2019s also learning from her. Carpenter has cornered the market on tight pop songs with pert, provocative messages; Swift does the same with the manspreading swagger of the George Michael-interpolating \u201cFather Figure,\u201d which mentions a protege, and the funky \u201cWood.\u201d (A carefully veiled PG-13 lyric: \u201cHis love was the key / That opened my thighs,\u201d she sings. \u201cGirls, I don\u2019t need to catch the bouquet / To know a hard rock is on the way.\u201d) Interwoven are suggestive, sensual ad-libs ... and a direct reference to fiance Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast.",
      "Across a brisk 12 tracks \u2014 Swift\u2019s tendency toward abundance doesn\u2019t manifest itself in a double album this time around, but instead in her endless vinyl variants \u2014 \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d mostly delivers on its promise of up-tempo pop \u201cbangers,\u201d to borrow her own vernacular. Fans need not wait up for the long-anticipated \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d because \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d pulls from its essence. But this time, with a lot of affection, like a truer \u201cLover\u201d era.",
      "Swift has long internalized criticisms and responded to them in her art, most directly in 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d Here, she is once again concerned with her perception, articulated over booming, lush production on \u201cCANCELLED!\u201d or \u201cElizabeth Taylor.\u201d On the latter, she sings, \u201cHollywood hates me / You\u2019re only as hot as your last hit, baby.\u201d Except this time, her love acts as an anchor. \u201cI can\u2019t have fun if I can\u2019t have you,\u201d she flirts.",
      "For \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d Swift enlisted Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, the hitmaking duo she collaborated with on 2012\u2019s \u201cRed,\u201d 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and, of course, \u201cReputation.\u201d Notably absent is her frequent producing partner Jack Antonoff. It\u2019s a wise decision: In years past, Swift, Shellback and Martin\u2019s pop experiments shifted not only her career trajectory but the genre itself. Before \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d an EDM drop in the middle of a radio pop hit was unimaginable. After, the style would dominate for half the decade.",
      "\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d isn\u2019t as seismic, but there are addictive and idiosyncratic Swiftisms here: acerbic wit and thick literary references in glassy pop hooks. Where a song like \u201cOpalite,\u201d if attempted by another other performer, would lose its weightlessness under its voluble aspirations, Swift manages to swoon. Stacked, opalescent harmonies and a vintage swing give the song, fittingly, an almost iridescent quality.",
      "And there are bops, like the undeniable opener \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia\u201d with its 1980s-via-Robyn synth-pop and momentary \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d vocal delivery.",
      "There\u2019s a treasure trove of deliciously quotable lines, too, as expected. \u201cPlease God bring me a best friend who I think is hot,\u201d she manages to make effortless in the \u201cMidnights\u201d-esque \u201cWi$h Li$t,\u201d a lovely song about the mundanity of romance and the suburban fantasy of \u201ca couple kids \u2026 a driveway with a basketball hoop.\u201d",
      "Swift\u2019s dense vocabulary is on full display, often full of charm. But it is sometimes unwieldy, a common criticism of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d like when she overstuffs \u201cOur thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions which led to misguided visions\u201d into \u201cFather Figure,\u201d momentarily overvaluing clever writing over clever cadence.",

      "Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is",
      "Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d isn\u2019t what you think it is, especially if you think it\u2019s a movie about a British guy who thinks his typewriter is the tops.",
      "\u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is. It\u2019s the solo directorial debut of the younger Safdie, whose films with his brother, Josh, have rarely not sprinted headlong into unsettling tumult. Add that sensibility to a true-life tale of a mixed martial arts fighter in the late \u201990s, and it\u2019s only natural to spend much of \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bracing for tragedy, for some ear-splitting descent into macho calamity.",
      "Yet \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d starring Dwayne Johnson as MMA pioneer Mark Kerr, is something simpler and less curious. A lack of probing was never anything you could accuse a Safdie brothers\u2019 movie of; these are the filmmakers who plunged a camera into the body cavity of a jewelry-store owner in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d But, despite its grainy, VHS aesthetics, \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is a surprisingly conventional and oddly untroubled movie, albeit one that gives Johnson an indie-film platform for one of his finest performances.",
      "As Mark, Johnson has drained away much of his big-screen charisma. The part \u2014 brawny, often shirtless, frequently raging in the ring \u2014 is immediately so close to Johnson\u2019s own professional wrestling background that early scenes look almost documentary-like. But gone is the megawatt grin and the dashing eyebrow lift. Johnson\u2019s normally polished bald head is here covered with a closely cropped dark head of hair.",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening, Mark rhapsodizes about his feeling of domination. An opponent\u2019s fear, he says, you can \u201csmell in their scent.\u201d At this point, Mark has known only victory in thumping triumphs that leave him feeling like a god. Losing, he confesses, is unfathomable.",
      "The laws of moviedom decree, of course, that Mark will soon lose, and his well-earned sense of invincibility will shatter. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bounces between Mark\u2019s home and Japan, where the Pride Fighting Championship takes place. That\u2019s where Mark, a much-celebrated champion, is taken down by an illegal but nevertheless humbling move. After the fact, the match is ruled a tie, but the stink of defeat never dissipates.",
      "The real battle, in any case, is at home. Mark\u2019s dependence on opioids for the punishing extremes he endures is becoming desperate. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is based on John Hyams\u2019s 2002 documentary of the same name, and part of the nature of that film was the curiosity of Mark\u2019s extreme violence in the ring and his otherwise sweet passivity. In Safdie\u2019s film, Mark is asked in the doctor\u2019s waiting room if fighters hate each other during a bout. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he replies.",
      "But while we don\u2019t doubt Mark\u2019s sincerity \u2014 he\u2019s as earnest as he is muscle-bound \u2014 Johnson also exudes an inner turmoil, and a struggle to keep his rage at bay while nursing mounting wounds to his ego. His body is so stiff, it\u2019s like he could snap at any moment.",

When he tries to give up opioids, he takes her late-night drinking as a provocation. \u201cTreat me like a man,\u201d he tells her.",

But it throws \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d off course, especially when the movie seems to want to lean more on its other central relationship: that of Mark and his friend, trainer and sometimes competitor Mark Coleman (played by former Bellator champion Ryan Bader).",
      "In his films with his brother, Safdie has long brought real-life figures into their movie worlds, blurring fictional boundaries. Bader gives \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d a dose of documentary in his presence, but I\u2019d argue that Johnson\u2019s proximity to this world gives the movie its most compelling real-life echoes.",
      "I happen to think Johnson is also very good in full movie-star mode, especially when he has the chance to wryly undercut his big-screen presence in comedies like \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\u201d or \u201cThe Tooth Fairy.\u201d But it\u2019s also captivating to see him so thoroughly settled into a character like he is in \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d while totally shorn of his charisma.",
      "Yet the potency of that performance is let down by a movie that fails to really grapple with the violent world around Mark, resorting instead for a blander appreciation of these MMA combatants. What does resonate, though, is the portrait of a human colossus who learns to accept defeat \u2014 a mountain of a man who looks like he could, without barely trying, rip someone\u2019s head off at any moment. Instead he takes a deep breath, and doesn\u2019t.",

      "What happened in the days and years next is the subject of PBS\u2019 \u201cMasterpiece\u201d enthralling series \u201cThe Gold,\u201d which traces the ripple effects of Britain's biggest robbery, going from a local search to infiltrating an international money laundering cartel. It starts airing Sunday.",
      "\u201cFrom the minute the show starts, the pressure's on,\u201d says showrunner Neil Forsyth. \u201cThere\u2019s a clock ticking, there\u2019s a net tightening and all these things. So it\u2019s lovely to write characters under that continual pressure.\u201d",
      "The so-called Brinks-Mat heist rocked Britain, leading to changes in banking laws, policing and shining a light on official corruption. Much of the gold was never located. It was melted down and sold back into the financial system, with the proceeds laundered into real estate.",

      "To tell the sprawling story of \u201cThe Gold,\u201d Forsyth streamlined timelines, combined real-life figures and adjusted events to fit the drama. Viewers are told the series was \u201cinspired by real events.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a strict factual drama,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t find that a very attractive route to go down creatively because I like having the space to create and that\u2019s extremely important if you\u2019re going to create something that\u2019s truly entertaining, truly gripping.\u201d",

      "Boyce \u201cwas known to be a safe pair of hands,\u201d says Bonneville, who met the retired officer to prepare for the role. Boyce knew some officers in the department were corrupt and picked a lean, insular team to track down the gold and money.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely was adamant that not on his watch would police corruption thrive,\u201d Bonneville says. \u201cHe\u2019s a real man of integrity and I think that comes through. You\u2019ve got him against all odds trying to steer a level course and get this job done.\u201d",

      "Forsyth was only 5 and living in Scotland at the time of what he calls the \u201ciconic heist.\u201d Despite its impact on British society, no one had pieced it all together in a dramatization or an all-encompassing documentary until now.",

      "It is often said of our greatest actors that they could compellingly recite the phone book.",
      "There's no doubt, just to continue that thought for a moment, that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of our greatest living actors \u2014 perhaps truly the best of them all. And so the first and most important thing to say about \u201cAnemone,\u201d a bleak, somber, absorbing but also sometimes frustratingly opaque collaboration with his director son Ronan, is that it's brought Day-Lewis back. He told us eight years ago that he was done with acting, and we hoped he was exaggerating. At least for now, it seems he was.",
      "As for the phone book: Well, there\u2019s a moment here where you might wish that was indeed the content you were hearing. In one of two remarkable monologues that punctuate a movie otherwise spare with words, Day-Lewis, playing a bitter and lonely recluse, lets loose an anecdote so shockingly scatological and epically disgusting \u2014 the script is co-written by father and son, by the way \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to erase from one\u2019s mind (still trying, here). Somehow, he makes it more fascinating than revolting \u2014 but it\u2019s a Herculean task, something Day-Lewis the actor is obviously no stranger to.",
      "The film's title refers to a flower that we briefly see growing in the lush woodlands where we find Day-Lewis\u2019 character, Ray, eking out the sparest of existences. The father-son writers take their time explaining why exactly Ray has consigned himself to this solitary life, but we get a key hint in the first frames of the film \u2014 violent kids\u2019 drawings, with stick figures carrying long guns, and severed limbs.",

Jem has found it in strict religious practice, and home life with Nessa, Ray's former partner, and Brian, their son.",
      "It is teenager Brian\u2019s deepening troubles that have spurred Jem to seek out his brother in the lush but forbidding woods, where Ray leads an ascetic life devoted to the most basic human survival.

But the brothers connect, slowly, in mundane activities like brushing their teeth, swimming in the ocean, or dancing wildly together.",
      "The words do come tumbling when Ray relates his tale of how he wrought revenge upon a priest who repeatedly molested him as a child. This bracing monologue \u2014 in which he describes defecating on the man in sickening detail \u2014 is only a precursor to an extraordinary speech later in the film that is vintage Day-Lewis, a searing account of the life-altering moment he killed a young boy. \u201cI don\u2019t need your absolution,\u201d he snarls to his brother, when the latter tries to veer him away from the guilt and shame that have crippled him for 20 years.",
      "But clearly Ray does need some sort of absolution, and his confession to his brother is that first step.",

      "Henry Fonda, who died in 1982, joined the 1947 First Amendment committee along with such actors and filmmakers as Humphrey Bogart, John Huston, Lucille Ball and Frank Sinatra. Although highly publicized at the time, the committee had a short and troubled history. Bogart and others would find themselves accused of Communist sympathies and would express surprise when a handful of the Hollywood Ten, including screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, turned to have been Communist Party members at one time or another.",
      "By the following year, Bogart had published an essay in Photoplay magazine entitled \u201cI'm No Communist,\u201d in which he confided that \u201cactors and actresses always go overboard about things\u201d and warned against being \u201cused as dupes by Commie organizations.\u201d Trumbo and others in the Hollywood Ten would be jailed for refusing to cooperate with Congress and found themselves among many to be blacklisted through the end of the 1950s and beyond.",

      "It\u2019s been eight years since Daniel Day-Lewis announced his retirement from acting and said he wanted to \u201cexplore the world in a different way.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- It\u2019s been eight years since Daniel Day-Lewis announced his retirement from acting and said he wanted to \u201cexplore the world in a different way.\u201d",
      "But the big-screen absence of the actor many would peg as the greatest one alive ends with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a new film directed by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis. The two of them wrote it together. What began as something small, with no real ambition, grew until a full feature film and Day-Lewis\u2019 long-awaited return to movies.",
      "\u201cIt saddened me that I had perhaps ruled myself out of that when I decided to work on something else for a while,\u201d Day-Lewis said in an interview alongside his son. \u201cAs we progressed through it, and it seemed less and less possible to contain it, like two fellas in a shed, it began to alarm me slightly. I understood that this was going to involve the full paraphernalia of a film production, and that wasn\u2019t something I was eager to get back into.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we just kept moving forward to see what would happen,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd this is what happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnemone,\u201d which recently premiered at the New York Film Festival and which Focus Features releases Friday in theaters, finds Day-Lewis, now 68, not even slightly less intense or magnetic a performer. It\u2019s a father-son story, though not an autobiographical one. Day-Lewis stars as Ray Stoker, a solitary hermit living in a remote cabin. His brother, Jem (Sean Bean), arrives and tries to convince him to return to his teenage son.",
      "Since 2017\u2019s \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Day-Lewis has, among other things, studied violin making in Boston. But he has also come to think of his declaration of retirement as a mistake, or not quite what he intended. At least, it wasn\u2019t enough to stand in the way of him making a movie with his son.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s been imagined on my behalf by numerous commentators, people that don\u2019t know me, that somehow the way I work has left me so debilitated I can barely open my eyes in the morning. This then requires a period of five or six years recovery!\u201d Day-Lewis says. \u201cThat was never the case. The work itself was always nourishing to me.\u201d",
      "Yet after making \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s London-set portrait of a perfectionist couturier, Day-Lewis was uncertain that he would ever regenerate the appetite to tackle another role.",
      "\u201cI definitely was brought low after I finished shooting \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d more than for any other reason because I anticipated being back in the public arena again,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd this is where I find myself now. And it\u2019s something I never found a solution to from the day I started doing this work until now. The public aspect of my life I\u2019ve always been baffled by.\u201d",
      "The most meaningful gesture Day-Lewis is offering his son might not be making a movie with him, but returning to the spotlight for it. At the New York Film Festival, Day-Lewis has been a happy, humble presence, calling himself a fool for his professed retirement and dutifully accepting a glare of attention that he\u2019s largely avoided for the last decade.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a stark reminder for me of: Oh, yeah, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like,\u201d he said, chuckling.",
      "But Day-Lewis greeted a reporter warmly, urging him to pull a chair \u2014 a Churchill, noted Day-Lewis, a craftsman and furniture maker \u2014 and spoke candidly and thoughtfully about the mystique that has often surrounded his work, an aura he disdains.",

It never changed. I love that work, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t do it as an act of self-flagellation.\u201d",
      "Day-Lewis\u2019 Method-acting immersion in a character has long been the stuff of legend. Jim Sheridan, who directed him in three films, including \u201cMy Left Foot,\u201d once remarked, \u201cDaniel hates acting.\u201d But the idea that Day-Lewis somehow makes himself into a martyr for his art has long chafed with him.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s weighed heavily over the years, this sort of misconception which has now become so ludicrous about Method acting, which is a very bad name in the business now,\u201d says Day-Lewis. \u201cWe all find a different way of approaching the same problems. And when we\u2019re on the set, it makes no goddamn difference what system you train under, Meisner or Method or Stanislavski or whatever it might be. You\u2019re just there trying to live in those moments, to burn yourself up trying to find that truth as well as you can.\u201d",
      "Day-Lewis has sensed some of the same all-consuming imagination in Ronan, a 27-year-old painter making his directorial debut. He\u2019s one of two sons Day-Lewis has with his wife, filmmaker Rebecca Miller. (He also has an older son, Gabriel-Kane Day-Lewis, from his past relationship with Isabelle Adjani.) From a young age, Day-Lewis saw how invested his son was in creating imagery. Ronan, meanwhile, grew up marveling from a distance at his father\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cIt always held a huge amount of mystery to me what he was doing,\u201d says Ronan, who has vivid memories of being on set for films like \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d and \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose.\u201d \u201cTo be inside this realm that I had always been watching curiously from the outside was so intriguing. But there were aspects of his process that still remained a mystery to me, which I think helped, actually.\u201d",
      "For Day-Lewis, building the character of Ray was a step-by-step process that included everything in his woodland world, right down to the expired tin cans of sardines that line his shelves. (\u201cThere were never enough sardines for me,\u201d he says, smiling.) \u201cAnemone\u201d unfolds in fits and starts, with several glorious, improvised monologues surrounded with strikingly lush imagery by Ronan. Day-Lewis so relishes pushing the boundaries of such a fictional world that, once in it, he tends to not want to let go.",
      "\u201cYou hope to create a world, an illusion. And when somebody says to you, \u2018That was the last shot. Go home now,\u2019 that was so bewildering to me because I\u2019m still invested in that world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not I have trouble letting go of it. The trouble I have is that I want to still splash around in that illusion.\u201d",
      "Still, it seems Day-Lewis has in \u201cAnemone\u201d avoided the kind of post-film feeling that followed \u201cPhantom Thread.\u201d The actor hasn\u2019t yet announced a forthcoming project, but he acknowledges feeling the capacity for more. While he doesn\u2019t say he missed acting during the last eight years, he appears to have come to some self-acceptance of its fundamental, irrevocable place in his life.",
      "\u201cIt has been my primary form of self-expression for my entire life, since I was a child,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore, I don\u2019t know if I experience it as a sense of missing if I\u2019m not doing it. But the need to express myself in that way, even at a subterranean level, that is still there.\u201d",
      "But just as it\u2019s time to go, Day-Lewis offers \u201can appendix\u201d to his answer. If \u201cAnemone\u201d has left him still hungry for more, that fact is owed partly to the nature of its making. Not just that it was done with Ronan, but that they made it, themselves. It\u2019s Day-Lewis\u2019 first screenwriting credit.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s a completely new experience for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI never really dared attempt to write before, so it\u2019s a new thing. You can begin with absolutely nothing and the hunger can grow out of that.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Raoul Peck examines the prophetic messages of George Orwell in \u201cOrwell: 2+2=5.\u201d",
      "Filmmaker Raoul Peck uses George Orwell\u2019s writings to weave together a biographical portrait of the author and a dispiriting picture of power and truth in the modern world in \u201cOrwell: 2+2=5.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s hardly the first to connect the dots between Orwell\u2019s prophetic writings and the current state of things \u2014 remember, sales for \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d soared in the months following Donald Trump\u2019s first election when phrases like \u201calternative facts\u201d were being used with no irony. Knowing that, Peck draws heavily on what has come before. The film is packed with clips from film adaptations of \u201c1984,\u201d including Michael Anderson\u2019s black and white version from 1956, and Michael Radford\u2019s, released in 1984, documentaries, like Robert Kane Pappas\u2019s 2003 warning \u201cOrwell Rolls in His Grave,\u201d and news footage from World War II through Gaza. In sum, it makes a persuasive point that things are only getting worse.",
      "\u201cOrwell: 2+2=5\u201d is loosely structured around Orwell\u2019s time on the Isle of Jura, in Scotland, where he wrote what would be his last novel, \u201c1984,\u201d while his health was deteriorating from tuberculosis. He went to Jura in 1946 and was dead by 1950. But this is no Wikipedia page or college lecture. There are no talking heads and no one explaining, \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d",
      "Instead, it\u2019s a loose assembly of biography, reflection and key moments of political awakening, with actor Damian Lewis narrating Orwell\u2019s words with a poetic gravitas, interspersed with a collage of images, words and archival footage. Anything from David Lean\u2019s \u201cOliver Twist\u201d and Sydney Pollack \u201cOut of Africa\u201d to Lauren Greenfield\u2019s \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is on the table, and nothing is there carelessly. Alexei Aigui\u2019s powerful score adds a melancholy weight to sequences showing wartime destruction past and present along with the political phrases used to describe them: A \u201cstrategic bombing\u201d in Berlin in 1945, \u201cpeacekeeping operations\u201d in Mariupol in 2022, \u201cclearance operation\u201d in Myanmar in 2017.",
      "There\u2019s a purposefully disorienting effect to the film\u2019s editing, blending past, present, fiction and reality in such a way that it all begins to blur together. By the time we\u2019re hearing Lewis utter Orwell\u2019s famous phrase \u201cthe very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world\u201d while AI images pollute the screen, it\u2019s easy to forget that the quote is seven decades old. It won\u2019t prepare you for any kind of historical report on Orwell, totalitarianism or doublespeak, but its impact is undeniable.",
      "Orwell understood that every writer is a product of their own time. Born Eric Arthur Blair in Motihari, Bihar, then an outpost of the British Empire, Peck focuses in on a photograph of him as a baby with his Indian nursemaid. Describing himself as \u201clower upper middle class,\u201d Orwell attended Eton and served with the British Imperial Police in Burma (now Myanmar) and observed how power manifested in colonial outposts, how class unattainable in England was suddenly accessible to any white man simply because they were white. He considered himself both a snob and a revolutionary, which only intensified as he picked up more life experiences through the Spanish Civil War, his time at the BBC and simply observing ordinary people around him. It\u2019s actually quite extraordinary just how much information Peck, who has delved into the lives of James Baldwin, Karl Marx, Patrice Lumumba and Ernest Cole, is able to convey in just under two hours.",

      "Police video obtained by The Associated Press shows country music star Morgan Wallen denied throwing a chair off a Nashville bar roof before and after his 2024 arrest",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country music star Morgan Wallen denied to police that he threw a chair off a Nashville honky-tonk bar roof before and after he was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment in 2024, police video obtained by The Associated Press shows.",
      "Roughly two weeks after his April 2024 arrest, Wallen commented on social media: \u201cI'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility\u201d and said he \u201cmade amends\u201d with Nashville law enforcement and others. Then in December, he pleaded guilty to two counts.",
      "The Metro Nashville Police Department released the footage of Wallen\u2019s arrest, captured by several officers' body and cruiser cameras, in response to a public records request from the AP. A previously released arrest affidavit did not get into the details of what Wallen told officers.",
      "A police car camera shows two officers, who were standing outside, react to something apparently falling from above on a late Sunday night. And one officer\u2019s body camera video begins with a shot of a broken chair in the road near his parked police cruiser, close to Chief\u2019s on Broadway, in the city's entertainment district.",
      "Then, as Wallen and his bodyguard team come down to the main entrance on Broadway, one of the men with Wallen is shouting, \u201cHe didn\u2019t see anything. You don\u2019t have witnesses, you are accusing!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw nothing, he didn\u2019t throw nothing,\u201d the bodyguard continues, and accuses two bar workers of \u201cbeing aggressive.\u201d",
      "When an officer asks Wallen what happened, the musician replies, \u201cI don't know.\u201d",
      "He later tells another officer, \u201cWe\u2019ve not tried to cause no problems, man. I don\u2019t know what they are \u2014 I don\u2019t know why.\u201d",
      "That officer said police were figuring out what happened after a chair came flying off the roof and landed by his patrol car. Wallen replied, \u201cAs you should.\u201d",
      "At one point, Wallen is on his cellphone, then points it at the officer and says, \u201cEric Church is on the phone.\u201d Church, another country star, co-owns Chief's. During the call, Wallen had used an expletive to describe the officers he said were \u201ctrying to take me to jail outside of your (expletive) bar.\u201d",
      "Church, who can't be heard on the police recording, recommended to the officer that Wallen wait in a private space instead of standing on the public sidewalk, said a representative for Church.",
      "The officer responds: \u201cIt\u2019s not really something we can do. Law enforcement have to enforce the laws. Figure out what happened. We\u2019ve got a supervisor coming to the scene. Gotta treat it like we would with anybody else.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Wallen did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Back in the bar, police were in an office watching security footage from the roof, body camera footage shows. The security video was not clear from the officers' body cameras and a police spokesperson said there was no security camera footage from the bar in the case files.",
      "The officers return outside and a sergeant, who says he watched security video of Wallen throwing a chair off the roof, handcuffs him.",
      "Another officer talks to two witnesses. One, referring to the chair, says she saw Wallen \u201clift it up and throw it off\u201d and laugh.",

      "Some fans took notice as Wallen stood surrounded by police in Nashville's busy tourist hub. One yells, \u201cWe love you Morgan!\u201d Once Wallen is in the back of the police car, he says to the officer, \u201cGet us out of here,\u201d noting that people were videotaping him.",
      "Born and raised in Sneedville, Tennessee, the two-time Grammy nominee is one of the biggest names in contemporary popular music, loved for his earworm hooks and distinctive combination of bro country, dirt-rock and certain hallmarks of hip-hop. 2023's \u201cOne Thing at a Time\u201d broke Garth Brooks\u2019 record for longest running No. 1 country album, and this year\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m The Problem\u201d spent 12 weeks at No. 1.",
      "Wallen's career has been marked by several other controversies, including a 2020 arrest on public intoxication and disorderly conduct charges after being kicked out of Kid Rock\u2019s bar in downtown Nashville. In 2021, after a video surfaced of him using a racial slur, he was disqualified or limited from several award shows and received no Grammy nominations for his massively popular \u201cDangerous: The Double Album.\u201d",
      "Wallen was talkative in the cruiser, the footage shows, saying, \u201cI ain't done nothing wrong,\u201d and pressing the officer for his favorite country musicians.",
      "\u201cI can tell you my top three right now,\u201d the officer replies. \u201cYou're honestly one of them.\u201d One of Wallen's songs with Thomas Rhett comes on from the officer's playlist.",
      "\u201cThis is me and Thomas Rhett! Turn it up. That\u2019s me and TR! That\u2019s me right there,\u201d Wallen says, before singing a couple of the words from the song.",
      "\u201cTR is one of the best dudes in the world. He would definitely not be getting arrested,\u201d Wallen adds.",
      "Wallen pleaded guilty in December 2024 to two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment. He was sentenced to spend seven days in a DUI education center and be under supervised probation for two years.",
      "When the judge asked how he would plead, he said, \u201cConditionally guilty.\u201d His attorney has said the charges will be eligible for dismissal and expungement after he completes probation.",
      "Wallen's own Nashville honky tonk, not far from Chief\u2019s, opened less than two months after his arrest.",

But many GOP lawmakers are strongly opposed to any extension \u2014 and see the debate as a new opportunity to cut back on the program altogether.",

But while they have been able to chip away at it, they have not been able to substantially alter it as a record 24 million people are now signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments in its latest LGBTQ+ rights case Tuesday, weighing the constitutionality of bans passed by nearly half of U.S. states on the practice known as conversion therapy for children.",
      "The justices are hearing a lawsuit from a Christian counselor challenging a Colorado law that prohibits therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation or gender identity. Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",
      "Colorado, on the other hand, says the measure simply regulates licensed therapists by barring a practice that's been scientifically discredited and linked to serious harm.",
      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",
      "Colorado has not sanctioned anyone under the 2019 law, which exempts religious ministries. State attorneys say it still allows any therapist to have wide-ranging, faith-based conversations with young patients about gender and sexuality.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\u201d Colorado state attorneys wrote.",
      "Therapy isn't just speech, they said \u2014 it's health care that governments have a responsibility to regulate. Violating the law carries potential fines of $5,000 and license suspension or even revocation.",
      "Linda Robertson is a Christian mom of four from Washington state whose son Ryan underwent therapy that promised to change his sexual orientation after he came out to her at age 12. The techniques led him to blame himself when it didn\u2019t work, leaving him ashamed and depressed. He died in 2009, after multiple suicide attempts and a drug overdose at age 20.",
      "\u201cWhat happened in conversion therapy, it devastated Ryan\u2019s bond with me and my husband,\" she said. \u201cAnd it absolutely destroyed his confidence he could ever be loved or accepted by God.\u201d",
      "Chiles contends her approach is different from the kind of conversion therapy once associated with practices like shock therapy decades ago. She said she believes \u201cpeople flourish when they live consistently with God\u2019s design, including their biological sex,\" and she argues evidence of harm from her approach is lacking.",
      "Chiles says Colorado is discriminating because it allows counselors to affirm minors coming out as gay or identifying as transgender but bans counseling like hers for young patients who may want to change their behavior or feelings. \u201cWe're not saying this counseling should be mandatory, but if someone wants the counseling they should be able to get it,\u201d said one of her attorneys, Jonathan Scruggs.",

The group also represented a Christian website designer who doesn\u2019t want to work with same-sex couples and successfully challenged a Colorado anti-discrimination law in 2023.",

Chiles should also be free from that kind of state regulation, the group argued.",
      "Still, the Supreme Court has also found that regulations that only \u201cincidentally\u201d burden speech are permissible, and the state argues that striking down its law against conversion therapy would undercut states' ability to regulate discredited health care of all kids.",
      "The high court agreed to hear the case after the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the law. Another appeals court, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, has struck down similar bans in Florida.",
      "Legal wrangling has continued elsewhere as well. In Wisconsin, the state's highest court recently cleared the way for the state to enforce its ban. Virginia officials, by contrast, have agreed to scale back the enforcement of its law as part of an agreement with a faith-based conservative group that sued.",

      "The problem was discovered when FreshRealm notified the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service that the spinach used in the products tested positive for listeria bacteria.",
      "Last month, FreshRealm said that tests confirmed that pasta used in linguine dishes sold at Walmart contained the same strain of listeria linked to an outbreak in June. That outbreak, originally tied to chicken fettucine Alfredo, has killed at least four people and sickened 20, with the most recent illness reported Sept. 11.",
      "FreshRealm officials said genetic testing found the outbreak strain of listeria in samples of pasta made and supplied by Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California.",

      "The government health agency on Monday announced it has adopted recommendations made last month by advisers picked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Before this year, U.S. health officials \u2014 following recommendations by infectious disease experts \u2014 recommended annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older. The idea was to update protection against the coronavirus as it continues to evolve.",
      "As the COVID-19 pandemic waned, experts increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most at risk for death and hospitalization.",

      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "In a statement Monday, O\u2019Neill celebrated the change, saying past guidance \"deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination.\u201d",
      "\u201cInformed consent is back,\u201d O'Neill said in a statement some doctors objected to.",

      "There is a single shot that contains all four, but it carries a higher risk of fevers and fever-related seizures. Since 2009, the CDC had said it prefers separate shots for initial doses of those vaccines and 85% of toddlers already get the chickenpox vaccine separately.",

      "Experts say a food aid program that helps 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money unless the government shutdown ends within two weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money within two weeks unless the government shutdown ends, forcing states to use their own money to keep it afloat or risk it shutting down, experts say.",
      "The $8 billion Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples that are often out of financial reach for low-income households.",
      "The shutdown, which began Wednesday, coincided with the beginning of a new fiscal year, meaning programs like WIC, which rely on annual infusions from the federal government, are nearly out of money. Currently, the program is being kept afloat by an $150 million contingency fund, but experts say it could run dry quickly.",
      "After that, states could step in to pay for the program and seek reimbursement when a budget finally passes, but not all states say they can afford to do so.",
      "\u201cWe feel good about one to two weeks,\u201d said Ali Hard, policy director for the National WIC Association. \u201cAfter that, we are very worried.\u201d",
      "Taylor Moyer, a mother of three who recently separated from her husband, has been receiving WIC since her first son was born nine years ago. She said the program allowed her to feed her children nutritious food that tends to be pricier than calorie-dense, processed options. It also provided guidance when she struggled to breastfeed and counseled her on how to handle her son's picky eating stage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times where I have sat back in my house and really wondered how I was going to feed my family,\u201d said Moyer, who works at the LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cAnd I went to the store with my WIC card ... I get rice, I got avocados, I got eggs, and I made a balanced meal that was actually good.\u201d",
      "The shutdown came as Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a new spending plan. Democratic lawmakers want to extend tax credits that make health care cheaper for millions of Americans, and they want to reverse deep cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year. They refused to sign on to any spending plan that did not include those provisions.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed Democrats for the shutdown and called them hypocritical because failing to fund the federal government endangers so many health programs.",
      "The WIC program, which has long had bipartisan support, aids those who are pregnant, mothers and children under age 5. Research has tied it to lower infant mortality, healthier birth weights, higher immunization rates and better academic outcomes for children who participate. Nearly half of those who are eligible don't enroll, often because they believe they don't qualify or they can't reach a WIC office.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers want to cut WIC, which is targeted for elimination in Project 2025, the influential policy blueprint authored by the man who's now President Donald Trump\u2019s budget chief. Trump\u2019s budget request and the spending plan backed by House Republicans would not fully fund the program. They also want to cut funding for families to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "In the event of an extended shutdown, several states have sought to reassure WIC recipients that they will continue to receive benefits. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said the state will pick up the tab if federal funding runs out.",

      "SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Friday night was anything but typical at a bar near Paulista Avenue, one of Sao Paulo\u2019s busiest areas and a popular destination for tourists. Nearly every table was ordering beer, wine or draft beer but no cocktails.",
      "Edilson Trindade, the manager who has worked at the bar since 2018, told The Associated Press the establishment usually sells about 80 caipirinhas \u2014 Brazil\u2019s national cocktail made with cacha\u00e7a, lime, sugar and ice \u2014 each night. Last week, he didn\u2019t sell a single one. No other cocktails were ordered, either.",
      "\u201cClients have been worried, and we\u2019re advising them it\u2019s better not to drink cocktails,\u201d Trindade said.",
      "His concern reflects a nationwide unease over distilled beverages following a surge in methanol poisoning cases that has prompted police investigations, stoked public fear and altered drinking habits in recent days.",
      "The Health Ministry said Friday it had confirmed 11 cases tied to alcoholic beverages and was investigating 116 suspected cases. One death was confirmed through lab tests in Sao Paulo, with eleven others under investigation.",
      "Nearly all the cases have been reported in Sao Paulo, the country's most populous state and the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "Last week, local media reported deaths and hospitalizations linked to methanol-tainted alcohol. Some patients were admitted to intensive care with severe symptoms, including blindness.",
      "One of them was the rapper Hungria, who has been hospitalized in Brasilia after possibly drinking altered alcohol. On Friday, he posted on his Instagram account that he was feeling better and would soon be discharged.",
      "\"Friday has a different energy. If you feel thirsty, find a safe place to have a drink,\" the singer said.",
      "Health Minister Alexandre Padilha urged Brazilians to avoid drinking, especially distilled beverages, which are more difficult to verify for adulteration. He described the situation as abnormal and noted that Brazil recorded 20 methanol poisoning cases in August and September, equal to its annual average.",

Another possibility is that the bottles were contaminated with the toxic substance.",

      "Though it\u2019s conventional wisdom, many relationship experts say sticking to such a rule is counterproductive. It may even harm the relationship.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely wrong,\u201d said Samantha Whiten, a clinical psychologist in Maryland. \u201cAll it does is make sure that people are fighting when they\u2019re tired.\u201d",
      "Instead, couples can learn habits that help them get rest while boosting the relationship long term.",
      "It\u2019s understandable to want to discuss a problem before letting it fester, Whiten said, but it\u2019s unrealistic to expect conflicts to be wrapped up quickly and lovingly before drifting off to sleep.",
      "\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a fairy tale, though.\u201d",
      "Some sources attribute the origin of the phrase to the New Testament book of Ephesians. Translations vary, but it\u2019s some version of: \u201cBe angry but do not sin; do not let the sun set on your anger.\u201d",
      "The trouble is, couples shouldn\u2019t fight when they are \u201cemotionally dysregulated,\u201d Whiten said. She referred to the acronym HALT, a common reminder in therapy that people should avoid serious discussions when hungry, angry, lonely or tired. Many people also drink alcohol at night, which doesn\u2019t help create a calm environment.",
      "\u201cThey are more likely to say and do things impulsively that they may regret,\u201d she said.",
      "Discussing problems at night might seem easiest because it's when your partner is most available, said Sabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist in New York City.",
      "But it\u2019s better to acknowledge that something needs to be discussed, take a pause, and set a time to come back to it, she said. That could mean having lunch or coffee together the next day, or any time you\u2019re not rushing out the door.",
      "The key is to follow through.",
      "\u201cIt speaks to a skill, to trust that your partner is really going to return to this thing that\u2019s really important to you,\u201d Romanoff said, adding that most couples have to practice that.",

      "A nonprofit group in Miami is helping reduce the strain on emergency rooms by providing homeless people with health care where they live",
      "MIAMI -- MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Jonas Richards became homeless several years ago after losing his job as a truck driver. Despite suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, seeing a doctor hasn't been a major priority since then.",
      "\u201cWhen you're homeless, it's not easy,\u201d Richards said. \u201cYou find yourself hustling, trying to keep a little money in your pocket, trying to find something to eat.\u201d",
      "But Richards recently had his first visit with doctors from Miami Street Medicine while sitting on a curb outside a homeless shelter.",
      "\u201cYou get everything done right here very fast,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIt was a big help.\u201d",
      "Miami Street Medicine is a nonprofit organization providing free mobile health care services to homeless people. It\u2019s part of a larger group, Dade County Street Response, which also includes a free clinic called Doctors Within Borders, a disaster relief team and a mental health crisis line.",
      "Miami Street Medicine teams of paid staff and medical school student volunteers aren\u2019t just bandaging cuts and handing out aspirin. They\u2019re performing intake on patients with tablet computers and offer follow-up visits for chronic conditions. They're working with specialists like dermatologists, neurologists and cardiologists.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out there to meet the needs of our patients,\u201d founder Dr. Dan Bergholz said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s a cough drop, we\u2019ve got you. We are happy to help you with that cough drop. But really the mission is so much greater. It\u2019s showing that we care, and we\u2019re there for them. So when that cough becomes pneumonia, they\u2019ll let us listen to their lungs and maybe trust us to take them to the hospital.\u201d",
      "Bergholz began laying groundwork for Miami Street Medicine about seven years ago. He said he had started doing charity outreach with homeless people as an undergraduate, but it seemed like more could be done.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like we weren\u2019t quite moving the needle for folks,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "After learning more about the growing trend of street medicine and being accepted to the University of Miami\u2019s medical school, Bergholz began working with other students to set up a program.",
      "\u201cI moved down to Miami early and just started hitting the streets and chatting with people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could call it a needs assessment.\u201d",
      "Just as Miami Street Medicine was taking off, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and forced the group to adjust. Bergholz connected with Dade County Street Response to provide health care to more underserved areas.",

      "One challenge is the transient nature of homeless people, which makes it difficult to provide continual care. Dr. Armen Henderson, founder of Dade County Street Response, said the problem is compounded by laws that target homeless people.",
      "\u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has significantly impacted our patients\u2019 ability to be in one place to get services,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cFor the street medicine team, they know they meet us in one place. But if the majority of those patients are now ending up in jail, now the people are trying to figure out what places are police not harassing them.\u201d",
      "Another challenge is fighting the common sentiment that providing services actually increases homelessness, Henderson said.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that ends homelessness is easy access to housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that encourages people to be unsheltered. No one wants to be unsheltered. So by offering services like this, we\u2019re actually trying to ease people\u2019s suffering. When people come in here, they want to get off the street. They want to figure out a plan.\u201d",
      "Members of Miami Street Medicine have noticed more people losing their homes in recent years as prices increase and wages remain stagnant. Dr. Inaki Bent, who oversees street medicine teams, said he\u2019s also seen an increase in undocumented migrants on the streets as the state and federal governments have expanded immigration enforcement this year.",
      "\u201cI see patients here who are no longer working,\u201d Bent said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer working because the fields and the construction sites have become targets. And they would prefer not to be employed or not to expose themselves to that risk.\u201d",
      "In addition to the individual benefit to patients, providing medical treatment on the street and at the group's clinic prevents treatable conditions from becoming emergencies that ultimately strain the entire health care system. For example, Bent had a patient who had previously been treated for seizures at an emergency room and received a prescription, but couldn't afford it. The patient would have eventually ended up back in the ER, but Miami Street Medicine paid for his medicine.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re able to fill that void and hopefully prevent a couple more admissions,\u201d Bent said. \u201cBut we're also able to do a human service for him, for our fellow man, to provide him with the necessary health care so he can begin his path toward a productive life.\u201d",

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 New Mexico lawmakers moved quickly Thursday at a special legislative session to prop up funding for food assistance and rural health care services in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to federal spending on Medicaid and nutrition programs.",
      "The Democratic-led Legislature sent a flurry of bills to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham that include more than $16 million to sustain food assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and additional funds to bolster food banks, as the federal government ends SNAP eligibility for many noncitizens and changes benefit calculations for others.",
      "\u201cWe need to act to make sure that New Mexicans don't go hungry with SNAP changes at the federal level,\u201d Democratic state Sen. George Mu\u00f1oz of Gallup said.",
      "Another $50 million would help sustain medical services at rural health clinics and hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid spending.",
      "Republicans in the legislative minority voted in unison against the spending provisions, arguing big Medicaid changes are still far away and that New Mexico should focus on reducing errors in benefit distributions.",
      "At the same time, Democrats and some GOP legislators voted to backfill subsidies to health insurance on New Mexico\u2019s Affordable Health Care exchange in case federal credits are allowed to expire. The federal subsidies are a major sticking point of the budget standoff in Washington that prompted the federal government shutdown Wednesday.",
      "In a news release, Lujan Grisham said she'll sign the bills to protect families from being priced out of insurance and ensure health care services are provided in small communities.",
      "Many federal health care changes under Trump's big bill don\u2019t kick in until 2027 or later, and Democratic legislators in New Mexico acknowledged that their bills are only a temporary bandage.",
      "\u201cSome of the most significant (federal) cuts are delayed a few years, and these are deeply significant,\u201d said state Rep. Nathan Small of Las Cruces, lead sponsor of the spending bill. \u201cI want to make sure that we\u2019re all thinking of, not hundreds of millions, but billions of dollars of reduced Medicaid support to our state.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s big bill is prompting urgent action in several Democratic states, but not in Republican ones.",

      "State Sen. Pat Woods, a Republican from the state\u2019s sparsely populated eastern plains, co-sponsored changes to rural health care grants aimed at shoring up existing health care services at rural clinics and hospitals. A 64-3 vote of the House on Thursday sent the bill to the governor for consideration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out a way to fund and keep some of these clinics open. What\u2019s going to happen in the future? Who the hell knows,\u201d Woods told a panel of state lawmakers. \u201cWhat I worry about is keeping these clinics and hospitals open until the dust settles.\u201d",

      "Federal health officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill, prompting outrage from some abortion opponents aligned with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, a regulatory formality that quickly triggered pushback from anti-abortion groups and politicians aligned with the Trump administration.",
      "Drugmaker Evita Solutions announced on its website that the Food and Drug Administration signed off on its low-cost form of the pill, which is approved to end pregnancies through 10 weeks.",
      "Students for Life Action, which opposes abortion, in a statement Thursday called the approval \u201ca stain on the Trump presidency and another sign that the deep state at the FDA must go.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also criticized the move in a post on X, stating, \u201cI have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the agency said the FDA \u201chas very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug,\" and added that FDA officials do not \u201cendorse any product.\u201d",
      "The criticism comes as Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s top health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., face growing pressure from abortion opponents to reevaluate mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.",
      "In a letter to Republican attorneys general last month, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary pledged to conduct a full review of the drug\u2019s safety.",
      "Under Makary and Kennedy, the FDA has repeatedly delayed decisions on vaccines, ultimately narrowing the terms of approval for this year's COVID-19 shots. That type of political intervention was previously highly unusual at the FDA, where career scientists typically make such decisions.",
      "The FDA approved the original version of mifepristone in 2000 and gradually eased access over time. That included approving the first generic pill, from drugmaker GenBioPro, in 2019.",
      "In 2021, the FDA under Democratic President Joe Biden permitted online prescribing and mail-order delivery of the drug, greatly expanding access. Abortion opponents have been fighting the change ever since.",
      "Approval of generic drugs is typically a rote process at the FDA, with multiple copycat versions usually approved after the patent on the original drug expires. In most cases, generic drugmakers only need to show that their drug matches the ingredients and formula used in the original medication.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly how our system is supposed to work, and it has worked this way for decades,\" said Mini Timmaraju of Reproductive Freedom for All. \u201cCareer scientists and civil servants at the FDA did their jobs.\u201d",

      "The FDA typically approves such applications within 10 months. But filing documents posted to the FDA\u2019s website show that Evita Solutions filed its application to market mifepristone four years ago.",
      "On its website, Evita states that it \u201cbelieves that all people should have access to safe, affordable, high-quality, effective, and compassionate abortion care.\u201d",
      "The company said in an email that the drug is expected to launch in January of next year.",
      "Approval of a second generic is unlikely to affect access to the pill, which is typically taken with another drug, misoprostol. The combination accounts for roughly two-thirds of all U.S. abortions. Mifepristone dilates the cervix and blocks the hormone progesterone, while misoprostol causes the uterus to cramp and contract.",
      "Access to mifepristone is restricted across large sections of the country because of state laws that ban abortion \u2014 including medication abortion \u2014 or impose separate restrictions on the drug\u2019s use. Those laws are subject to a number of ongoing lawsuits that are winding their way through the legal system.",

      "The idea of meditating can be intimidating to beginners",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea of meditating can be intimidating. Beginners may imagine sitting uncomfortably in silence while breathing deeply and scrubbing all thoughts from their minds. The prospect of trying those techniques at work may feel embarrassing.",
      "But there are ways to bring short, inconspicuous sessions into the workday if you want to see if meditation can help you deal with challenging customers or reduce anxiety while preparing for a presentation. And experienced practitioners say there's no right or wrong way to do it.",
      "\u201c Meditation is quite easy, as a matter of fact. I think there\u2019s a stigma around it, that you have to be in complete silence, and you have to have some room setup, or do some chanting, or some serious breathing,\u201d said Michelle Beyer, a wellness coach who owns the Brooklyn women\u2019s gym Alana Life & Fitness. \u201cThere\u2019s one-minute meditations you can do to make yourself feel great. Nobody will even know you\u2019re doing them.\"",
      "While there are different meditation techniques, many traditions encourage focusing on breathing to help calm the mind. When thoughts pop up, imagine letting them go. Practitioners say meditating before or at work helps them maintain focus, sit still and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cThere is a calm that I am definitely missing when I have forgotten to do it for a few days,\u201d said Brianna Healy, who meditates for 10 minutes daily before starting her job as assistant director of strategic initiatives and data solutions at Naropa University, a college in Boulder, Colorado, that is inspired by Buddhist principles. \u201cI can always tell the difference in my demeanor.\"",
      "If you feel pressed for time, try fitting meditation sessions into breaks. You can set a timer and focus on breathing while sitting at a desk, in a restroom, inside a vehicle or outside, Beyer said.",
      "Here are some easy mini-meditations to try out on the job.",
      "Commuters can consider getting to work a little early and taking a pause in their cars or a quiet location to decompress from getting out the door and to your destination, said Kathryn Remati, a meditation teacher and author of \u201cBefriend Yourself.\u201d If you only have a minute or two, that's still enough time to try Remati's instructions for a quick reset.",
      "Close your eyes and take a long, slow, deep breath to fill your tummy and lungs with air, she said. Hold the breath for a second, and then slowly breathe out like you're blowing out a candle. \"You\u2019ll immediately feel a shift and you\u2019ll feel like a human again,\u201d Remati said.",
      "While repeating that process, consider setting a positive intention, or goal, for the day. Instead of focusing on a to-do list, think about how you want behave towards others, she said. Some intention examples are, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be productive, but I\u2019m also going to a good listener\u201d or \u201cI want to have a positive attitude,\u201d she said.",
      "Visualization is another technique that experienced meditators use. Picture yourself succeeding at the challenges you\u2019ll encounter that day. If there\u2019s an upcoming deadline, envision yourself finishing the task 10 minutes early. Jumping for joy. Get specific like a movie director and imagine the colors in the room or the feeling of wind on your face, Remati said.",
      "Throughout the day, \u201cyou can bring up that image anytime you need it to refocus,\u201d she said.",
      "You can also use visualization to reframe your perspective on colleagues or clients. A technique Remati recommends putting into practice before meetings may seem quirky: Envision a white light over the meeting room's doorway that showers the people entering with brightness. Remati says it may help you imagine them in a better light. \u201cYou can even put some sort of pink bubble around people,\" she added.",
      "Another short meditation that can be done almost anywhere involves breathing deeply and mentally scanning your body for sensations, a technique popularized in the U.S. by mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn. Depending on your location and comfort level, you can keep your eyes open or closed.",

      "Inhale through the nose and out through the mouth. Start with your feet and work your way up, noticing any areas with pain, tightness, tingling, warmth or other sensations. Think about relaxing the muscles of any spots where there's tension.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re intentionally scanning your body,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about, how do your feet feel in your shoes? How do your ankles feel? Knees, hips, ribs, shoulders, neck, head, and by the time you know it, you checked in with every part of your body.\"",
      "Another discreet meditation technique is breathing deeply and joining your pointer finger to your thumb to form a circle. You can do this if you feel your stress level rising. \u201cSay to yourself, whenever I put my finger and thumb together, I will be able to be peaceful and open-minded,\u201d Remati said.",
      "If you're in a meeting and start to feel resentful or left out, you can do it under the table, and no one will know, she added. Remati does this herself if she notices she's becoming judgmental or short-tempered. \u201cYou just do the finger and thumb, take a nice deep breath, get grounded, and then get back into the meeting and feeling positive,\u201d she said.",
      "One of Beyer's favorite techniques is best done when there aren't a lot of people nearby. Truck drivers can do it in traffic. You inhale, and then when you're breathing out, you hum with your lips closed, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's going to immediately take down stress levels in the body and even in the mind,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cWhen you inhale and you focus on humming, then your brain is focused on that, not the \u2018what ifs' or the worries that like to take over when we feel stressed.\u201d",
      "If you feel self-conscious about humming in a quiet office, you can step outside or head to a noisier place.",
      "The shoulder and jaw release technique also may help relax the bodies of train passengers or drivers or stuck in traffic, Beyer said. To start, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Repeat that, and then on the third exhale, roll your shoulders back. Inhale a fourth time and then on the next exhale relax your tongue and jaw, Beyer said. Finally, inhale again, bring your attention to your hands and just let them hang heavy, she said. Then breathe in and out a sixth time.",
      "Another technique Remati encourages is saying mantras or affirmations, which are positive statements or slogans you repeat to yourself. You can write them down and say them in your head or out loud while breathing deeply, before a meeting or at any point throughout the day.",
      "Some phrases you might say: \u201cI am calm.\" Deep breath. \u201cI am confident.\u201d Deep breath. \"I am ready for success,\u201d Remati suggested. \u201cI speak my truth. I am patient. I am here for the highest good of all.\u201d",

      "That appears to be a common theme for Carroll and other coaches 70 years and older. They thrive on competition, and a leisurely retirement doesn't seem to be as appealing as drawing up game plans and developing athletes.",

      "Just hours after the shutdown began, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that if the Republicans work with them, \u201cthe shutdown could go away very quickly.\u201d",
      "But that won\u2019t be easy. Republican leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump \u2014 have said that they won\u2019t negotiate or be \u201cheld hostage \u201d by Democrats demanding concessions to reopen the government. The bill Democrats voted against was a simple extension of funding for 45 days, legislation they say should be noncontroversial.",
      "While that uncompromising Republican position may not last long \u2014 there were some early, informal talks on the Senate floor Wednesday \u2014 reaching a deal would be difficult. It\u2019s deeply uncertain, for now, if the two sides could find common ground on health care policy or sow enough trust for the Democrats to change their position.",
      "At the same time, an extended shutdown could be increasingly painful for Democrats. The Trump administration has threatened to lay off thousands of workers and target Democratic-leaning states.

      "Republicans, who hold the majority, need eight Democrats to win the 60 votes needed for passage in the 53-47 Senate. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was the only Republican to vote with Democrats against the measure.",

      "Republicans are eyeing several moderate Democrats who appeared to be wavering before casting \u201cno\u201d votes on Tuesday night, including Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Gary Peters of Michigan. Both voted to keep the government open in March, along with Schumer, while many of their colleagues voted for a shutdown.",
      "But Shaheen and Peters each voted no on Tuesday after extensive negotiations with colleagues in both parties on the floor. Shaheen said afterward that \u201cI have been in intensive conversations with colleagues from both sides of the aisle on how to find a path forward and I\u2019m eager to work with my Republican colleagues to find common ground.\u201d",

The American people don\u2019t want us to fund the destruction of their health care and the destruction of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The divisions in the caucus pose a dilemma for Schumer, who was blasted by base voters and activists in March when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open.

      "October is the ideal month to get protected, experts say, because flu cases typically begin climbing in November.",
      "\u201cThe best time is today. If you haven\u2019t already had it, get it. I got mine yesterday,\u201d said Dr. Laura Riley, of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",

      "Tens of thousands of Americans die from the flu every winter. But during last year\u2019s harsh season, the CDC counted 280 children who died of flu-related complications. Nearly half had no prior health problems and about 90% hadn't been fully vaccinated.",
      "Another concern from last season: The CDC counted more than 100 children who developed a rare flu complication \u2014 brain inflammation that can lead to seizures, hallucinations, or even death. Very few were vaccinated.",
      "It\u2019s important for mothers-to-be to understand that a bad case of flu can put them in the hospital or cause their baby to be born prematurely, Riley said.",

      "At issue are tax credits that have made health insurance more affordable for millions of people since the COVID-19 pandemic. The subsidies, which go to low- and middle-income people who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, are slated to expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn't extend them. Their expiration would more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay for premiums next year, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues.",

But the party's lawmakers in Congress argue negotiations over health care will take time, and a stopgap measure to get the government funded is a more urgent priority.",
      "A record 24 million people have signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",
      "With the expanded subsidies in place, some lower-income enrollees can get health care with no premiums, and high earners pay no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners is also expanded.",
      "When the tax credits expire at the end of 2025, enrollees across the income spectrum will see costs spike. Annual out-of-pocket premiums are estimated to increase by 114% \u2014 an average of $1,016 \u2014 next year, according to the KFF analysis.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency was already reeling from massive stuff cuts and dramatic shifts in priority and policy. A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.",

      "Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead \u201cthe worst polluters\u201d to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.",
      "\u201cNobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,\u201d said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.",
      "\u201cThis administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,\u201d Symons said. \u201cWhittling away at EPA\u2019s ability to do its job.\u201d",

      "The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an \u201cenvironmental ethic\u201d in his first speech.",

Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.",
      "The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.",

The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.",

      "Chmut says Russia\u2019s actions in Sumy and Kharkiv \u2014 regions in the northeast where Moscow has maintained a foothold \u2014 are not a serious land grab but an effort to create a bargaining chip for future negotiations, even though efforts led by U.S. President Donald Trump to get Russia and Ukraine to sit at the negotiating table have stalled.",
      "\u201cWhen you cannot agree at the table, you agree on the battlefield,\u201d Chmut said. \u201cRussia will stop where it is stopped by force, not where it chooses.\u201d",

      "Southern right whales are swimming in greater numbers off the coast of Argentina\u2019s Patagonia this year",
      "PEN\u00cdNSULA VALD\u00c9S, Argentina -- PEN\u00cdNSULA VALD\u00c9S, Argentina (AP) \u2014 After coming back from the brink of extinction, Southern right whales are swimming in greater numbers off the coast of Argentina's Patagonia this year, delighting tourists seeking to catch a glimpse of their acrobatics.",
      "Peninsula Vald\u00e9s, located in the Patagonian province of Chubut, is globally important for the conservation of marine mammals and is home to a key breeding population of Southern right whales \u2014 once an endangered species \u2014 as well as elephant seals and sea lions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen whales in Canada and California, but this was the best and probably the largest number of whales I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d said Tino Ventz, a German tourist who recently visited the peninsula with his girlfriend.",
      "The Southern right whale was nearly exterminated by hunting expeditions up until the last century. Before large-scale whaling began, the population in southern waters was estimated at around 100,000, before it was decimated to about 600. Since then, it has slowly recovered to roughly 4,700 whales around Peninsula Vald\u00e9s today.",
      "Whale-watching season in the south American country peaks between August and September. This year, more than 2,000 whales have been spotted, though the actual number is likely higher, scientists say.",
      "Ventz, 24, and his partner joined Argentine Andrea Delfino and her children on a boat trip. Southern winds stirred the whales into more acrobatic breaching, a spectacle that leaves an indelible impression on those who witness it.",
      "Other tourists preferred to watch the whales from the shore, as is common in neighboring Brazil or Uruguay.",
      "Watching from the beach, Agustina Guidol\u00edn, fulfilled her dream of witnessing \u201cthe immensity that borders on the magical and the wild.\u201d The tourists were at El Doradillo Park, a protected natural area in Puerto Madryn, where whales spend time close to shore with their young after giving birth.",
      "In addition to Peninsula Vald\u00e9s and other points in Patagonia, the whales\u2019 migration route extends along Uruguay\u2019s eastern coast and southern Brazil.",
      "Santiago Fern\u00e1ndez, a biologist with Argentina\u2019s National Scientific and Technical Research Council, is part of a project that since 1999 has carried out two to three aerial surveys each year along 640 kilometers (400 miles) of Patagonian coastline. This year\u2019s count recorded 2,100 whales \u2014 863 of them mothers with calves, and the rest solitary individuals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re underestimating the number of whales in the area,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said of the census, noting that it represents only a snapshot, since whales move in and out of the same region as they migrate.",

      "Fern\u00e1ndez added that another project, \u201cFollowing Whales,\u201d conducted by several national and international organizations, tracks individual whales via satellite telemetry within the San Matias Gulf to the north, the San Jorge Gulf to the south, and beyond, to better understand their routes.",
      "From that project, which began in 2014, scientists learned that once the calves grow, the mothers lead them deeper into the gulfs \u2014 whales that are therefore not included in the aerial census.",
      "The growing population is leading to a dispersal \u2014 especially of juveniles and mothers that have already calved \u2014 toward the San Matias and San Jorge gulfs, and even as far north as the coast of Buenos Aires province.",
      "This expansion also brings the whales closer to risks posed by human activity, such as fishing nets and boat propellers, researchers have found, based on injuries suffered by whales unable to return to Antarctica at the end and beginning of their natural cycle.",

    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron faces a political crisis after his prime minister resigned on Monday",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron faces a political crisis after his prime minister resigned on Monday",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron is running out of wiggle room. The abrupt resignation of his prime minister on Monday \u2014 Macron's fourth in more than a year of almost ceaseless political upheaval \u2014 puts the French leader in a bind.",
      "None of the options now for Macron, from his perspective at least, look appetizing. And for France, the road ahead promises more of the political uncertainty that is eroding investor confidence in the European Union's second-largest economy and is frustrating efforts to rein in France's damaging state deficit and debts.",
      "Domestic turmoil also risks diverting Macron's focus from pressing international issues \u2014 wars in Gaza and Ukraine, security threats from Russia, and the muscular use of American power by U.S. President Donald Trump, to name just some of those challenges.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at the latest act in the unprecedented political drama that\u2019s been roiling France since Macron stunned the nation by dissolving the National Assembly in June 2024, triggering fresh legislative elections that then stacked Parliament\u2019s powerful lower house with opponents of the French leader:",
      "When Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu tendered his resignation on Monday morning, he pulled the rug from under the new Cabinet that he'd named less than 14 hours earlier, on Sunday night. The collapse of the blink-and-you-missed-it government \u2014 with ministers out of a job before they'd even had a chance to settle in \u2014 was a bad look for Macron, bordering on farcical for his critics.",
      "It reinforced the impression that Macron \u2014 who famously described himself as \u201cthe master of the clocks,\u201d firmly in control, on his way to winning the French presidency for the first time in 2017 \u2014 is no longer in full command of France's political agenda and that his authority is ebbing away.",
      "One of Macron's loyal supporters, the just-reappointed but now outgoing ecology minister, Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher, captured the mood, posting: \u201cLike many of you, I despair of this circus.\u201d",
      "Perhaps more damaging for Macron were the reasons that Lecornu subsequently gave for his resignation, in an address on the front steps of L\u2019H\u00f4tel de Matignon, the 18th century office of France's prime ministers that, at this rate, may soon need fitting with a revolving door.",
      "The 39-year-old Lecornu explained that the job Macron had given him less than one month ago, after the French leader's previous prime minister was tossed out by a National Assembly vote, had proven to be impossible.",
      "Lecornu said three weeks of negotiations with political parties from across the political spectrum, unions and business leaders had failed to build consensus behind France's top domestic priority: agreeing on a budget for the country for next year.",
      "\u201cBeing prime minister is a difficult task, doubtless even a bit harder at the moment, but one cannot be prime minister when the conditions aren't fulfilled,\u201d Lecornu said.",
      "When the snap legislative elections called by Macron backfired, delivering a hung Parliament since July 2024, the French leader held to the belief that his centrist camp could continue to govern effectively, despite having no stable majority, by building alliances in the National Assembly.",
      "But the voting mathematics in the 577-seat chamber have been a recipe for turmoil, with lawmakers broadly split into three main blocs \u2014 left, center and far-right \u2014 and none with enough seats to form a government alone.",
      "France, unlike Germany, the Netherlands and some other countries in Europe, doesn't have a tradition of political coalitions governing together.",
      "Macron's political opponents in the National Assembly, particularly those on the far-left and far-right, have been in no mood to play ball.",
      "Despite their own bitter ideological differences, they have repeatedly teamed up against the president's prime ministers and their minority governments, toppling them one after another \u2014 and now seemingly convincing Lecornu that he'd be next to fall if he didn't resign first.",

      "The alternative for Macron would be dissolving parliament again, ceding to pressure from the far-right in particular for another unscheduled cycle of legislative elections.",
      "Macron has previously ruled out resigning himself, vowing to see out his second and last presidential term to its end in 2027.",
      "But new elections for the National Assembly would be fraught with risk for the French leader.",
      "The far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen, already the largest single party, could come out on top, an outcome that Macron has long sought to avoid. That could leave Macron having to share power for the remainder of his time in office with a far-right prime minister.",
      "Macron's unpopularity could also deliver a crushing defeat to his centrist camp, giving him even less sway in parliament than he has now and possibly having to make deals and share power with a stronger coalition of left-wing parties.",
      "Or France could get more of the same: political deadlock and turmoil that weakens the French leader at home but that doesn't tie his hands on the world stage.",

      "Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared his readiness to adhere to nuclear arms limits under the 2010 New START arms reduction treaty for one more year, and he urged Washington to follow suit. When asked about the proposal, Trump said Sunday it \u201csounds like a good idea to me.\u201d",

      "He mentioned the longtime U.S. push for including China in any prospective nuclear arms control pact but emphasized that it's up to Washington to try to persuade Beijing to do so.

      "BRANTFORD, Ontario -- BRANTFORD, Ontario (AP) \u2014 Wearing protective gloves and earplugs, a worker feeds lengths of wood into a machine that makes an earsplitting whine as it automatically cuts a groove into the end of each piece.",
      "Nearby, stacks of wooden wedges wait to be slotted into those grooves to form the beginnings of a hockey stick. Further down the Roustan Hockey production line, other workers are busy shaping, trimming, sanding, painting and screen printing as they turn lumber into a Canadian national symbol.",
      "It's a typical day on the job for the 15 workers at Canada's last major hockey stick factory, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southwest of Toronto.",
      "The operation has origins that date back to the 1800s and has survived decades of trade globalization to hang on as the last North American commercial manufacturer of traditional wooden hockey sticks. Now it's facing fresh headwinds from the trade war launched by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has ripped up free trade deals in North America and imposed tariffs on Canadian exports.",
      "The uncertainty is making life a headache for Roustan.",
      "\u201cYou never know\u201d what Trump will do, said Bo Crawford, the factory's general manager. \u201cYou just have to roll with it and the president of the U.S. can change his mind day to day, week to week, hour to hour. So yeah, we have to deal with it the best we can,\" he said.",
      "Roustan has spent months dealing with U.S. customer worries and navigating the trade challenges.",
      "Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian imports, though many goods have ultimately remained exempted because they're already covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement negotiated during his first term.",
      "Then, in late August, the Trump administration eliminated a widely used customs exemption for international shipments worth $800 that resulted in new uncertainty over cross-border trade, said owner and CEO Graeme Roustan.",
      "\u201cEven if somebody buys one or two or five or 10 sticks and it\u2019s under $100, they\u2019re going to be affected by the tariffs, so the jury is still out on how that\u2019s going to impact business,\u201d Roustan said.",
      "Roustan Hockey's factory churns out about 400,000 wooden hockey sticks a year under the Christian, Northland and Sherwood brands, with about 100,000 exported to the United States. It also makes plastic-bladed road hockey sticks and foam-core goalie sticks.",
      "Crawford said shipments to the U.S. have been held up for manual inspections at the border, where they've been hit with surprise tariffs, which the company's customs broker has managed to get waived.",
      "It's not just sticks. Shipments of goalie pads, which Roustan manufactures at a separate factory in Toronto, were recently flagged for an unexpected 200% tariff, which company managers said they're trying to resolve with new forms from their shipping company.",
      "The disruption underscores the broader trade turmoil that's left the Canadian economy reeling.",
      "Canada's economy shrank 1.6% in the second quarter, in the first contraction since 2023 and the biggest decline since the COVID-19 pandemic. Exports slumped 7.5%, as uncertainty over tariffs and trade pummeled exports to the country's biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "Those figures overshadow the longer-term decline of Canadian manufacturing. Some 37,800 manufacturing jobs were lost in the year to August, according to official data.",

      "\u201cHow did we get here? Years of excessive regulation, and a chronic lack of ambition by successive governments in promoting domestic transformation of our natural resources\u2014recently made worse by Washington\u2019s protectionist agenda,\u201d wrote economists St\u00e9fane Marion and Matthieu Arseneau. \"That failure has eroded Canada\u2019s manufacturing base and left us at risk of becoming irrelevant in global supply chains.\u201d",
      "The Roustan operation started life in 1847 as an agricultural workshop, 20 years before Canada became a country and 70 years before the National Hockey League was created.",
      "It's all that survives of the golden era of North American wooden hockey stick manufacturing in the 1970s and \u201980s when there were numerous workshops in Ontario and Quebec, as well as U.S. production centered in Minnesota.",
      "Roustan, a businessman who also owns the Hockey News and once attempted to buy the Montreal Canadiens, acquired the operation in 2019 \u2014 by then named Heritage Wood Specialties \u2014 and moved it from aging facilities in the town of Hespeler, 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of Brantford, hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky.",
      "Nowadays, global production amounts to about 5 million hockey sticks a year, but wood makes up only about a tenth. No NHL player has regularly used a wooden stick in well over a decade, underlining the sport's embrace of newer technology.",
      "Composite sticks, made of carbon fiber and other lightweight advanced materials, are now far more popular and preferred by both amateurs and professionals. But composite sticks are pricier because of the advanced manufacturing processes involved.",
      "Meanwhile, over the years, Canadian and U.S. production consolidated or moved to Asia and Mexico amid a wider global shift by Western consumer brands in search of cheaper manufacturing overseas.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to compete against some of the Asian markets and some of our competitors that are in other countries,\" said Crawford. \u201cBut our quality kind of stands for itself.\u201d",
      "Roustan acknowledges that the wooden hockey stick market is not a growth industry and, at best, production will hold steady.",
      "\u201cRight now, we have, you know, 5-10% of the market. But it\u2019s diminishing every year. And the kids that are growing up today, they are all about composite. So yes, it\u2019s a shrinking market for sure.\u201d",
      "At Roustan's 130,000 square foot factory, the manufacturing process is low-tech and artisanal.",
      "At one workstation, a worker uses liquid epoxy to glue fiberglass reinforcing sheets to wooden blades, in batches of six. Nearby, another worker uses a band saw to trim dried excess fiberglass off each blade. In the paint room, sticks are dipped in white paint and then hung on a line of moving hooks to dry.",
      "The factory's story is not just about evolving trade patterns and modern industrial practices, but also about the place that the national winter sport has in the Canadian soul, Roustan said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to any country to have a manufacturing base of products that you consume on a regular basis,\u201d said Roustan. \u201cHaving a factory that makes hockey sticks in Canada really serves two purposes. One, it contributes to the manufacturing base. But two, (it) has the legacy and the tug of the heartstrings of the game that we all love in Canada.\u201d",

      "They are the latest of more than 40 deportees sent to Africa since July after the Trump administration struck largely secretive agreements with at least five nations there to take migrants under the new third-country deportation program that rights groups and others have protested.",
      "A lawyer for two of the latest deportees told The Associated Press earlier on Monday that their flight had arrived in the southern African kingdom after departing from Alexandria, Louisiana, and stopping in Puerto Rico, Senegal and Angola.",
      "Tin Thanh Nguyen, the U.S.-based lawyer, said he represents two Vietnamese nationals who were on the flight. He said they had been held at the Alexandria Staging Facility immigration detention center in Louisiana. Nguyen said he tracked their flight with help from rights group Human Rights First.",
      "The Eswatini government confirmed in a statement that 10 deportees had arrived and \u201chave been securely accommodated in one of the country\u2019s correctional facilities.\u201d It didn't name them, give details on their nationalities or say where they are being held. It said they were \u201cin good health and undergoing admission processes.\u201d",
      "Four men from Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen who were deported to Eswatini in mid-July have been held in the country's maximum-security Matsapha prison without charge for nearly three months, their lawyers have said. Nguyen represents two of those men.",
      "The U.S. said the men sent to Eswatini in July were convicted criminals who had deportation orders. A Jamaican man in that first group was repatriated to his home country last month.",
      "After the arrival of the latest deportees, the Eswatini government said it \u201cremains committed to the humane treatment of all persons in its custody.\u201d",
      "The four men have been allowed to make phone calls to their families and lawyers in the U.S. However, authorities haven't allowed an Eswatini-based lawyer to visit them. The lawyer won a court ruling on Friday granting him access but the government immediately appealed, blocking him from visiting them.",
      "U.S. authorities have referred questions over the men's treatment to officials in Eswatini, a small kingdom bordering South Africa where the king holds absolute power and has been accused of clamping down on pro-democracy movements.",
      "Few details of the deportation deals struck between the U.S. and African countries have been released, but international rights group Human Rights Watch has said it has seen documents that show the U.S. will pay Eswatini $5.1 million as part of an agreement to take up to 160 deportees.",

      "The main stud for his owner, food vendor and farmer Thawatchai Daeng-Ngam, Tod was one of the competitors Monday at the annual water buffalo racing festival in Chonburi, a city about an hour drive from Bangkok.",
      "Formerly considered humble draft animals, water buffaloes have become prized show animals in Thailand. They are celebrated at the festival, held at the end of the 11th lunar month to celebrate the beginning of the harvest season and put a spotlight on the animals that once were vital to Thai agriculture.",
      "These days tractors have replaced buffaloes, once prized for their strength and ability to plow fields and transport heavy loads. If the animals are not competing in shows, they are sold for meat.",
      "Buffaloes were the main attraction at the fair in Chonburi, which kicked off with a parade featuring students performing traditional Thai dance. Some of the buffaloes wore flower crowns as they pulled traditional wooden carriages with wheels 2 meters (6.5 feet) tall carrying their owners and women dressed in traditional Thai garb.",
      "The festival also featured a race with buffaloes ridden by jockeys sprinting down a 100-meter (328-foot) track.",
      "Pitun Rassamee came to compete with his 3-year-old buffalo with white fur. The albino already had won local competitions and he hoped Lookaew, meaning marble in Thai, would place in the top five.",
      "There was good reason to be hopeful. Another albino Thai buffalo was sold in 2024 for 18 million baht ($672,000) after winning multiple pageants.",
      "The shift from farm animals to prized symbols has been a gradual one accompanying the mechanization of farming. Thailand's water buffalo population was in decline for a time.",
      "But the contests have injected new interest in the animals, as well as a new industry enjoying government support. The Thai government designated a Thai Buffalo Conservation Day beginning in 2017 and local governments now provide breeding assistance to farmers.",
      "Thawatchai, the food vendor who owns Tod, said raising the buffalo for competition was only a hobby. He lets it roam freely on his family's farm and was only at the festival to see how Tod measured up with others.",

      "In Chonburi, the buffalo-centered events are not new, said Papada Srisophon, an assistant to the chief of a village near a livestock center where farmers learn techniques to raise the animals.",
      "\u201cEach year it has become bigger and bigger,\" Papada said, explaining the contests are an incentive for the farmers to keep raising the animals. \u201cWithout this activity, they won\u2019t know what to do with their buffaloes, and they won\u2019t be motivated to keep their buffaloes.\u201d",
      "At the Chonburi beauty pageant, the owners and caretakers waited with their buffaloes in shaded pens. Fire trucks delivered water for the animals while festival visitors posed for pictures with the biggest animals and families with small children gathered in the stands.",
      "Caretakers then corralled the large animals into a designated pen where judges wearing bolo ties and cowboy hats inspected the contestants.",
      "Many of the owners entering buffaloes in the competition said they grew up with the gentle animals and still valued them, even if they could no longer be of use on the farm.",

      "Takaichi, 64, immediately needs to seek ways to get her long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stay in power and regain public support by delivering measures to address inflation and diplomatic challenges such as U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "A staunch supporter of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \u2019s conservative vision, Takaichi is on the verge of losing her party\u2019s long-time coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed dovish centrist Komeito, because of her ultra-conservative politics. Those include a revisionism of wartime history and regular visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of militarism.",
      "She faces the dilemma of sticking to her ideology and losing the coalition partner or shifting to the center, which would lose her fans of her hawkish politics.",
      "The LDP and opposition parties are currently considering convening the parliament in mid-October to formally elect a new prime minister.",
      "Takaichi is likely to be Japan\u2019s leader because the LDP, even without a majority in either house of parliament following consecutive election losses, is still by far the largest in the lower house, which decides the national leader, and because opposition groups are highly splintered.",
      "She will need to address rising prices to restore support for the struggling party.",
      "She also faces another big test when she hosts a possible summit later this month with Trump as his trip to Asia to attend international conferences is planned.",
      "In her first press conference Saturday as LDP leader, Takaichi vowed to ensure strengthening of the Japan-U.S. alliance as essential to her country\u2019s diplomacy and security, while also seeking to expand trilateral partnerships including South Korea, Australia and the Philippines.",
      "Takaichi said she will honor the tariffs and investment agreements between the government of the current prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba and the Trump administration.",
      "One of Takaichi\u2019s most urgent tasks is to secure cooperation from the opposition. The LDP seeks to expand its current coalition with the moderate centrist Komeito to include at least one of the key opposition parties, which are center-right.",

      "In a rare move that shakes their 26-year-partnership, Komeito leader Tetsuo Saito told Takaichi on Saturday that his party has \u201cbig worry and concern\" about her positions and would not stay in the coalition unless these positions are dropped.",
      "As new party president, Takaichi\u2019s first job is to decide a lineup of top LDP party posts, which she is expected to announce Tuesday.",
      "Takaichi has turned to the LDP\u2019s most powerful kingmaker and former prime minister Taro Aso, a conservative who backed her and reportedly influenced Saturday\u2019s party vote. She is expected to appoint him as deputy prime minister and name his brother-in-law and former Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki as party secretary general.",
      "Aso on Monday met with a senior official of the key opposition Democratic Party for the People about possible cooperation. Another opposition party, Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai, had been open to a coalition under Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who lost to Takaichi in Saturday's runoff vote, but that is now up in the air.",
      "Political watchers say Takaichi is considering appointing those who voted for her in the runoff as a reward. Among them is Toshimitsu Motegi, who is close to Aso and has served in key ministerial posts including as foreign and trade ministers. He is being considered for the position of top diplomat.",
      "Takaichi has also suggested appointing a number of former Abe faction lawmakers implicated in slush funds and other scandals to senior posts, despite public criticism over the party's lack of reform measures and subsequent election losses.",
      "Yoshihiko Noda, head of the largest opposition, centrist Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, criticized the idea, calling it \u201ctotally unthinkable.\"",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will meet with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at a time when one of the world\u2019s most durable and amicable alliances has been fractured by Trump\u2019s trade war and annexation threats",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will meet with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Tuesday at a time when one of the world\u2019s most durable and amicable alliances has been fractured by Trump's trade war and annexation threats.",
      "Carney's second visit to the White House comes ahead of a review next year of the free trade agreement, which is critical to Canada's economy. More than 77% of Canada's exports go to the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s talk of making Canada the 51st state and his tariffs have Canadians feeling an undeniable sense of betrayal. Relations with Canada\u2019s southern neighbor and longtime ally haven\u2019t been worse.",
      "\u201cWe've had ups and downs, but this is the lowest point in relations that I can recall,\u201d said Frank McKenna, a former Canadian ambassador to the United States and current deputy chairman of TD Bank.",
      "\u201cCanadians aren't being instructed what to do; they are simply voting with their feet,\" he said. \"I talk every day to ordinary citizens who are changing their vacation plans, and I talk to large business owners who are moving reward trips away or executive business trips. There is an outright rebellion.\"",
      "There is fear in Canada over what will happen to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Carney is looking to get some relief on some sector-specific tariffs, but expectations are low.",
      "\u201cImproving relations with the White House ahead of the USMCA review is certainly an objective of the trip, but opposition parties and part of the Canadian public will criticize Prime Minister Carney if he doesn\u2019t achieve some progress on the tariff front at this stage,\u201d said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "Trump said Monday that he anticipated Carney wanted to use the meeting to discuss trade.",
      "\u201cI guess he\u2019s going to ask about tariffs, because a lot of companies from Canada are moving into the United States,\u201d Trump told reporters after signing an executive order related to Alaska. \u201cHe\u2019s losing a lot of companies in Canada.\u201d",

      "Carney has said the USMCA, which is up for review in 2026, is an advantage for Canada at a time when it is clear that the U.S. is charging for access to its market. Carney has said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA means that over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be free of tariffs. He said the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods is 5.6% and remains the lowest among all its trading partners.",
      "But Trump has some sector-specific tariffs on Canada, known as Section 232 tariffs, that are having an impact. There are 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, for example.",
      "McKenna said he is hearing Canada might get some relief in steel and aluminum. \u201cIt could be 50% to 25% or agreeing on tariff-free quotas to allow the steel and aluminum to go through at last year's levels,\u201d he said.",
      "The ties between the two countries are without parallel. About $2.5 billion (nearly $3.6 billion Canadian) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. There is close cooperation on defense, border security and law enforcement, and a vast overlap in culture, traditions and pastimes.",
      "About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",
      "\u201cThe bigger prize would be getting a mutual agreement to negotiate as quickly as possible the free trade relationship,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cIf the United States were to threaten us with the six months' notice of termination, I think it would represent a deep chill all across North America.\"",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "Epic, the maker of the Fortnite game, lost a similar antitrust case targeting Apple's iPhone app store. Even though U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers concluded the iPhone app store wasn't an illegal monopoly, she ordered Apple to begin allowing links to alternative payment systems as part of a shake-up that resulted in the company being held in civil contempt of court earlier this year.",

      "Controllers are expected to continue working without a paycheck, Duffy said, so they are now worried about how to pay their bills in addition to worrying about keeping flights safe. And there have started to be instances of controllers calling out sick, leading to delays at several airports Monday.",
      "\u201cNow what they think about as they\u2019re controlling our airspace is, how am I going to pay my mortgage? How do I make my car payment? I have a couple kids at home. How do I put food on the table? I\u2019m working six days a week. Do I have to take a second job and drive Uber when I\u2019m already exhausted from doing a job that\u2019s already stressful to think about how I can make extra money because the government may not provide me a paycheck?\u201d Duffy said.",

      "Duffy said there has already been a small uptick in controllers calling out sick in a few places. Anytime that gets worse and creates a shortage of controllers, the FAA reduces the number of takeoffs and landings to ensure controllers aren't overwhelmed and the system remains safe. But that creates delays and possibly cancellations. Near the end of the 35-day shutdown during the first Trump administration, there were widespread flight delays because of shortages of controllers.",
      "By Monday evening, the FAA was reporting that staffing shortages were creating delays in the Burbank, Newark and Denver airports. The worst problems were in Burbank, where California Gov. Gavin Newsom said no controllers were on duty during the evening, leading to average delays of two-and-a-half hours at that airport.",
      "The Essential Air Service program that subsidizes airline service to small communities across the country will also quickly run out of money. Duffy said that program enjoys strong bipartisan support and provides an important lifeline to many small communities. It is especially important in Alaska, where flying is the only way to travel between many communities.",
      "\u201cThat money runs out this Sunday. So there\u2019s many small communities across the country that will now no longer have the resources to make sure they have air service in their community,\u201d Duffy said.",

      "India's leading body of pilots is asking the country\u2019s civil aviation regulator to investigate the Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet for electrical issues after one of the planes abruptly deployed an emergency power system midair over the weekend",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 India\u2019s leading body of pilots has asked the civil aviation regulator to inspect all Boeing 787 Dreamliners operating in the country for electrical issues after one of the planes abruptly deployed an emergency power system midair over the weekend.",
      "The device, a small propeller that acts as a backup generator and which is known as the ram air turbine, or RAT, normally would be activated when an aircraft's engines lose power, its hydraulic systems register critically low pressure or its electrical systems fail.",
      "However, the RAT engaged unexpectedly on Saturday aboard Air India flight 117 from the northern Indian city of Amritsar moments before it landed safely in Birmingham, England.",
      "The Federation of Indian Pilots, which represents about 6,000 pilots, asked for the investigation Sunday evening.",
      "Air India, owned by business conglomerate Tata Group, said in a statement that an initial inspection following the weekend incident found that \u201call electrical and hydraulic parameters were normal\u201d and that the aircraft landed safely.",
      "The midair deployment of the emergency device has reignited concerns in India over the safety of the Dreamliner. In June, an Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for London crashed in the northwestern city of Ahmedabad, killing 260 people including 19 on the ground, in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",

      "A preliminary report into the June 12 crash found that the fuel control switches for the engines were moved from the \u201crun\u201d to the \u201ccutoff\u201d position moments before impact, starving both engines of fuel. The RAT system activated as it was supposed to have done when the plane lost power and engine thrust, the report said.",
      "Charanvir Singh Randhawa, president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, said that he'd never heard of the RAT system being deployed even when there are no problems in the engines, hydraulics or electrical systems, as appeared to be the case over the weekend. \"It\u2019s a serious concern that warrants a detailed inquiry,\u201d he said.",
      "Randhawa, whose career spans five decades in aviation, wrote an email to India\u2019s Directorate General of Civil Aviation on Sunday, apprising it of the incident and urging an investigation into the electrical systems of all Boeing Dreamliners operating in India.",
      "A spokesman for India\u2019s Civil Aviation Ministry didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and a spokeswoman for Boeing India was not immediately available for comment.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 It's the life of a saleswoman. Taylor Swift's 12th studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales \u2014 which include physical and digital formats \u2014 in its first day in the U.S. That's according to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company.",
      "The album was released Friday.",
      "The sales are impressive for a number of reasons. Swift has broken her record for most first week sales... in one day. Her last album, 2024's \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d amassed 2.61 million equivalent album units in the U.S. in its first week.",
      "\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d has also become the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era, since Luminate began tracking sales in 1991. That was also accomplished in just one day.",
      "Currently, Adele's \u201c25,\u201d which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015 in the U.S., holds the top spot.",
      "Also, according to Luminate, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d has already broken the record for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week in the U.S., with 1.2 million copies. The previous record holder? \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d which sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week.",
      "Swift's many variants may have something to do with the album's economic success. One of her major partners, Target, carries three CD variants, titled as \u201cIt\u2019s Frightening,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Rapturous\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Beautiful\u201d editions.

      "It\u2019s too soon to tell for sure, but the Dubai chocolate movement seems to have put down roots and is spreading at a brisk clip. The sweet flavors and thick texture that have made Dubai chocolate bars a hit are morphing into other kinds of confections too.",
      "Let\u2019s back up for a minute. The original and now-classic Dubai chocolate bar was created by Fix Chocolatier in the United Arab Emirates in 2021, and by 2023 had exploded on social media. Rich and indulgent, it features a thick, milk chocolate shell usually encasing a creamy pistachio (and often tahini) filling mixed with crispy, shredded, phyllo-like pastry called kadayif.",
      "Global brands and small bakers alike are riffing on the concept with different flavors, translating the concept to croissants, milkshakes and more. Fillings range from peanut butter and jelly to s\u2019mores to matcha.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t call this a \u2018trend\u2019 anymore \u2014 it\u2019s a whole new thing,\u201d said Din Allall, whose family business, The Nuts Factory, has about 150 U.S. stores featuring nuts, dried fruits and candies.",

      "It's not just the flavors that make Dubai chocolate different, Allall says, but the bar's structure too \u2014 \"huge, thick, with lots of filling.\"",
      "Trader Joe\u2019s carries a Dubai chocolate bar made by Patislove. IHOP introduced a limited-time Dubai pancake stack in some locations in August. Baskin-Robbins has some Dubai-inspired ice cream products on its menu, while Costco sells a range of Dubai chocolate confections, including a Dubai chocolate cake. Walmart and QVC also sell Dubai chocolate.",
      "Swiss chocolate giant Lindt has a bar, and drew crowds when it debuted a limited number of them in Europe last fall.",
      "\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the crunch,\" said Erica Lefkowits, who was buying some Dubai chocolate recently in Dublin. \"The chocolate is soft and melty, and the filling is creamy, and then the crunch of the kadayif. It\u2019s all about the texture. Plus, it\u2019s sugar.\u201d",
      "She was a little annoyed at the price, higher than your average chocolate bar. Part of Dubai chocolate's appeal, though, is the way it feels simultaneously indulgent and worldly. Pistachios, rose, saffron and cardamom bring luxury, travel and exoticism to the chocolate party.",

      "American distillers have gotten a costly cold shoulder from Canada",
      "American distillers have gotten a costly cold shoulder from Canada, where their exports plunged 85% earlier this year \u2014 topping broad declines in key international markets amid global trade tensions, a spirits industry group said Monday.",
      "Even a thaw in trade relations may not shake this hangover right away.",
      "\u201cEven though things have eased up, we still are not back on the shelf in Canada,\u201d said Kentucky craft distiller Tom Bard. \u201cProbably won't be for a good long while.\u201d",
      "The majority of Canadian provinces continue to ban American spirits from shelves, though Canada removed its retaliatory tariff on the products weeks ago, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said. There's another nagging concern \u2014 that consumer reaction to the trade conflicts could curb the international thirst for American spirits in key markets.",
      "Overall exports of American spirits fell 9% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to a year ago, the council said in its new report. Sharp declines occurred in other crucial markets \u2014 the European Union, United Kingdom and Japan, it said. That comes on the heels of a banner year for U.S. spirits exports in 2024, the council said. Total first-quarter exports in 2025 edged up by 1% from a year ago.",
      "In the ultracompetitive spirits world, the sudden drop-off is a dispiriting development for U.S. distillers.",
      "\"There\u2019s a growing concern that our international consumers are increasingly opting for domestically produced spirits or imports from countries other than the U.S., signaling a shift away from our great American spirits brands,\u201d Chris Swonger, the council\u2019s CEO, said Monday in a release.",
      "Canada remains the only key trading partner that retaliated against U.S. spirits in the latest rounds of trade conflicts spurred by President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The president maintains that open trade cost the U.S. millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to American-made prosperity.",
      "But American distilled spirits have been a high-profile target for retaliation.",
      "Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs on European steel and aluminum spurred the EU to retaliate with a tariff that caused American whiskey exports to the EU to plunge, costing distillers more than $100 million in revenue from 2018 to 2021, the council has said. Once the tariff was suspended, EU sales rebounded for American distillers \u2014 until the latest tensions resurfaced in the first year of Trump's second term.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council is pressing for free-flowing trade for distilled spirits with zero-for-zero tariffs with key markets, saying it would give American distillers the certainty they need.",
      "Global markets are increasingly vital for producers of American whiskey \u2014 which includes bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey. The sector faces a supply-and-demand crunch in the U.S., where a sales slowdown is coinciding with massive stockpiles of whiskey, the council said.",
      "\u201cWith the slowdown in the U.S. market, it\u2019s more important than ever for American distillers to have reliable access to international markets,\" Swonger said. \"Until these trade issues are fully resolved, many distillers are remaining on the sidelines, fearful that without a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs, they could once again face retaliatory tariffs. They simply don\u2019t want to risk jeopardizing the investments they\u2019d need to make to reestablish their presence abroad.\u201d",

      "The pain was felt across a range of spirits categories, with quarterly declines of 13% for American whiskey, 14% for vodka, 15% for cordials and 12% for brandy, it said.",
      "The declines were softened somewhat by surging sales to other countries \u2014 including Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Singapore and South Korea, the council said.",

      "At the start of 2025, their products were sold in British Columbia and Alberta, and they were in talks to expand to other Canadian provinces.

      "President Donald Trump, when asked on Sunday night when federal workers would be fired as he has threatened, told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s taking place right now, and it\u2019s all because of the Democrats.\u201d He declined to answer a question about which agencies are subject to the cuts.",
      "The possibility of layoffs escalates an already tense situation in which Washington lawmakers have struggled to find common ground and build mutual trust. Leaders in both parties are betting that public sentiment has swung their way, putting pressure on the other side to cave.",

      "The House is not expected to be in session this week, focusing attention on the Senate to take the lead on any deal in the Republican-led Congress. Yet even with House lawmakers away, the Republican and Democratic leaders have been holding almost daily briefings as they frame their arguments and seek to shift blame for the shutdown.",
      "Democrats are insisting on renewing subsidies to cover health insurance costs for millions of households, while Trump wants to preserve existing spending levels as he believes that Democrats will have to fold because of the jobs and federal infrastructure and energy projects being put at risk.",
      "The stalemate comes at a moment of troubling economic uncertainty. While the U.S. economy has continued to grow this year, hiring has slowed and inflation remains elevated as the Republican president's import taxes have created a series of disruptions for businesses and hurt confidence in his leadership. At the same time, there is a recognition that the nearly $2 trillion annual budget deficit is financially unsustainable.",
      "House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, among those appearing on the Sunday news shows, said there have been no talks with Republican leaders since their White House meeting on Sept. 29. He said since then Republicans, including Trump, \u201chave gone radio silent.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration sees the shutdown as an opening to wield greater power over the budget, with multiple officials saying they will save money as workers are furloughed by imposing permanent job cuts on thousands of government workers, a tactic that has never been used before.",
      "Even though it would be Trump's choice to cut jobs, he believes he can put the blame on the Democrats because of the shutdown.",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California defended his party's stance on the shutdown, saying the possible increase in health care costs for millions of Americans would make insurance unaffordable in what he called a \u201ccrisis.\u201d",
      "But Schiff also noted that the Trump administration has stopped congressionally approved spending. That essentially undermines the value of Democrats trying to seek compromises on the budget since the administration could block the spending of money from any deal. The Trump administration sent Congress roughly $4.9 billion in what are called pocket rescissions on foreign aid, a process that meant the money was withheld without time for Congress to weigh in before the previous fiscal year ended last month.",

      "Other key positions in the new cabinet, announced by President Emmanuel Macron 's office, remain largely unchanged, with conservative Bruno Retailleau staying on as interior minister, in charge of policing and internal security, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot remaining as foreign minister, and G\u00e9rald Darmanin keeping the justice ministry.",
      "But the life span of Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu\u2019s new minority government risks being short, facing hostility in Parliament where it lacks a stable majority.

      "President Donald Trump is making plans for a significant aid package for U.S. soybean farmers",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is planning a significant aid package to U.S. soybean farmers to help them survive China\u2019s boycott of American beans in response to his trade war even as the president says he is still seeking a soybean deal with Beijing.",
      "But farmers are worried that time is quickly running out to reach a deal in time to sell any of this year's crop to their biggest customer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday said on CNBC that the public could expect news of \u201csubstantial support for our farmers, especially the soybean farmers\u201d as soon as Tuesday.",
      "Details of the aid package are unknown, but it would come as the world\u2019s two largest economies have been unable to reach a trade deal and China has halted purchases of U.S. beans. China, the biggest foreign buyer of American soybeans for many years, last bought American beans in May and has not bought any for this harvest season, which began in September.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be meeting with President Xi, of China, in four weeks, and Soybeans will be a major topic of discussion,\" Trump wrote.",
      "The soybeans that China imports largely for oil extraction and animal feed are an important crop for U.S. agriculture because they are the top U.S. food export, accounting for about 14% of all farm goods sent overseas and China has been buying 25% of all American soybeans in recent years.",
      "U.S. farmers grew $60.7 billion worth of soybeans, or nearly 4.3 billion bushels, in the 2022-2023 marketing year, according to the American Soybean Association. Just over half were exported. Illinois is the top soybean growing state, but Iowa, Nebraska and Minnesota are also large producers.",
      "Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping, to be held at the end of October in South Korea.",
      "In Trump's first trade war with China, he gave American farmers more than $22 billion in aid payments in 2019 and nearly $46 billion in 2020, though the latter also included aid related to the COVID pandemic.",
      "Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer who serves as president of the American Soybean Association, welcomed Trump acknowledging the difficulties faced by farmers. He said actions are needed to prevent many farmers from going out of business.",
      "Before the trade war, farmers were already pinched by high costs and low crop prices, he said. Then, their biggest customer vanished.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that we\u2019re being used as a bargaining chip in this trade war that\u2019s not of our own doing,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "He said time is running low for the two governments to strike a deal, because China has already ordered soybeans from countries such as Brazil and Argentina for deliveries through December and, if there's no soybean deal soon, China could skip the U.S. entirely.",
      "\u201cIf they get another couple months, they\u2019re into new crop soybeans in Brazil and Argentina. And they\u2019re going to bypass us altogether if we\u2019re not careful,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "China has slapped 20% tariffs on U.S. soybeans since Trump announced his tariffs on the world in the spring, making U.S. beans uncompetitive in price.",

      "Argentina is a sore subject for U.S. farmers right now because on September 24, Beijing took advantage of a tax holiday in Argentina and ordered nearly 2 million tons of Argentine soybean and soy products. The tax holiday came after the U.S. signaled it would provide a $20 billion support package to help stabilize the Latin American country\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cThat situation was angering to many farmers,\u201d Ragland said. \u201cAnd while I don\u2019t think the specific intent was just to give a big chunk, give $20 billion to Argentina so that they could send China soybeans. That was the result. And the optics of it look absolutely terrible.\u201d",
      "Government aid might be necessary to help farmers get through this year if they cannot sell to China, but farmers say they would rather sell their crops on the market.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely tighten the belt, to look at the inputs, look at the previous investments I made in fertilizer and see if I can stretch another year or two out of them to reduce costs but maintain the same yield projections, run equipment longer,\u201d Mackenthun said.",

Some critics have made parallels between that bubble, which saw the S&P 500 eventually halve in value, and the recent AI bonanza.",
      "It's not just the big household names in the S&P 500 index raising concern. Ann Miletti, head of equity investments for Allspring Global Investments, has been struck by how much stock prices have shot up for speculative kinds of stocks, such as smaller, money-losing companies.

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 More than 800,000 drivers for ride-hailing companies in California will soon be able to join a union and bargain collectively for better wages and benefits under a measure signed Friday by Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Supporters said the new law will open a path for the largest expansion of private sector collective bargaining rights in the state's history. The legislation is a significant compromise in the yearslong battle between labor unions and tech companies.",
      "California is the second state where Uber and Lyft drivers can unionize as independent contractors. Massachusetts voters passed a ballot referendum in November allowing unionization, while drivers in Illinois and Minnesota are pushing for similar rights.",
      "Newsom announced the signing at an unrelated news conference at University of California, Berkeley. The new law will give drivers \u201cdignity and a say about their future,\u201d he said.",
      "The new law is part of an agreement made in September between Newsom, state lawmakers and the Service Employees International Union, along with rideshare companies Uber and Lyft. In exchange, Newsom also signed a measure supported by Uber and Lyft to significantly cut the companies' insurance requirements for accidents caused by underinsured drivers.",
      "Lyft CEO David Risher said in September that the new insurance rates are expected to save the company $200 million and could help reduce fares.",
      "Uber and Lyft fares in California are consistently higher than in other parts of the U.S. because of insurance requirements, the companies say. Uber has said that nearly one-third of every ride fare in the state goes toward paying for state-mandated insurance.",
      "Labor unions and tech companies have fought for years over drivers' rights. In July of last year, the California Supreme Court ruled that app-based ride-hailing and delivery services like Uber and Lyft can continue treating their drivers as independent contractors not entitled to benefits like overtime pay, paid sick leave and unemployment insurance. A 2019 law mandated that Uber and Lyft provide drivers with benefits, but voters reversed it at the ballot in 2020.",
      "The collective bargaining measure now allows rideshare workers in California to join a union while still being classified as independent contractors and requires gig companies to bargain in good faith. The new law doesn\u2019t apply to drivers for delivery apps like DoorDash.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 From Wall Street trading floors to the Federal Reserve to economists sipping coffee in their home offices, the first Friday morning of the month typically brings a quiet hush around 8:30 a.m. eastern as everyone awaits the Labor Department's crucial monthly jobs report.",
      "But with the government shut down, no information was released Friday about hiring in September.",
      "It's the first time since a government shutdown in 2013 that the jobs report has been delayed. During the 2018-2019 partial government closure, the Labor Department was one of several agencies that remained open because Congress had agreed to fund them. September's jobs figures will be released eventually, once the shutdown ends.",
      "The interruption in the data has occurred at a particularly uncertain time, when policymakers at the Federal Reserve and Wall Street investors would need more data on the economy, rather than less. Hiring has ground nearly to a halt, threatening to drag down the broader economy. Yet at the same time, consumers \u2014 particularly higher-income earners \u2014 are still spending and some businesses are ramping up investments in data centers developing artificial intelligence models. Whether that is enough to revive hiring remains to be seen.",
      "For now, economists are turning to alternative measures of the job market provided by nonprofits and private-sector companies.

      "What was worse for the Bills' quarterback is knowing how much of a hand he and his teammates played in the 23-20 loss on Sunday night.",
      "As if three turnovers, two by Allen, were not enough: The offense came up short on a final drive that stalled at New England\u2019s 27, leaving Buffalo settling for Matt Prater hitting a game-tying 45-yard field goal with 2:17 left.",
      "\u201cWe just played sloppy,\u201d Allen said. \u201cNot gonna win a football game, turning the ball over three times ... That\u2019s just bad football and we just did not play good tonight.\u201d",
      "In dropping to 4-1, Buffalo joined the Philadelphia Eagles, who lost to Denver, in being the NFL\u2019s final two unbeaten teams to lose on Sunday. The outcome also ended Buffalo's regular-season home winning streak at 14, one short of matching the team record.",
      "And suddenly the five-time defending AFC East champions find themselves in a divisional race that has the upstart Patriots (3-2) on their heels.",
      "\u201cRespect to them. They came in, they knew what they had to do. They took care of the football. We didn\u2019t,\u201d Allen said.",
      "The first sign of trouble came on Buffalo\u2019s opening drive, which ended with Allen losing a fumble on a botched handoff to Dawson Knox at midfield. Two series later, wide receiver Keon Coleman lost a fumble, which the Patriots recovered at Buffalo\u2019s 11.",
      "Credit the Bills' defense for limiting the Patriots to a field goal off the first two turnovers.",
      "The turning point, however, came with Allen\u2019s interception in the third quarter. Trailing 13-10 and facing second-and-13 at New England\u2019s 19, Allen forced a throw over the middle intended for Khalil Shakir, only to have defensive back Marcus Jones jump in front and pick it off.",

      "Adding salt to the wound was having former Bills star receiver Stefon Diggs finish with 10 catches for 146 yards in his first trip back to Buffalo since being traded to Houston in April 2024. It was the type of outing the Bills were accustomed to seeing Diggs perform in a Buffalo uniform during his four-year stint with the team.",

Before being picked off last week, Allen had committed just one turnover in his previous 12 starts, including playoffs.",
      "The opening-drive turnover came after Buffalo scored touchdowns on the first possession in each of its first four outings this season \u2014 and 12 total, dating to the start of 2024.",
      "The offense struggled overall with New England bottling up Buffalo\u2019s running attack. James Cook was limited to 49 yards rushing and no catches, the first time he\u2019s failed to crack 100 yards from scrimmage this season.

      "Another NFL player gave away a touchdown by carelessly dropping the ball before he crossed the goal line. A roughing-the-kicker penalty erased a touchdown return in a different game. The Super Bowl champions ignored their record-setting running back.",
      "The most egregious play of Week 5 occurred when Cardinals running back Emari Demercado turned a 72-yard touchdown run into a touchback by slowing down near the goal line and releasing the ball as Titans cornerback L\u2019Jarius Sneed swiped at his arm. Officials initially ruled it a touchdown but a video review showed Demercado didn\u2019t have possession when he entered the end zone.",
      "Instead of increasing Arizona\u2019s 21-6 lead, Demercado\u2019s gaffe kept Tennessee in the game. Teammate Dadrion Taylor-Demerson then gave the Titans a chance to win after he intercepted Cam Ward\u2019s pass but fumbled while falling to the ground in a wild play that resulted in a touchdown for Tennessee. Receiver Tyler Lockett fell on the loose ball in the end zone, cutting the Cardinals\u2019 lead to 21-19 with 4:51 left. Joey Slye made a 29-yard field goal as time expired and the Titans beat the Cardinals to snap a 10-game losing streak.",
      "Last week, Colts receiver Adonai Mitchell committed the same costly miscue, which makes Demercado\u2019s blunder even more inexcusable because it should have been on the forefront of every player\u2019s mind. Mitchell held the ball out as he neared the goal line and lost control of it for a touchback, negating what would have been a spectacular 76-yard touchdown reception against the Los Angeles Rams in a 27-20 loss.",
      "\u201cI just made a mistake. Really no excuse,\u201d Demercado told reporters. \u201cObviously emotional. Big play. I just got to be smarter.\u201d",
      "A penalty flag wasn\u2019t thrown on every big play this week but it seemed that way in several games.",
      "The worst may have been the roughing-the-kicker call on Chargers reserve linebacker Marlowe Wax that wiped out a 57-yard punt return touchdown by Ladd McConkey late in the second quarter. Los Angeles led Washington 10-7 at the time. The penalty allowed the Commanders to retain possession and they ended up with a tying field goal on the drive on the way to a 27-10 win.",
      "The Chargers were one of 10 teams that had at least nine penalties. Those teams went 4-6.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s on us to fix that,\u201d Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert said of the penalties. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to win games like that when you\u2019re having penalties like that.\u201d",
      "The Patriots gave the Bills 30 yards on consecutive plays after taking a 20-10 lead in the fourth quarter. After a roughing-the-passer penalty, James Cook was stopped for a 4-yard loss on an excellent play by Harold Landry. But Joshua Farmer inexplicably drilled him seconds after the whistle. Josh Allen tossed a touchdown pass a few plays later but the Patriots ended up handing Buffalo its first loss, 23-20.",

Instead, the duo combined for 13 catches on 18 targets while Saquon Barkley got just six carries in a game in which the Eagles led 10-3 at halftime and 17-3 going into the fourth quarter.",
      "The offense had two possessions with a 14-point lead. Barkley got a carry on one of the 10 plays and a false start stopped it. Jalen Hurts completed 2 of 6 passes, got sacked once and scrambled for 4 yards on another.",
      "Barkley was the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2024 and set an NFL record by rushing for 2,504 yards in the regular season and playoffs. He\u2019s struggled this season but had 30 yards on his six carries and also caught a 47-yard TD pass.",
      "Coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo needed to open up the offense, stretch the field and utilize Brown and Smith more. But giving the ball to the running backs on just nine of 55 plays was surprising and uncharacteristic for a team that had won 20 of its previous 21 games.",
      "\u201cI just think we\u2019re searching for improvement and so given what type of team we\u2019re built to be, we have to be able to establish the run in some regard and that could look different,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cIt may not be what it\u2019s been, but ultimately being able to lean on the run game is important. So we just have to look into how we can improve in that area and go out there and take ownership of the things that we can control and grow from this opportunity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino agreed to hold the World Cup draw in Washington, D.C. This decision was forged during a conversation at a Club World Cup match",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The plan started coming together inside a luxury box at MetLife Stadium.",
      "As the Premier League's Chelsea was on its way to a shutout victory at the Club World Cup final in July, President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino were deep in discussion at the New Jersey sports complex outside New York City on another matter: where the draw for next year's World Cup would be held.",
      "The high-drama spectacle decides which teams will face each other in the group stage of soccer's most prestigious tournament, along with the schedule for competition. It was widely expected to unfold in Las Vegas, home to the 1994 draw when the U.S. last hosted the World Cup and a natural backdrop for glitz. But since at least March, officials had privately discussed bringing the draw to Washington, home to a showman president who regularly hugs the spotlight associated with sports.",
      "So during that July match in the stadium that will also host the final game of next year's World Cup, Trump and Infantino agreed to get going on holding the draw in the U.S. capital \u2014 namely, the Kennedy Center, another institution that Trump reshaped to his liking.",
      "\u201cDuring that Club World Cup final, there was a real seriousness to well, look, if we\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019ve got to do it now,\u201d Andrew Giuliani, executive director of the White House FIFA task force, told The Associated Press. \u201cThat\u2019s when talks heated up between the president and Mr. Infantino in terms of getting this done.\u201d",
      "The collaboration over the draw, slated for Dec. 5, illustrates the bond that has formed between Trump and Infantino, described by the U.S. president as \u201cprobably the most respected man in sports.\" The relationship will come into even sharper focus as the World Cup approaches, jointly hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.",
      "Tickets are now open to fans as major questions hang over the tournament, including how welcome visitors from some countries will be in the U.S. amid its immigration crackdown. Even as the White House pledges openness, Trump has added another uncertainty by suggesting he could move games from cities he thinks are unsafe.",
      "Despite his affinity for sports, Trump is known more for his ties to golf and football than soccer. But his awareness of the sport was spurred in part by his youngest son, Barron, who is such a soccer fan that he had a net in the first lady's garden during Trump's first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest only grew when the U.S. won World Cup hosting rights in 2018. Nothing excites Trump like hosting a major event, and Giuliani recalled that, at the time, the president and his aides were almost wistful that he wouldn\u2019t be in the White House when the tournament arrived, assuming he would be well into a post-presidency following an immediate second term.",
      "Shortly after the U.S. was awarded the tournament, Trump hosted Infantino at the White House. Infantino, who was also serving his first term as FIFA president, made an impression by handing Trump red and yellow penalty cards, joking they could be used on the press.",
      "The relationship flourished in 2020 as both men plotted their futures.",
      "During a dinner that January at the global economic summit in Davos, near FIFA's home in Zurich, Infantino called the U.S. president \u201cmy great friend.\u201d Trump, always appreciative of a compliment, responded by inviting Infantino to a White House signing event for the Abraham Accords, which sought to normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab countries.",
      "The ceremony happened as Infantino was aligning FIFA's sporting and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It followed a pattern of Infantino, much like Trump, cozying up to autocratic leaders.",
      "Infantino appeared to relish public meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin before, during and after that country hosted the 2018 World Cup. Visiting Putin at the Kremlin with a group of soccer greats during the tournament, Infantino said he felt \u201clike a child in a toy shop\u201d in Russia. He collected the Russian Order of Friendship from Putin the following year.",
      "Infantino would later relocate to Doha ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, emerging as a strong defender of the tiny Gulf state that was fiercely criticized for its treatment of the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers needed to build essential stadiums, transport projects and hotels.",
      "As the connection between Trump and Infantino deepened, Joe Biden dashed Trump's hopes of staying in the White House. For the next four years, Infantino's ties to Washington were far more limited. The two leaders had a brief meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022, a fleeting moment FIFA captured with one photo on its website.",
      "Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff also met with Infantino when he traveled for the Women\u2019s World Cup in July 2023.",
      "Preparations for the World Cup under Biden were under the radar by design, according to one senior official for that administration who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Even though the administration had its own World Cup 2026 task force, Biden aides were aware of sensitivities surrounding large gatherings so soon after the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "The Biden White House was also careful not to overtly promote a relationship with FIFA, which had sidelined the U.S. Soccer Federation in its traditional role in coordinating a home World Cup. Instead, it negotiates individually with each of the 11 U.S. host cities on security, ticketing and other matters.",
      "Infantino visited the White House while Biden was president at least once, meeting for about an hour in 2024 with then-national security adviser Jake Sullivan, an avid soccer fan. Biden officials emphasized to Infantino that they wanted to ensure the host cities ultimately benefited from holding World Cup matches and that the U.S.\u2019s human rights values would be respected.",
      "Trump's disappointment about missing out on the World Cup would prove to be unfounded after he was elected to a second, nonconsecutive term last year.",
      "Since that victory, Infantino\u2019s embrace of Trump has been gushing. He promptly congratulated him the day after Election Day, was at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s South Florida club, during the presidential transition and had a prime seat at his January inauguration. Trump called Infantino a \u201cwinner\u201d in a video played at the Miami draw for the Club World Cup in December, which was attended by daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Meanwhile, FIFA has set up shop at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where Infantino worked last month as world leaders gathered nearby for the annual United Nations General Assembly. Infantino and Trump met again last week in New York, along with first lady Melania Trump, according to the FIFA president's Instagram account.",
      "Infantino has teased the idea of Trump doing the draw himself, which Giuliani called the \u201cMAGA-FIFA World Cup draw.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust like a great opera, there will be high drama,\u201d Giuliani said.",
      "Infantino has had more public appearances with Trump than with any soccer officials from the sport\u2019s heartlands of Europe and South America, according to the FIFA leader's schedule and social media posts. He was late for his own FIFA Congress in Paraguay in May because he was with Trump and the Saudi crown prince in the Middle East, a move seen as disrespectful of his own voters and criticized by Europe\u2019s soccer federations.",
      "During Infantino's most recent appearance at Trump's side in the Oval Office on Aug. 22, he took even some fellow soccer officials by surprise when he gifted a gold replica World Cup trophy to the U.S. president, saying it was \u201cfor winners only.\u201d",
      "That handover was unexpected, according to one senior soccer official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive dynamics. Even though it was a replica, the moment was still seen as a snub of World Cup tradition because Trump has held onto a trophy that is supposed to belong to the sport as a whole, not an individual person.",
      "A White House official said the trophy remains in the White House\u2019s possession.",
      "No such offer was publicly extended by FIFA to Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Scheinbaum or Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Mark Carney. Infantino has not met with Carney this year and met Sheinbaum for the first time on Aug. 29.",
      "The episode is a reminder of how Infantino can shift with the moment. The man who remarked in Qatar on the eve of the World Cup in November 2022 that \u201ctoday, I feel (like) a migrant worker\u201d \u2014 comments interpreted as solidarity with migrants \u2014 was laughing along with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this year as they bantered about migrants being unable to scale the repainted wall on the U.S. southern border.",
      "Infantino has framed his close relationship with Trump as \u201ccrucial\u201d to the success of the World Cup, a massive operation that relies on expansive cooperation with federal, state and local governments. Trump's suggestion that he could move the host cities was a reminder that Infantino is working with a famously impulsive president whose whims could expose FIFA to logistical havoc and legal jeopardy if he followed through.",
      "Even without those threats, those involved with World Cup planning said the tournament's stakes are high because it's the first in a series of global sporting events hosted by the U.S., including the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cThis needs to go well in order to show the world that if you want to have the best sports and entertainment events, you want to have them in the United States,\u201d said Alex Lasry, CEO of the New York/New Jersey host committee. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unusual for a White House to be coordinating and be involved, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unusual for the heads of state and for the president to be excited and to be talking about a mega event coming here.\u201d",

      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Receiver Stefon Diggs is quite comfortable putting on a show in Buffalo. The big difference on Sunday night was doing so for the Bills\u2019 division rival New England Patriots.",
      "Diggs had 10 catches for 146 yards, with 119 coming in the second half, in a 23-20 win over the Bills sealed by Andy Borregales hitting a 52-yard field goal with 15 seconds remaining.",

      "\u201cIt was lit, prime time,\" said Diggs, who set nearly every single-season franchise receiving record in Buffalo during his four-year tenure. \u201cIt was electrifying. I knew it was going to be a test for us.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a test the up-and-coming Patriots passed under Maye, the blossoming second-year starter, first-year coach Mike Vrabel and veteran running back Rhamondre Stevenson, who scored on 4- and 7-yard runs.",
      "The Patriots won back-to-back games for the first time since winning three in a row midway through the 2022 season. New England has a winning record through five games for the first time since opening the 2019 season 8-0.",
      "And the Patriots tightened the AFC East race by moving within one game of the five-time defending division champion Bills (4-1).",
      "Maye finished 22 of 30 for 273 yards, and was near-perfect in the second half by going 13 of 14 for 184 yards. No throw was more impressive than when he began the final drive by eluding the grasp of Bills defensive tackle DaQuan Jones and getting off a 12-yard completion to Diggs.",
      "\u201cYou know this was his storybook,\u201d Maye said of the receiver who signed with New England in March, and after his time in Houston was cut short by a torn knee ligament last season.",

      "Rodr\u00edguez hit a tiebreaking RBI double in the eighth inning and the Mariners beat the Detroit Tigers 3-2 in Game 2 of their AL Division Series on Sunday to even the series.",
      "With the game knotted at 2-2 and one out in the bottom of the eighth inning, AL MVP candidate Cal Raleigh doubled with one out. Shortly after, Rodr\u00edguez doubled home Raleigh to put the Mariners in front for good.",
      "\u201cIn games like this, I feel like any situation is clutch,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez, who has recorded an extra-base hit in a franchise-record five consecutive postseason games and has six extra-base hits in his first seven career playoff games.",
      "\u201cI feel like the biggest pride I take is helping the team win. In any situation that I can, I feel like that\u2019s what makes me feel good. And listen, if they want to say that I\u2019m clutch, too, okay. Cool. So be it.\u201d",
      "Closer Andr\u00e8s Mu\u00f1oz retired the Tigers in order for the save one night after throwing two innings in a 3-2 loss in 11 innings.",
      "Jorge Polanco homered twice for Seattle.",
      "After going scoreless against Seattle starter Luis Castillo and three Mariners relievers, the Tigers tied the game against Matt Brash in the top of the eighth.",
      "Gleyber Torres worked a leadoff walk, and Riley Greene reached on a fielder\u2019s choice that was misfielded by Seattle first baseman Josh Naylor for an error. Spencer Torkelson followed up with a double into the right-field corner to tie the score at 2-2.",
      "Seattle regained the lead in the bottom of the inning.",
      "Raleigh, who led the majors in home runs this season with 60, lined Kyle Finnegan's pitch into the right-field corner and slid headfirst into second base. Rodr\u00edguez followed with a double of his own, sending the sellout crowd of 47,431 at T-Mobile Park into a frenzy.",
      "\u201cI give our guys a ton of credit,\u201d Mariners manager Dan Wilson said. \u201cNumber one, this was a bounce-back game for us, and they did just that. And to lose the lead late like that and to come right back and score a run was huge. I thought those at-bats by Julio and Cal were tremendous and just a huge momentum shift back to our dugout.\u201d",
      "Polanco got the Mariners on the board with a one-out solo homer over the wall in left center field in the bottom of the fourth inning. He added another one off reigning AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal with two outs in the sixth.",

      "\u201cI just had a good approach,\u201d said Polanco, who added a single in the eighth and finished 3 for 4. \u201cI stayed through the middle so I could recognize the secondary stuff. Like I said, just put a good swing on it.\u201d",
      "Skubal, who struck out 14 batters to set the AL record for most strikeouts in a postseason game by a left-handed starter while beating Cleveland in Game 1 of the Wild Card Series, fanned nine across seven innings on Sunday. He limited the Mariners to five hits and walked one.",
      "\u201cHis stuff was good,\u201d Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said of Skubal. \u201cPolanco \u2026 hits the homer and hit another homer. You know, you don\u2019t see the same guy get good swings against Tarik very often.",

      "Castillo, meanwhile, maneuvered through 4 2/3 scoreless innings. In the fifth, he surrendered his first hit of the game, a two-out single by Gleyber Torres that put runners on the corners. But left-hander Gabe Speier was summoned to face Game 1 hero Kerry Carpenter and struck him out to end the inning.",
      "Castillo now has a 1.49 career postseason ERA, having given up four earned runs and 18 hits in 24 1/3 innings while striking out 22 and walking five.",

      "His inexcusable gaffe sparked a monumental collapse by the Arizona Cardinals.",
      "Demercado had a 72-yard touchdown wiped away early in the fourth quarter and the Cardinals proceeded to blow a 15-point lead on Sunday, losing to the Tennessee Titans 22-21 on Joey Slye's last-second field goal.",

I know his character, his IQ of the game,\u201d Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think Emari would do that, but we all make mistakes. He\u2019s going to take that on the chin, he understands that. He owns up to that. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s frustrated.\u201d",

      "The third-year running back raced through Tennessee's defense and had a clear path to the end zone before letting up around the 5-yard line as Titans cornerback L\u2019Jarius Sneed closed in fast. Demercado flipped the ball away just as Sneed reached for it, and the officials initially ruled it a touchdown.",
      "A review showed that Demercado let go of the ball just before crossing the goal line, and the Titans were awarded a touchback.",
      "It was the second straight week an NFL player turned a long TD into a touchback by losing the ball just outside the end zone. Indianapolis receiver Adonai Mitchell had a similar gaffe in a loss to the Los Angeles Rams.",

      "Joey Logano has secured the final spot in the next round of the NASCAR playoffs after a dramatic race at Charlotte Motor Speedway",
      "CONCORD, N.C. -- CONCORD, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Joey Logano, winner of two of the last three Cup Series championships, was never part of the conversation of potential elimination from NASCAR playoffs.",
      "At least not until Sunday's race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, where the Team Penske driver found himself struggling most of the race and in a tense battle with Ross Chastain for the final spot in the round of eight.",
      "The two swapped the final transfer spot multiple times as NASCAR prepared to cut the field from 12 drivers to eight ahead of the third round of the playoffs. Chastain was in, then it was Logano, then the two were tied with Logano holding the tie-breaker.",
      "Logano, on fresher tires, worked his way through the field for every point possible. Chastain was nursing old Goodyears and holding off every challenging driver closing quickly in his rearview mirror.",
      "But then came Denny Hamlin, who for the second week in a row played a pivotal role in the finish and the playoff field. A week ago, his hard racing of Bubba Wallace kept Wallace from winning at Kansas Speedway and ultimately led to Wallace being eliminated from the playoffs.",
      "This time it was chasing down Chastain. The two cars had contact, Chastain spun, and crossed the finish line backward in 21st, one spot behind Logano. It was enough to give Logano the final spot in the third round of the playoffs and eliminate Chastain.",
      "An animated Hamlin on pit road complained to his No. 11 crew that he was not made aware of the situation and would not have passed Chastain had he known it would benefit three-time Cup Series champion Logano.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about anything on that last run, I wasn\u2019t very good,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cI saw (Chastain) and I didn\u2019t know anything about anything going on. I didn\u2019t know. I thought I was racing for about 18th. I just wish I knew so I could have been either prepared or made a different decision.\u201d",
      "Shane van Gisbergen, meanwhile, won his fifth consecutive race on a road or street course. Charlotte, called The Roval in this configuration, is a hybrid road course/oval.",
      "The theory headed into Charlotte was that van Gisbergen had the race locked up and the only way a driver below the cutline could save his championship chances was if the New Zealander was beat.",
      "Kyle Larson and Christopher Bell both put tough challenges on van Gisbergen, but van Gisbergen emerged from a car-slamming battle with Larson through the turns with 14 laps remaining and took the lead for good with 11 laps remaining.",
      "That eliminated any shot for Tyler Reddick and Wallace of 23XI Racing, or Austin Cindric of Team Penske, claiming the final playoff position. Chastain of Trackhouse Racing remained in the hunt, though, as Logano couldn't get his Penske Ford running well enough to secure his spot in the playoffs.",
      "\u201cEverybody was telling me how close it was going to be there. We\u2019re still in. We\u2019re still alive, baby,\u201d Logano said as he reveled in a loud chorus of fan booing. \"I knew it was within a point there, and I knew we were going to be tied there at the end and Ross was going to do whatever he had to do to make it happen.",
      "\u201cIf you want drama, the playoffs bring it every time. What an entertaining finish there. We\u2019ve still got a shot.\u201d",
      "It was similar to a year ago when Logano left Charlotte eliminated from the playoffs, only to learn hours later while having dinner with his family that Alex Bowman had been disqualified and Logano was back in the field. He went on to win the Cup Series championship.",
      "\u201cUnforced errors, it's just terrible,\u201d Chastain said of two early race speeding penalties that made him want to \u201cstart the whole day over.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "Epic, the maker of the Fortnite game, lost a similar antitrust case targeting Apple's iPhone app store. Even though U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers concluded the iPhone app store wasn't an illegal monopoly, she ordered Apple to begin allowing links to alternative payment systems as part of a shake-up that resulted in the company being held in civil contempt of court earlier this year.",

      "Although the Play Store changes will likely dent Google's profit, the company makes most of its money from a digital ad network that's anchored by its dominant search engine \u2014 the pillars of an internet empire that has been under attack on other legal fronts.",
      "As part of cases brought by the U.S. Justice Department, both Google's search engine and parts of its advertising technology were declared illegal monopolies, too.",
      "A federal judge in the search engine case earlier this year rejected a proposed break-up outlined by the Justice Department i n a decision that was widely seen as a reprieve for Google. The government is now seeking to break up Google in the advertising technology case during proceedings that are scheduled to wrap up with closing arguments on Nov. 17 in Alexandria, Virginia.",

      "FVS was first used when South Korea coach Lee Chang-Won used a card for the first time during the opening match against Ukraine. He challenged a penalty, but the request was ultimately ruled out by the referee.",

      "Mexico's use of the system helped it overturn a penalty decision in a match they ended up tying 2-2 against Spain. It also led to Paraguay winger Enso Gonz\u00e1lez being red-carded after kicking South Korea striker Hyeon-oh Kim.",
      "Unlike VAR, which uses special cameras and a supporting team of officials, FVS referees review their decisions based on images captured by the television broadcast, without further assistance.",

      "Days later, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia\u2019s airspace.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\u201cIt's not really very unusual,\u201d said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment if clear skies permit. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven\u2019t observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\u201cIf you go out and just look at the moon when it\u2019s very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\u201d Pitts said.",

      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, said the H-1B program is a critical pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. It drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S., and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields, the lawsuit said.",

      "Messages seeking comment from the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which are named as defendants along with Trump and the State Department, were not immediately returned.",
      "The H-1B visa program was created by Congress to attract high-skilled workers to fill jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill. About a third of H-1B workers are nurses, teachers, physicians, scholars, priests and pastors, according to the lawsuit.",

      "Minnesota regulators have approved the takeover of Minnesota Power by an investment group, despite opposition from the state attorney general and consumer advocates",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group's takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates.",
      "In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers.",
      "The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence.",
      "Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power\u2019s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility's owner.",
      "Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S.",
      "Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power\u2019s operations, strategy and values wouldn\u2019t change under BlackRock and that the deal\u2019s cost wouldn't affect electric rates.",
      "Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock.",
      "The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department's attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest.",

      "Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with \u201ca high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,\u201d and \u201cassumed the absolute worst in these investors.\u201d But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest.",
      "Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval.",
      "\u201cPrivate equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans,\" Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement.

      "Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology\u2019s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet\u2019s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology's volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet's early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania.",
      "And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.",
      "Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world's most valuable company \u2014 worth $550 billion in March 2000 \u2014 before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco's stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career.",
      "Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley's most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company's stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago.",
      "While remaining Cisco's chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI's transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s?",
      "A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters.",
      "In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren\u2019t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?",
      "Q: Do you think AI is going to eliminate a lot of jobs?",
      "A: It happened with the internet. The problem this time is that if I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them. Will we be able to replace them over time? Yes, but there is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people.",

      "A: It\u2019s the most uncertain time on a global basis, ever. I would argue that this is the new normal. With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don\u2019t know how to do, especially with AI.",
      "Q: What\u2019s your view of how Big Tech has been working with President Donald Trump during his second term in office?",
      "A: Let\u2019s be realistic. Silicon Valley moved right, there shouldn\u2019t be any doubt. They did it for economic reasons. And practicality, they did it for their shareholders but also regulation was getting out of control. They weren\u2019t able to grow and China was plainly beating us.",
      "Q: How worried are you about China?",
      "A: I think China has full intention to win at the U.S.\u2019s expense. In China, there are no rules, there is no intellectual property, there are no issues about misusing the power. They intend to blow past militarily, economically, and in every other way. I do not view them as a partner, I view them as a serious competitor on all fronts and someone I don\u2019t trust. I think over time people are going to recognize it\u2019s in the U.S.\u2019s best interest and it\u2019s in China\u2019s best interest for us to get along. So go out 10 years, and that\u2019s the most likely outcome. But I think the next five years are going to be really bumpy and dangerous. We should have no illusions that they intend to crush us.",

    "story": [
      "In the wake of Jane Goodall's death, the many scientists and others influenced by her are promising to do their best to carry on her legacy",
      "In her 91 years, Jane Goodall transformed science and humanity's understanding of our closest living relatives on the planet \u2014 chimpanzees and other great apes. Her patient fieldwork and tireless advocacy for conservation inspired generations of future researchers and activists, especially women and young people, around the world.",
      "Her death on Wednesday set off a torrent of tributes for the famed primate researcher, with many people sharing stories of how Goodall and her work inspired their own careers. The tributes also included pledges to honor Goodall\u2019s memory by redoubling efforts to safeguard a planet that sorely needs it.",
      "\u201cJane Goodall is an icon \u2013 because she was the start of so much,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France.",
      "She recalled how many years ago Goodall answered a letter from a young aspiring researcher. \u201cI wrote her a letter asking how to become a primatologist. She sent back a handwritten letter and told me it will be hard, but I should try,\u201d Crockford said. \u201cFor me, she gave me my career.\u201d",
      "Goodall was one of three pioneering young women studying great apes in the 1960s and 1970s who began to revolutionize the way people understood just what was -- and wasn\u2019t -- unique about our own species. Sometimes called the \u201cTri-mates,\u201d Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas spent years documenting the intimate lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania, mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and orangutans in Indonesia, respectively.",
      "The projects they began have produced some of the longest-running studies about animal behavior in the world that are crucial to understanding such long-lived species. \u201cThese animals are like us, slow to mature and reproduce, and living for decades. We are still learning new things about them,\u201d said Tara Stoinski, a primatologist and president of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. \u201cJane and Dian knew each other and learned from each other, and the scientists who continued their work continue to collaborate today.\u201d",
      "Goodall studied chimpanzees \u2014 as a species and as individuals. And she named them: David Greybeard, Flo, Fifi, Goliath. That was highly unconventional at the time, but Goodall\u2019s attention to individuals created space for scientists to observe and record differences in individual behaviors, preferences and even emotions.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at St. Andrews University who was inspired by Goodall, recalled how Goodall carefully combined empathy and objectivity. Goodall liked to use a particular phrase, \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as happy,\u201d or \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as friends \u2013- these two individuals together,\u201d Hobaiter said. Goodall didn\u2019t project precise feelings onto the chimpanzees, but nor did she deny the capacity of animals besides humans to have emotional lives.",
      "Goodall and her frequent collaborator, evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff, had just finished the text of a forthcoming children's book, called \u201cEvery Elephant Has a Name,\u201d which will be published around early 2027.",
      "From the late 1980s until her death, Goodall spent less time in the field and more time on the road talking to students, teachers, diplomats, park rangers, presidents and many others around the world. She inspired countless others through her books. Her mission was to inspire action to protect the natural world.",
      "In 1991, she founded an organization called Roots & Shoots that grew to include chapters of young people in dozens of countries.",
      "Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist and founder of the nonprofit Saving Nature, recalled when he and Goodall were invited to speak to a congressional hearing about deforestation and extinction. Down the marble halls of the government building, \u201cthere was a huge line of teenage girls and their mothers just waiting to get inside the room to hear Jane speak,\u201d Pimm said Thursday. \u201cShe was mobbed everywhere she went -- she was just this incredible inspiration to people in general, particularly to young women.\u201d",
      "Goodall wanted everyone to find their voice, no matter their age or station, said Zanagee Artis, co-founder of the youth climate movement Zero Hour. \u201cI really appreciated how much Jane valued young people being in the room -- she really fostered intergenerational movement building,\u201d said Artis, who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",

      "What is left now that Goodall is gone is her unending hope, perhaps her greatest legacy.",

      "Goodall\u2019s legacy and life\u2019s work will continue through her family, scientists, her institute and legions of young people around the globe who are working to bridge conservation and humanitarian needs in their own communities, her longtime assistant said Thursday.",
      "That includes Goodall\u2019s son and three grandchildren, who are an important part of the work of the Jane Goodall Institute and in their own endeavors, said Mary Lewis, a vice president at the institute who began working with the famed primatologist in 1990.",
      "Goodall\u2019s son, Hugo van Lawick, works on sustainable housing. He is currently in Rwanda. Grandson Merlin and granddaughter Angelo work with the institute, while grandson Nick is a photographer and filmmaker, Lewis said. \u201cShe has her own family legacy as well as the legacy through her institutes around the world,\u201d said Lewis.",
      "In addition to her famed research center in Tanzania and chimpanzee sanctuaries in other countries, including the Republic of Congo and South Africa, a new cultural center is expected to open in Tanzania late next year. There also are Jane Goodall Institutes in 26 countries, and communities are leading conservation projects in several countries, including an effort in Senegal to save critically endangered Western chimpanzees.",
      "But it is the institute\u2019s youth-led education program called Roots & Shoots that Goodall regarded as her enduring legacy because it is \u201cempowering new generations,\u201d Lewis said.",

In this vineyard about a 90-minute drive east of Lisbon, the cool autumn night carries the smell of ripe fruit. The workers' laughter blends with the sound of rustling leaves.",
      "The night harvest is a time-honored practice in viticulture, meant to preserve the freshness of grapes and shield them from the adverse effects of daytime heat, sunlight and oxidation. As summers in Portugal grow longer, hotter and more unpredictable \u2014 in part due to climate change \u2014 the practice has become more common here.",
      "B\u00e1rbara Monteiro, co-owner and manager of the Herdade Da Fonte Santa vineyard said she struggled at first to convince her harvesters to work at night \u2014 midnight to 8 a.m. They began doing so in 2019.",

Warmer weather can make them reach sugar maturity before developing a full flavor and ripeness, leading to higher alcohol levels but less complex wines.

      "All five fires forced everyone aboard to evacuate \u2014 in one case, as many as 350 passengers \u2014 with a few minor injuries reported. One railcar was involved in two of the fires, and two other railcars were destroyed, the NTSB said.",

      "The creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone line used to connect your computer online \u2014 along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials.",

      "The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June \u2014 the second-warmest June on record \u2014 which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists have uncovered new types of organics in icy geysers spouting from Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, bolstering the likelihood that the ocean world may harbor conditions suitable for life.",
      "Their findings, reported Wednesday, are based on observations made by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft in 2008 during a close and fast flyby of Enceladus. The small moon, one of 274 orbiting Saturn, has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.",
      "While Enceladus may be habitable, no one is suggesting that life exists.",
      "\u201cBeing habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" said the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study.",
      "An international team decided to launch a fresh analysis of tiny grains of ice encountered as Cassini flew through the moon's geysers. The grains were young compared with the much older geyser particles that ended up in one of Saturn\u2019s outermost rings.",
      "These new grains collided with Cassini\u2019s cosmic dust analyzer at 40,000 mph (64,800 kph), faster than the old ones. The increased speed provided a clearer view of the chemical compounds present, the scientists noted.",
      "Organic molecules already had been spotted in the old geyser grains, but their age raised questions as to whether they had been altered over the years by space radiation.",
      "Scientists found some of the same molecules in the fresh grains, confirming they came from the moon\u2019s underground sea, as well as new chemical compounds. The findings were published in Nature Astronomy.",
      "An ice-encapsulated water world barely 310 miles (500 kilometers) across with a rocky core, Enceladus is suspected of having hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor, quite possibly like those in the Arctic. The moon's jets of water vapor and frozen particles can stretch thousands of miles (kilometers) into space.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that these molecules originate from the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, enhancing its habitability potential,\" the Free University of Berlin\u2019s Nozair Khawaja, the lead author, said in an email.",

      "\"Let me be clear, Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation's cities,\" Pritzker said during a news conference.",

      "Miller added, \"The clearest example of this is when you have ICE officers, who are carrying out the statutes and the laws of the United States to arrest and remove illegal aliens, who are being subjected to violent attacks in the conduct of their duties. That's an example of illegitimate violence, illegitimate power in the form of domestic terrorism being used to impede the conduct of their official duties.\"",
      "In its lawsuit filed on Monday morning, the state of Illinois and the City of Chicago asked a judge to block the Trump administration's deployment of military troops to Chicago.",

      "\"We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents' constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority. ICE agents are detaining elected officials, tear-gassing protestors, children, and Chicago police officers, and abusing Chicago residents,\" Johnson said. \"We will not stand for that in our city.\"",
      "Miller said Johnson's executive order is the latest example of Democrat politicians refusing the condemn the attacks on federal agents.",
      "\"The mayor of Chicago has not only failed to condemn the violent, obstructive acts against ICE and law enforcement, but in the aftermath of two coordinated attempted murders of ICE officers through vehicle ramming attacks, he issued a no go zone for ICE officers,\" Miller said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments in its latest LGBTQ+ rights case Tuesday, weighing the constitutionality of bans passed by nearly half of U.S. states on the practice known as conversion therapy for children.",
      "The justices are hearing a lawsuit from a Christian counselor challenging a Colorado law that prohibits therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation or gender identity. Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",
      "Colorado, on the other hand, says the measure simply regulates licensed therapists by barring a practice that's been scientifically discredited and linked to serious harm.",
      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",
      "Colorado has not sanctioned anyone under the 2019 law, which exempts religious ministries. State attorneys say it still allows any therapist to have wide-ranging, faith-based conversations with young patients about gender and sexuality.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\u201d Colorado state attorneys wrote.",
      "Therapy isn't just speech, they said \u2014 it's health care that governments have a responsibility to regulate. Violating the law carries potential fines of $5,000 and license suspension or even revocation.",
      "Linda Robertson is a Christian mom of four from Washington state whose son Ryan underwent therapy that promised to change his sexual orientation after he came out to her at age 12. The techniques led him to blame himself when it didn\u2019t work, leaving him ashamed and depressed. He died in 2009, after multiple suicide attempts and a drug overdose at age 20.",
      "\u201cWhat happened in conversion therapy, it devastated Ryan\u2019s bond with me and my husband,\" she said. \u201cAnd it absolutely destroyed his confidence he could ever be loved or accepted by God.\u201d",
      "Chiles contends her approach is different from the kind of conversion therapy once associated with practices like shock therapy decades ago. She said she believes \u201cpeople flourish when they live consistently with God\u2019s design, including their biological sex,\" and she argues evidence of harm from her approach is lacking.",
      "Chiles says Colorado is discriminating because it allows counselors to affirm minors coming out as gay or identifying as transgender but bans counseling like hers for young patients who may want to change their behavior or feelings. \u201cWe're not saying this counseling should be mandatory, but if someone wants the counseling they should be able to get it,\u201d said one of her attorneys, Jonathan Scruggs.",

The group also represented a Christian website designer who doesn\u2019t want to work with same-sex couples and successfully challenged a Colorado anti-discrimination law in 2023.",
      "The group's argument in the conversion therapy case also builds on another victory from 2018: A Supreme Court decision found California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion. Chiles should also be free from that kind of state regulation, the group argued.",
      "Still, the Supreme Court has also found that regulations that only \u201cincidentally\u201d burden speech are permissible, and the state argues that striking down its law against conversion therapy would undercut states' ability to regulate discredited health care of all kids.",
      "The high court agreed to hear the case after the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the law. Another appeals court, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, has struck down similar bans in Florida.",

      "The Upper Midwest has some of the largest concentrations of Scandinavian Americans in the U.S., and his tour takes him Tuesday to Minnesota, where well over 800,000 residents claim Norwegian ancestry, according to state demographers. That's more than any other state, though less-populous North Dakota actually has a higher percentage of residents with Norwegian roots. Members of the royal family have made several visits to the region over the years.",
      "Haakon's visit is part of the Crossings 200 commemorations across North America this year.",
      "Nearly 5 million North Americans now claim Norwegian ancestry. The U.S. was a relatively welcoming place for Scandinavians during the main waves of emigration that began in the 1800s. They were drawn to the Upper Midwest by cheap land and jobs.",
      "But much has changed since then, and today immigration is a contentious issue for both the U.S. and Scandinavian and other European countries.",
      "Haakon went Monday to Vesterheim, a museum in Decorah, Iowa, that tells the story of Norwegian immigrants in America. He met there with three descendants of people who arrived on the Restauration, a ship carrying 52 Norwegians that left July 4, 1825, from Stavanger. One of the travelers gave birth on the long voyage, so 53 arrived in New York. More than 800,000 other Norwegians eventually followed.",
      "The crown prince also visited Luther College in Decorah, a school founded by Norwegian immigrants in 1861, which presented him with an honorary degree.",
      "\u201cI will carry it as a symbol of the close friendship between the United States and Norway,\" Haakon told students and faculty. \"Thank you for keeping alive the stories that bind us together across oceans, across generations, across time.\u201d",
      "According to the school, it was the ninth visit to Decorah by members of the royal family since 1939. The most recent previous visit to town was by his parents, King Harald V, who is Europe's oldest monarch, and Queen Sonja, in 2011.",

      "River otters, manatees, seat turtles, penguins and sharks are among the marine animals getting a new home in Florida",
      "Crews used large nets, water-filled containers and box trucks to relocate hundreds of river otters, sea turtles, manatees, penguins and sharks to their new home: Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium.",
      "Over the past couple of months, the marine animals were removed from the hard-to-reach island and relocated to a brand new center, where Mote believes they will be able to live in more authentic habitats and make it easier for the public to learn about marine sciences. The Mote Science Education Aquarium, just east of Sarasota, is set to open to the public on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe have created new authentic habitats for all our species of marine life, including a massive manatee habitat, and homes for some of our newest animals, like the giant Pacific octopus and our penguins,\" said Kevin Cooper, vice president for communications and strategic Initiatives at Mote.",
      "\u201cWe are also adding more opportunities to learn about marine science for our guests, school children and adult learners and offering new opportunities for citizen scientists to participate in marine science through outreach,\u201d he said.",
      "It was increasingly challenging for visitors to make their way across the bridges from the mainland to the facility on Sarasota's City Island where it had been for 45 years. So it made sense to move the aquarium and education centers farther east while keeping the research portion of the facility on the barrier island.",
      "In July, Mote closed to the public to prepare so the transition could begin. And in August, crews started moving the animals to the new facility.",
      "Mote educated upwards of 350,000 guests each year and it's expected to double that in the new center, Cooper said. It cost $130 million to build.",
      "It took time to make sure the habitats at the new Mote SEA facility had the appropriate water chemistry and microbial communities before the animals arrived.",
      "\u201cIn the process of that relocation, each different species requires a different type of relocation techniques in order to move them from one facility to another,\" said Evan Barniskis, associate vice president for Mote. \u201cWhen moving sharks and fish, you have to do so in water with plenty of oxygen and filtration on it.\u201d",
      "They moved many of the fish and sharks at night, when there was less traffic. The manatees required air-conditioned box trucks that are specifically designed for manatee relocations. Mote has a team devoted to picking up stranded manatees and to rehabilitate them.",
      "\u201cThe otters are a little bit simpler because they have specially designed cages that are kind of similar to those you would put a dog or a cat in,\u201d Barniskis said. He added that they moved them in air-conditioned vehicles.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The United States under the Biden and Trump administrations has provided at least $21.7 billion in military assistance to Israel since the start of the Gaza war two years ago, according to a new academic study published Tuesday, the second anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel that provoked the conflict.",
      "Another study, also published by the Costs of War project at Brown University\u2019s Watson School of International and Public Affairs, says the U.S. has spent roughly $10 billion more on security aid and operations in the broader Middle East in the past two years.",
      "While the reports rely on open source material for most of their findings, they offer some of the most comprehensive accountings of U.S. military aid to close ally Israel and estimated costs of direct American military involvement in the Middle East.",
      "The State Department had no immediate comment about the amount of military aid provided to Israel since October 2023. The White House referred questions to the Pentagon, which oversees only a portion of the assistance.",
      "The reports, which draw on publicly available notifications to Congress, were released as President Donald Trump presses for an end to the war in Gaza. Israeli and Hamas officials launched indirect talks in Egypt this week after Hamas accepted some elements of the U.S. plan that Israel also said it supported.",
      "The reports, which are sharply critical of Israel, say that without the U.S. assistance, Israel would not have been able to sustain its concerted campaign against Hamas in Gaza. They note that tens of billions of dollars in future funding for Israel is projected under various bilateral agreements.",

(AP) \u2014 The Democratic and Republican ballots aren't short on candidates in Tuesday's Tennessee primary special election to replace a GOP congressman who stepped aside this summer, including one who landed President Donald Trump's endorsement last week.",
      "The race to replace former U.S. Rep. Mark Green centers on one of three districts that GOP lawmakers drew as safely red in 2022 by dividing left-leaning Nashville. The Dec. 2 general election could gauge the popularity of Trump\u2019s aggressive second-term agenda, especially with suburban Republican voters.",
      "The 7th Congressional District spans 14 counties, bordering both Kentucky and Alabama. Its voters elected Green by 21 percentage points in 2024 and by nearly 22 points in 2022. Along with parts of Nashville, it includes rural areas, wealthy suburbs and part of the Fort Campbell military installation.",
      "With 11 Republicans on the ballot, Matt Van Epps turned heads when Trump backed him on Friday, the day after in-person early voting had ended. The endorsement prompted another high-profile candidate, state Rep. Lee Reeves, to announce he was suspending his campaign and backing Van Epps, a former general services commissioner in the administration of GOP Gov. Bill Lee. The governor and Green had already endorsed Van Epps. Trump lauded Van Epps for his military service.",
      "It's too late to remove Reeves' name from the ballot.",
      "The field includes two other Republican state representatives, Gino Bulso and Jody Barrett. Bulso is a Brentwood attorney who has been an outspoken advocate for socially conservative policies, including those that target LGBTQ people's rights. Bulso has poured almost $700,000 of his own wealth into the race.",
      "Outside groups have spent more than $3.1 million, almost all on the GOP side, with upwards of $1.1 million opposing Barrett.",
      "School choice interests who have denounced Barrett's vote against Gov. Lee\u2019s statewide school voucher expansion are behind many of the attack ads against Barrett. Barrett, an attorney from Dickson, has said he pushed back against the \u201celites\u201d in his own party, and has praised a school choice tax credit initiative touted by Trump. He has the House Freedom Fund's backing.",
      "Those three have drawn the most attention, but they aren't the only well-funded GOP candidates. Mason Foley, a health care businessman and former staffer for Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, loaned his campaign $325,000. And Stewart Parks, who was pardoned by Trump after entering the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, contributed roughly $300,000 to his campaign through contributions and loans.",

      "Nelson led the faith up until his death in late September at the age of 101.",

About 600 members of Nelson's family are expected to attend along with 20,000 people who quickly snapped up tickets that the church offered online within 20 minutes, said church spokesperson Doug Andersen.",
      "The service also will be broadcast globally on the church's website and other online platforms.",
      "Nelson\u2019s funeral will be devoid of formal church rituals, Andersen said. It will resemble a worship service with prayers, hymns and talks and will focus on Nelson's life and purpose, he said.",
      "Both aspects of Nelson\u2019s legacy \u2014 as a spiritual leader for four decades and as a heart surgeon who saved lives \u2014 will be celebrated during the service, Andersen said.",
      "Nelson\u2019s body will be dressed in mostly white temple clothing, the ceremonial garments worn by adult members. The commemoration service, open to Latter-day Saints and non-members, will be conducted by a lay minister. A public viewing was held Monday at the conference center, attended by about 18,560 people, according to Andersen.",
      "He said church funerals typically are \u201cmarked by an atmosphere of hopefulness and peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey generally are not burdened by the inconsolable grief and despair so often seen in other funerals,\" he said. \u201cThat is especially true in this case with a life lived beyond 101 years.\u201d",
      "Nelson\u2019s funeral will also feature \u201cheartfelt tributes and comforting music\u201d performed by the famed Tabernacle Choir, said Andersen.",
      "It will include a hymn written by Nelson titled \u201cOur Prayer to Thee,\u201d which was first published in the church\u2019s official publication and performed at general conferences in October 2018 and April 2022. One musician described the song as a special, sacred representation of the relationship between God and the faithful.",
      "Nelson's family members likely will select the other songs and hymns that will be performed at the funeral.",
      "While the funeral will be public, the burial will be private with family. It will take place at Pioneer Cemetery, where Brigham Young and many other pioneers of the faith are buried, Andersen said.",
      "Family plays a significant role in the faith, not just in this life, but also in the afterlife, said Kathleen Flake, former professor of Mormon Studies at the University of Virginia.",

      "The records enabled investigators to see basic information about the date and time of the calls but not the content of the communications, the senators said. The data encompassed several days during the week of Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to halt the certification of the election results.",
      "The disclosure adds new detail to the since-shuttered investigation by the FBI and former special counsel Jack Smith into the steps Trump and allies took in the run-up to the Capitol riot to undo his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump was indicted in August 2023 on charges of conspiring to overturn the results, but the case was abandoned after Trump\u2019s win the following year in light of a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.",

      "That document was dated Sept. 27, 2023, and lists the following Republican lawmakers as people whose records were apparently scrutinized: Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Sen.

Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's plan to deploy the military on U.S. soil is sparking conflict with blue state governors that is playing out in the courts",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's latest bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition is triggering a new conflict with blue state governors that is playing out in the courts as Trump envisages a country where armed soldiers patrol U.S. streets.",
      "Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.",
      "His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers \u2014 setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump\u2019s aggressive use of the National Guard.",
      "At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an \u201cinvasion from within.\u201d To his critics, however, Trump's use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.",
      "\u201cWhat will happen when the president loses in court?\u201d said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. \u201cWill he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?\u201d",
      "Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump\u2019s attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.",
      "Control over a state's National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized \u2014 as they were in California over the governor's objections. Otherwise, it's up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.",
      "Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He's called Portland \u201cwar ravaged\" and a \u201cwar zone\u201d that is \u201cburning down\u201d and like \u201cliving in hell.\u201d",
      "However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military\u2019s role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America\u2019s long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.",
      "Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.",
      "\u201cIf I had to enact it \u2014 I\u2019d do that,\" Trump said. \"If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have to make sure our cities are safe.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America's cities safer.",
      "\u2033You guys are framing this like, \u2018The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,\u2019\" Leavitt told reporters Monday. \u201cThe president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.",
      "While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it\u2019s typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.",
      "One result is that governors like California's Gavin Newsom and Illinois' JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.",

      "Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Instead, they will look at whether Trump\u2019s orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.",

      "Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.",

      "Meteorologists say a deadly tornado in North Dakota this summer has been upgraded to a top-of-the-scale EF5, and was the first on American soil in 12 years",
      "A deadly tornado that tore across southeastern North Dakota this summer has been upgraded to an EF5 with winds topping 200 mph (322 kph), the strongest classification of tornado and the first confirmed on American soil in a dozen years, meteorologists said Monday.",
      "The June 20 twister near the town of Enderlin killed three people and at its largest was 1.05 miles wide (1.7 kilometers), carving a path across the prairie for just over 12 miles (19 kilometers). Meteorologists from the National Weather Service office in Grand Forks estimated the tornado's winds reached 210 mph (338 kph), according to the newly released analysis.",
      "The 1999 Bridge Creek-Moore tornado in Oklahoma holds the record of the strongest winds ever recorded in the U.S. at 321 mph (517 kph).",
      "Since the National Weather Service began using Enhanced Fujita scale in 2007, there have been 10 tornadoes categorized as EF5. The 12-year gap between top-of-the-scale ratings is the longest since the agency started keeping records in 1950. The earlier tornadoes were assessed using an older version of the EF scale called the Fujita scale.",
      "\u201cIn the last kind of 12 years, there\u2019s been several strong tornadoes that have come close, but there haven\u2019t been known damage indicators at that time to support the EF5 rating,\u201d said Melinda Beerends, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service in Grand Forks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes to get tornadoes to hit something,\u201d she said.",
      "The morning after the EF5 tornado, meteorologists from the Grand Forks office headed into the field to assess the damage. They studied how the twister had uprooted trees, tipped over fully loaded rail cars, toppled transmission towers and destroyed farmsteads, including one that had its foundation swept clean with just the basement remaining.",
      "\u201cThe city of Enderlin, other than losing power, pretty much went unscathed,\u201d said Mayor Deon Maasjo. Two men and a woman were killed at two locations east of the town, which is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Fargo.",

      "Determining a tornado's strength usually takes days or weeks, as meteorologists study the damage to buildings and trees. This case took much longer because of the unusual damage to rail cars, including one that was picked up and hurled far from the rest. The meteorologists worked with engineers and wind damage experts to conduct additional surveys and forensic analysis to determine the EF5 rating, up from the initial estimate of EF3.",
      "The tornado was caused by warm, moist air in a place that's ripe for a thunderstorm, Beerends said. But there was also a high amount of wind shear, which is a variation of wind speed and direction that created the conditions for the tornado.",
      "In recent years, tornadoes have been occurring with greater frequency east of the Mississippi River, said Victor Gensini, professor of atmospheric sciences at Northern Illinois University.",
      "\u201cIf you look 40 to 50 years ago, the tornadoes that were happening in places like Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas are kind of happening there with less frequency, and we\u2019re seeing more tornadoes in places like Birmingham, Little Rock and Memphis,\u201d he said.",
      "Though meteorologists aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s causing the trend, the higher frequency of tornadoes in the Mid-South and Midwest is notable because it\u2019s closer to population centers, Gensini said, so there\u2019s a greater chance a tornado may hit something.",
      "The last recorded EF5 tornado was on May 20, 2013, in a town outside Oklahoma City, killing 24 people and injuring more than 200 others. That tornado tore through hundreds of homes, a school, hospital and bowling alley in Moore, where nearly a decade later, droves of moviegoers lined up to watch the 2024 film \u201cTwisters.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis was certainly not an easy year for any of us,\u201d Grandi told the opening of UNHCR\u2019s executive committee. \u201cBut remember, please: There has never been an easy year to be a refugee \u2014 and there never will be.\u201d",

      "Other traditional donors have cut back their aid outlays for UNHCR this year.",
      "In recent years, the agency has received roughly $5 billion a year \u2014 or half its budgetary requirements \u2014 even as conflict and repression in places like Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sudan, Venezuela and Ukraine have led the number of people fleeing their homes to roughly double over the last decade \u2014 to 122 million.",
      "In the politically charged environment of today, Grandi said, \u201cputting the (U.N.) Refugee Convention and the principle of asylum on the table would be a catastrophic error.\u201d He insisted that \u201cnational sovereignty and the right to seek asylum \u201dare not incompatible. They are complementary.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump claims his policies have generated $17 trillion in new investments, but the real number is likely much less",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The economic boom promised by President Donald Trump centers on a single number: $17 trillion.",
      "That's the sum of new investments that Trump claims to have generated with his tariffs, income tax cuts and aggressive salesmanship of CEOs, financiers, tech titans, prime ministers, presidents and other rulers. The $17 trillion is supposed to fund new factories, new technologies, more jobs, higher incomes and faster economic growth.",
      "\u201cUnder eight months of Trump, we\u2019ve already secured commitments of $17 trillion coming in,\u201d the president said in a speech last month. \u201cThere\u2019s never been any country that\u2019s done anything like that.\u201d",
      "But based on statements from various companies, foreign countries and the White House's own website, that figure appears to be exaggerated, highly speculative and far higher than the actual sum. The White House website lists total investments at $8.8 trillion, though that figure appears to be padded with some investment commitments made during Joe Biden's presidency.",
      "The White House didn't lay out the math after multiple requests as to how Trump calculated $17 trillion in investment commitments. But the issue goes beyond Trump's hyperbolic talk to his belief that the brute force of tariffs and shaming of companies can deliver economic results, a strategy that could go sideways for him politically if the tough talk fails to translate into more jobs and higher incomes.",
      "Just 37% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a September poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. That's down from a peak of 56% in early 2020 during Trump's first term \u2014 a memory he relied upon when courting voters in last year's election.",
      "Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said the public commitments announced by Trump do represent a \u201cmeaningful increase\u201d \u2014 but one that amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars, not trillions. Even then, that comes with long-term costs as countries might be less inclined to invest with the U.S. after being threatened to do so.",
      "\u201cIt is a national security mistake because you\u2019re turning allies into colonies of a sort \u2014 you\u2019re forcibly extracting from them things that they don\u2019t see as entirely in their interest,\u201d Posen said. \u201cTwisting the arms of governments to then twist the arms of their own businesses is not going to get you the payoff you want.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration is betting that tariffs are an effective tool to prod other countries and international companies to invest in the United States, a big stick that other administrations failed to wield. Trump's pitch to voters is that he will play a role in directly managing the investment commitments made by foreign countries \u2014 and that the allocation of that money starting next year will revive what has been a flagging job market.",
      "\u201cThe difference between hypothetical investments and ground being broken on new factories and facilities is good leadership and sound policy,\" said White House spokesman Kush Desai.",
      "The White House said that Japan will invest $1 trillion, largely at Trump's direction. The European Union will commit $600 billion. The United Arab Emirates made commitments of $1.4 trillion over 10 years. Qatar pledged $1.2 trillion. Saudi Arabia intends to pony up $600 billion, India $500 billion and South Korea $450 billion, among others.",
      "The challenge is the precise terms of those investments have yet to be fully codified and released to the public, and some numbers are under dispute, potentially fuzzy math or, in the case of Qatar, more than five times the annual gross domestic product of the entire country. The White House maintains that Qatar is good for the money because it produces oil.",

      "\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, these commitments are worth about as much as the paper they\u2019re not written down on,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, who was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Biden White House.",

      "So far, there has yet to be a notable boost in business investment as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product. As a share of the overall economy, business investment during the first six months of Trump's presidency has been consistently bouncing around 14%, just as it was before the pandemic.",
      "But economists also note that Trump is double-counting and relying on investments that were initially announced during the Biden administration or investments that were already likely to occur because of the artificial intelligence build out.",
      "For example, the White House lists a $16 billion investment by computer chipmaker Global Foundries. But of that sum, more than $13 billion was announced during the Biden administration and supported by $1.6 billion in grants by the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, as well as other state and federal incentives.",

      "Experts say a food aid program that helps 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money unless the government shutdown ends within two weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money within two weeks unless the government shutdown ends, forcing states to use their own money to keep it afloat or risk it shutting down, experts say.",
      "The $8 billion Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples that are often out of financial reach for low-income households.",
      "The shutdown, which began Wednesday, coincided with the beginning of a new fiscal year, meaning programs like WIC, which rely on annual infusions from the federal government, are nearly out of money. Currently, the program is being kept afloat by an $150 million contingency fund, but experts say it could run dry quickly.",
      "After that, states could step in to pay for the program and seek reimbursement when a budget finally passes, but not all states say they can afford to do so.",
      "\u201cWe feel good about one to two weeks,\u201d said Ali Hard, policy director for the National WIC Association. \u201cAfter that, we are very worried.\u201d",
      "Taylor Moyer, a mother of three who recently separated from her husband, has been receiving WIC since her first son was born nine years ago. She said the program allowed her to feed her children nutritious food that tends to be pricier than calorie-dense, processed options. It also provided guidance when she struggled to breastfeed and counseled her on how to handle her son's picky eating stage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times where I have sat back in my house and really wondered how I was going to feed my family,\u201d said Moyer, who works at the LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cAnd I went to the store with my WIC card ... I get rice, I got avocados, I got eggs, and I made a balanced meal that was actually good.\u201d",
      "The shutdown came as Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a new spending plan. Democratic lawmakers want to extend tax credits that make health care cheaper for millions of Americans, and they want to reverse deep cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year. They refused to sign on to any spending plan that did not include those provisions.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed Democrats for the shutdown and called them hypocritical because failing to fund the federal government endangers so many health programs.",
      "The WIC program, which has long had bipartisan support, aids those who are pregnant, mothers and children under age 5. Research has tied it to lower infant mortality, healthier birth weights, higher immunization rates and better academic outcomes for children who participate. Nearly half of those who are eligible don't enroll, often because they believe they don't qualify or they can't reach a WIC office.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers want to cut WIC, which is targeted for elimination in Project 2025, the influential policy blueprint authored by the man who's now President Donald Trump\u2019s budget chief. Trump\u2019s budget request and the spending plan backed by House Republicans would not fully fund the program. They also want to cut funding for families to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.",

      "An Associated Press tally shows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on TV recruitment ads targeting officers frustrated by local restrictions on immigration enforcement",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on television advertising in select metro areas around the country, an Associated Press tally found, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities' restrictions on immigration enforcement into President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.",
      "\u201cYou took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,\u201d the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. \u201cBut in sanctuary cities, you\u2019re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.\u201d",
      "The campaign \u2014 airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta \u2014 is part of ICE\u2019s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations. The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump\u2019s Republican administration for ICE \u2014 a 10-fold increase in its current budget \u2014 as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.",
      "ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.",
      "And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as the result of Congress\u2019 failure to pass a spending measure last week, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, the Trump administration\u2019s top priority, is still flush with cash.",
      "The ads open with video of each metro\u2019s familiar skyline and the narrator\u2019s voice announcing, for example, \u201cAttention, Miami law enforcement.\u201d Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to \u201cjoin ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,\" according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.",
      "The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. Adding to the list a week ago: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.",
      "As of Friday, total spending on the ads had topped $5.7 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in the past week, $794,084, according to AdImpact.",
      "It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that \u201cthat impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.\u201d",
      "Asked in an AP email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a Sept. 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.",
      "Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.",
      "Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city's mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration's immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement \u201cunless legally required.\u201d",

      "Philadelphia police Capt. John Walker said it's too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city's recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.",

And so, the artist, to try and explain himself, has got to work a bit harder.\"",

      "I asked, \"Do you get something out of playing on stage that you don't, playing alone?\"",
      "\"I get scared,\" he replied. \"A lot of human beings out there!\"",
      "But this musical giant who got his start in the 1960s, and is now in his late 70s, can still move a crowd.",
      "Nicole Perry Ellis came to London's Hyde Park with her daughter Natasha to attend a Yusuf concert. She described it as a \"very emotional moment. Because before [Natasha] was born, we used to listen to the music when I was pregnant.\"",

      "\"I think my songs have always been kind of profound in some way,\" Yusuf said. \"A lot of them are so relevant to the world today. I mean, 'Wild World'? You know, come on! And 'Peace Train,' waiting for the train to arrive. Boy, do we need it, yeah. I mean they're relevant.\"",
      "His core themes have endured, as his name has gone through its evolutions. \"I had a girlfriend who looked at me one day and said, 'Ooh, you look like a cat.' And I went, 'What?' That stuck. And then I was looking for a name, because it was going to be difficult to go into the record store and ask for, like, Stephen Demetre Georgiou's latest album.\"",

      "He writes that reaching superstardom in his teens was quite difficult. \"The problem with success is that it kind of detaches you from reality in some sense,\" he said. \"Who are you? Are you that person on the screen, on the stage, or is there something more to you? I was looking for some big answers.\"",
      "I asked, \"What all did you try, spiritually?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, the bookshop is full of lots of different views of life and beliefs and philosophies, so I was digging around everywhere. I think the most important thing was when I finally reached the Quran at the end. And that just brought everything together.\"",
      "He took the name Yusuf Islam, and \u2013 believing that music was haram, or forbidden \u2013 redirected his royalties to fund his charity efforts, auctioned off instruments, focused on family, and for nearly 30 years left music.",
      "Why did he believe music was forbidden? \"It took me time to realize that a lot of what I was told in the beginning when I became a Muslim was not exactly right,\" he said. \"You know, Islam doesn't forbid anything that's healthy and morally good.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you reconcile the you who put that aside, with the you who embraced music again?\"",
      "\"You go through stages,\" Yusuf said. \"At one time you can fall in love, and next time you're having such an argument with a person, you say, 'What the hell, get out of my life!' You know, you change, your attitude changes according to circumstance. Context is key.\"",
      "He provides context to a controversial chapter regarding Salman Rushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses,\" which inflamed the Muslim world \u2013 and the fatwa calling for the author's death. In 1989, in an appearance on a British TV program where hypothetical questions were posed, he was asked if he'd attend an effigy burning of Rushdie, to which he replied, \"I would have hoped that it would have been the real thing, but actually no, if it's just an effigy I don't think I would be that moved to go there.\"",
      "\"I mean, I've got a British sense of humor,\" Yusuf said. \"I took it in a kind of slightly comical direction. It wasn't a good thing to do, because nobody laughed. So, you know, I kind of, I made a mistake in thinking that people might get the joke. But it was a serious issue, so I shouldn't have really done that.\"",
      "\"The joke you mean, saying preferred the real thing, not the effigy?\"",
      "\"Whatever, whatever, whatever.\"",
      "\"When you saw the headlines after that, do you worry even today that \u2013 \"",
      "\"Let's get off this subject, please,\" Yusuf said.",
      "\"You bring it up in the book, so it seems \u2013 \"",
      "\"No, it was only a little part of the book.\"",
      "I said, \"But it seems like with this book you partially wanted to set the record straight from your perspective.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Yusuf replied. \"I think I've done that.\"",
      "I asked, \"How is it to sit down and write something so personal, to go through the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful?\"",
      "\"I left quite a lot of the ugly out, actually, to be honest!\"",
      "\"You were hard on yourself.\"",
      "\"Really? That's nice to know. I tried to be honest in my writing of songs, and in the writing of my book.\"",

So, joining these two names together actually forms the complete picture of, like, who I am. And you just have to listen to the songs. They're biographical in themselves. I didn't have to write a book, actually. You just buy the records, you know?\"",

    "summary": "The three-time Oscar-winning actor has been absent from movie screens for eight years, until a collaboration with his son, Ronan, brought him back for \"Anemone,\" the story of a man living in self-exile.",
    "story": [
      "He has been called the greatest actor of his generation \u2013 a three-time Oscar-winner, and reluctant star. \"The work itself has always been, has remained nothing but a source of fascination and pleasure to me, the work itself,\" said Daniel Day-Lewis. \"The aftermath of the work has always been difficult for me. You know, you become to some extent a sales rep for that work. And I'm not good at that. I never was. And I'm still not. And that particular part of it, the public part of it, has always left me feeling emptied out.\"",
      "And eight years ago, he announced his retirement. But now, a clarification: \"I think that was a mistake,\" he said. \"I think it just created a kind of confusion. At the time, I never intended to retire from anything. I chose to stop doing one kind of work so that I could perhaps concentrate on a different kind of work.\"",
      "It was part musical interlude: \"My youngest son, Cashel, is a fiddle player. And once the idea took root in my head, like, 'I wonder if I could make him a fiddle,' that was the \u2014 you know, things tend to, yeah, it's hard to let go of a thing.\"",
      "He made three, and he says he has the makings of a fourth, \"but I just haven't got down to it yet.\"",
      "Day-Lewis admits he was surprised to feel a strong impulse to return to acting: \"And largely it was in response to the knowledge that Ronan would be making films.\"",
      "Twenty-seven-year-old middle son Ronan Day-Lewis brings credentials and expectations: His mother, filmmaker and author Rebecca Miller, and grandfather, playwright Arthur Miller.",
      "I asked Ronan, \"Was your move to film a surprise to your parents?\"",
      "\"Not really, because I started making little movies with my friends when I was, like, seven,\" he replied. \"When I was really young, I would always be the one kind of annoyingly trying to corral everyone into making a little movie on our dad's, like, flip camera in the backyard or something.\"",
      "\"Anemone\" is his directorial debut, co-written with his father, who plays Ray Stoker. The story unfolds in a remote cabin. Ronan said, \"The first kind of concrete anchor, I think, was the idea of this man who's kind of in this form of self-exile, that he's living in the middle of nowhere. For some reason that pertains to his past, he's kind of separated himself and banished himself to this isolated place.\"",
      "After twenty years, his brother (played by Sean Bean) arrives to bring Ray Stoker back to the son he's never met. Daniel said, \"I felt I knew Ray fairly early on in the writing process. I don't know why I did. I just did. I can't explain it.\"",

      "Daniel Day-Lewis is legendary for his immersive preparation \u2013 as a fashion designer (\"Phantom Thread\"), in the boxing ring (\"The Boxer\"), in a wheelchair (\"My Left Foot\"). But after more than 20 film roles, one character remains elusive: Daniel Day-Lewis.",
      "I asked what drives him to such perfection.",
      "\"I've resisted analysis to a large extent because, maybe out of superstition, I thought it might interfere with the impulse, which was strong in me and still is,\" Daniel replied. \"But I mean, put on the spot I'd say it's got something to do with that period of time which was very bleak in my life when I was sent away to school.\"",
      "His mother, actress Jill Balcon, came from a prominent British film family. His father, Cecil Day-Lewis, who died when Daniel was 15, was well-known in literary circles \u2013 perhaps not so well-known at home.",
      "\"It's not that we never got to see him,\" said Daniel. \"He was a good man. But my only conversations that I remember having with him [was] when I was in trouble, which I was frequently for all kinds of different things. That's my memory of it. It may be a distorted memory.\"",
      "In 1968, his father was named poet laureate of the United Kingdom, and Daniel was sent to boarding school at 11. \"I felt like I was at sea,\" he said. \"I had no friends. I was being bullied. I was scrappy, but in that place you're considered to be, like, just outrageously uncivilized if you took a swipe at someone, which I did now and then.\"",
      "Despite pleading, he was left to tough it out: \"It was my father's decision. He believed I should stay there, and that I would feel a sense of defeat if I left. But I don't think, because he didn't really see me, he didn't understand the degree to which I was already defeated.\"",
      "And yet, boarding school is where he found his life's work. \"I did a few little bits and pieces in school plays,\" he said. \"And it wasn't the magic of the theater for me; it was the alternative world, where everything around me seemed fairly dark. That was a place that was illuminated for me.\"",
      "But stardom came with a darker side, as he was forewarned by the head of a prestigious summer theater program for teens 50 years ago. \"He launched into a kind of cautionary tale about the world of professional acting and the theater, about the sleaze and the corruption, and I was really quite na\u00efve at that time. But something about what he said that day stayed with me. I never wondered about the work, but I began to wonder about the world that I was going into. And so, I did reach a crossroads where I wondered whether perhaps I'd become a cabinet maker, a furniture maker, instead.\"",
      "He seems to have found a comfortable place at the crossroad in \"Anemone\":\u00a0 a reluctant father on film, and devoted father off-camera.",
      "\"Anemone\" is the culmination of a yearslong father-son collaboration.",
      "I asked Ronan about the trust and confidence implied in that collaboration. \"Yeah, yeah, he never implied that that was a big deal,\" he replied. \"But I always felt that incredible sense of pressure, not wanting to let him down. I felt that actually probably more deeply than the kind of external pressure of how the film might be received, or the expectations that come with his, you know, comeback.\"",
      "An unexpected return eagerly awaited. Yet, Daniel Day-Lewis is muted in his expectations: \"We don't last long. Film sometimes can have a long life, and I suppose you can't help hoping that something of your work will be significant to a person in times to come. But there's, yeah, no guarantee of that.\"",

    "summary": "The \"Hannah Montana\" actress-turned-Grammy-winning pop star talks about her album \"Something Beautiful,\" sobriety, and reconnecting with her dad through music.",
    "story": [
      "Miley Cyrus has been in the public eye for most of her life, and while you might know her music, don't think you really know her.",
      "Asked what it's like to go through life and have strangers think they know her, Cyrus replied, \"I love my life, so I don't ever really have \u2013 I haven't made too much of a list of the things that are negative about it, 'cause there's so many great things. But I would say one of the things that I don't love and don't appreciate so much is when you meet somebody and they go, 'Wow, you're like, so cool. You're so smart. You're nothing like I thought you would be.' So yeah, that's a tough one.\"",
      "Her ninth album might not be what you'd expect, either. In \"Something Beautiful,\" Cyrus stretches herself artistically. As one critic put it, the album takes her from pop princess to legacy artist. That's quite a leap, even for someone with music in their blood.",
      "Miley's mom, Tish Cyrus Purcell, is a producer. Dad is country star Billy Ray Cyrus. Her godmother? Dolly Parton.",
      "Miley Cyrus lived with showbiz royalty, and that raspy voice, all her life: \"I've sounded like this since I was little. My dad used to have all the country singers come over to the house, and George Jones would, you know, joke that I had smoked cigarettes or been up all night, you know, even when I was four years old.\"",
      "At age 13, she was suddenly famous after being cast as \"Hannah Montana,\" in the Disney Channel series about a girl who was a typical teen by day and a pop star by night. It's a role she's still proud of: \"I love her. She's everything. I would have nothing, none of this \u2013 I mean, maybe I could've figured it out, maybe I could've gotten myself from Nashville, Tennessee, to Los Angeles. I don't know. But she did it a lot faster, and better, and set me up for the life that I have now. So love her, gratitude, all of that.\"",
      "The years after \"Hannah Montana\" were a bit less wholesome. Her 2013 MTV Music Video Awards performance was met with shock and outrage, especially among moms of young kids who had grown up watching her as a Disney star.",
      "I asked, \"There were moms that were trying to, I guess, cancel you?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I was the first person to maybe ever be canceled, I guess.\"",
      "\"How would you describe that time in your life?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, I didn't know until I was older actually how brutal it really was,\" Cyrus said. \"It was very, I guess, you know, challenging for other people. But for me it was a good time. It looked fun, and it was fun.\"",
      "Eventually it was all a little too much fun. Cyrus says she's been sober for a few years now.",
      "\"How has sobriety affected you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I like showing up 100%, 100% of the time,\" Cyrus replied. \"The hardest part about balancing, you know, any sort of substance use or drinking when you want to do what I do is you're going, 'Okay, well, now I have to get sober for this thing, 'cause I wanna show up my best.' And now, I get to trim out so much of the preparation of getting yourself into the right place mentally and physically. I'm just always ready.\"",
      "Something she was ready for: \"Flowers,\" the biggest pop single of 2023, and her biggest record to date.",
      "She was also ready for this: Her first two Grammys, for best pop solo performance and record of the year, for \"Flowers.\" Accepting the Grammy she said, \"This award is amazing, but I hope it doesn't change anything, because my life was beautiful yesterday.\"",
      "For Miley Cyrus, today is looking good as well.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" joined her this summer at L.A.'s Million Dollar Theatre, where she was shooting a music video for the deluxe version of \"Something Beautiful.\" The song is \"Secrets,\" and if you think it sounds a bit like Fleetwood Mac, you're right: you can hear drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on the track.",
      "Miley sings about a white flag of surrender, and her outfit is basically a white flag in itself. She told us the song is meant as a peace offering to her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. They'd been estranged since her parents' divorce in 2022.",
      "Asked how he reacted when she gave him the song, Miley replied, \"My dad cried. You know, you don't see your dad cry a lot. But with me and my dad, we just have always communicated better through music with each other.\"",
      "\"And you're at peace now with each other?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "And at 32, it seems Miley Cyrus is at peace with herself.",
      "\"I think the authentic joy of doing what I want to do has always eclipsed the negatives for me,\" she said. \"I feel really good. And I really like who I am, and I like what I'm doing with my life. And I think if I was outside of myself, I would want to be a part of what I'm doing in any way that I could be. 'Cause I think what I'm doing is cool. So, that actually feels good. I like what I do. I like who I am.\"",

      "Through her groundbreaking observations while living among chimpanzees in the jungles of Tanzania, anthropologist and conservationist Jane Goodall (April 3, 1934-Oct. 1, 2025) transformed the study of the animal world after witnessing chimps fashioning and using tools, which at the time was believed to be unique to humans. Her field research also documented the distinct personalities of the chimps she studied. Through her books, articles, documentary films and public appearances over six decades, Goodall changed how the world perceived homo sapien's closest relative in all their emotional and social complexity.",
      "Her fascination with animals began in childhood, spending hours in a tree reading \"Tarzan.\" \"There was no TV back then,\" Goodall told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2021. \"That's when my dream began. I'll go to Africa, live with animals, write books about them. That was it. No intention of being a scientist, because girls didn't do that sort of thing.\"",
      "Working in Nairobi as an assistant to Louis Leakey, the paleoanthropologist raised money for Goodall to spend six months studying chimpanzees in the Gombe rain forest in Tanzania bringing her \"fresh pair of eyes and fiery spirit,\" she said. \"I clearly was passionate. I clearly had an understanding of animals. And he felt that women might be better in the field, that we might be more patient. Also, he wanted somebody who hadn't been to college, so he wanted an unbiased mind.\"",
      "Living among the chimpanzees, she eventually gained the animals' trust. She witnessed chimps fashioning and using tools \u2014 using twigs to fish for termites. She also detected chimps having distinct personalities and share \"human\" emotions, like pleasure, sadness and fear. She documented the bond between mother and child, and sibling rivalry. \"A lot of people refused to believe it,\" Goodall said. \"Why should they believe this young girl? She hadn't even been to college!\"",
      "But National Geographic sent cameraman Hugo van Lawick, and his film corroborated her findings. He also photographed Goodall \u2014 and became her husband.",
      "She later founded the Jane Goodall Institute, and devoted decades of her life to education about and advocacy for protecting the environment. She gave lectures and toured; she was typically on the road 300 days a year, and was in California on a speaking tour when she died.",
      "Four years ago, Goodall was asked by \"Sunday Morning\" why she persisted in such a grueling schedule. \"Because there's a message to get out, and I'm getting older, and there's less time left ahead of me, and the world's falling to pieces,\" she replied. \"Everybody can do something. I mean, when you go shopping you can ask yourself, 'Hmm, did this product harm the environment when it was made? Was it cruel to animals? Is it cheap?\u00a0Why\u00a0is it cheap? Is it cheap because of unfair wages? \u2026 If they care about the future, especially if they've got children, you don't have to do it all. You know, even if you just pick one thing, like eating less meat. Just do\u00a0something.\""

      "Jane Fonda announced Wednesday that she had launched a 21st-century incarnation of the Committee for the First Amendment, originally formed in 1947 in response to congressional hearings probing screenwriters and directors \u2014 notably the so-called \"Hollywood Ten\" \u2014 and their alleged Communist ties. Signers of the new organization's mission statement include\u00a0Florence Pugh,\u00a0Sean Penn,\u00a0Billie Eilish,\u00a0Pedro Pascal\u00a0and hundreds of others.",

      "\"The federal government is once again engaged in a coordinated campaign to silence critics in the government, the media, the judiciary, academia, and the entertainment industry,\" the Committee for the First Amendment's mission statement reads, in part.",
      "\"We refuse to stand by and let that happen. Free speech and free expression are the inalienable rights of every American of all backgrounds and political beliefs \u2014 no matter how liberal or conservative you may be. The ability to criticize, question, protest, and even mock those in power is foundational to what America has always aspired to be,\" the statement reads.",
      "Other famous supporters from the list of more than 550 people included Alyssa Milano, Barbra Streisand, Ben Stiller, Julianne Moore,\u00a0Lily Tomlin, Mandy Patinkin, Melanie Griffith, Natalie Portman, Nicolas Cage, Olivia Wilde, Susan Sarandon, Viola Davis, Whoopi Goldberg and Winona Ryder.",
      "The Fondas each have had long histories of activism, whether Jane Fonda's opposition to the Vietnam War or Henry Fonda's prominent support for Democratic Party candidates, including John F. Kennedy, for whom the elder Fonda\u00a0appeared in a campaign ad\u00a0in 1960.",
      "In recent years, Jane Fonda has been using her platform to draw attention to climate change. She founded the\u00a0Jane Fonda Climate PAC\u00a0in 2022 to help \"climate champions\" win in mayoral, city council, state and presidential races.",
      "\"This isn't just about the environment,\" she told CBS News in September 2024. \"This is about the whole planet.\"",
      "In 2019,\u00a0she was arrested\u00a0five times during\u00a0Fire Drill Fridays, a\u00a0protest series\u00a0she started in Washington, D.C., that was designed to draw attention to global warming. Fonda even spent the night of her 82nd birthday behind bars. The last time Fonda had spent the night in jail was in 1970, when she was 32, while on a speaking tour protesting the Vietnam War.",
      "Henry Fonda, who died in 1982, joined the 1947 First Amendment committee along with such actors and filmmakers as Humphrey Bogart, John Huston, Lucille Ball and Frank Sinatra. Although highly publicized at the time, the committee had a short and troubled history. Bogart and others would find themselves accused of Communist sympathies and would express surprise when a handful of the Hollywood Ten, including screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, turned out to have been Communist Party members at one time or another.",
      "By the following year, Bogart had published an essay in Photoplay magazine entitled \"I'm No Communist,\" in which he confided that \"actors and actresses always go overboard about things\" and warned against being \"used as dupes by Commie organizations.\" Trumbo and others in the Hollywood Ten would be jailed for refusing to cooperate with Congress and found themselves among many to be blacklisted through the end of the 1950s and beyond.",

      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

      "\"This is a major, major step, and we have to do it,\" Makary told CBS News when asked if, even with the discounts, the drugs will still be unaffordable for many Americans.",

Although she she says she has good insurance, it has repeatedly failed to cover the specialty medication her doctor prescribed to slow the progression of her disease. In 2024, when her physician recommended a treatment that could help, she says her insurance company denied coverage three times. She was only approved after the Maryland attorney general intervened.",

      "More than 90% of Americans have some form of health insurance, yet many still struggle to afford critical medications. Wisniewski told CBS News she is skeptical about the new TrumpRx program.",
      "\"If big pharma isn't required to put their drugs on this market, and if they're not forced to lower prices, then this feels like a toothless, symbolic statement, as opposed to having any real, long-term impact on the lives of the clinically ill,\" she said.",

      "Planned Parenthood said \u2060Texas has barred the organization from the state's Medicaid program since 2021, but that the latest ruling means Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast can no longer accept Medicaid in its Louisiana health centers.\u2060",
      "Planned Parenthood has warned of other possible closures nationwide amid Medicaid funding cuts in Mr. Trump's spending and tax bill, which instructs the government to halt Medicaid payments for a year to certain abortion providers.",
      "But while many Planned Parenthood clinics provide abortion services, the clinics in Louisiana that closed had not offered abortion services at any time in their 40-year history, according to the New Orleans Health Department. Planned Parenthood has never had a license to perform abortions in Louisiana, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Last year, the clinic in New Orleans served about 16,000 patients for sexually transmitted infection care and testing, and almost 9,000 patients for family planning care, including birth control and pregnancy tests, according to Planned Parenthood data provided by the New Orleans Health Department.",
      "\"We know that Planned Parenthood New Orleans on Claiborne Avenue served tens of thousands of patients a year with sexual and reproductive health services, and that clinic was important, because it was open access for people who were uninsured or underinsured people who didn't feel comfortable going elsewhere,\" said Jeannie Donovan, deputy director of population health and disease prevention at the New Orleans Health Department. \"It served a real need in our community.\"",
      "Donovan said her department has been working hard to fill the gap for people who relied on the New Orleans clinic for health care needs, creating new maps and databases for patients to find new primary care options.",
      "The clinics in New Orleans and Baton Rouge provided nearly 30,000 tests for sexually transmitted infections, as well 1,800 cancer screenings and 655 ultrasounds. They saw 14,400 visits for birth control, the AP reported.",
      "\"While this chapter closes, community leaders and stakeholders continue to explore possible pathways to carry forward the mission of advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights in Louisiana,\" said Melaney Linton, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, in a statement to CBS News. \"Though that future will not be possible through PPGC, the need remains urgent, and this fight is not over.\"",
      "Some, however, cheered the closures. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said on social media Tuesday, \"This is a win for babies, a win for mothers, and a win for LIFE!\"",
      "\"Planned Parenthood built its business around promoting death,\" said Attorney General Liz Murrill. \"Louisiana proudly stands for life. We will always protect women and babies here in our State.\"",
      "Planned Parenthood said in July that 200 clinics \u2014 of about 600 \u2014 across the U.S. are also at risk of closing as a result of federal policy changes and funding cuts, although the organization is trying to have its funding restored through the courts.",
      "Last week, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin announced it would stop scheduling abortions, and the Arizona affiliate announced it would stop providing care to people covered by Medicaid. Those changes come after five clinics in California, as well as eight in Iowa and Minnesota, closed their doors earlier this year.",
      "Planned Parenthood is now absent in four states \u2014 Louisiana, Wyoming, Mississippi and North Dakota.",
      "Posters with encouraging words for the New Orleans clinic's staff were taped to the clinic's back gate on Tuesday, including one saying \"heroes work here,\" and another saying, \"we appreciate all you have done.\"",
      "Donovan, with the New Orleans Health Department, believes more challenges are ahead for other public health clinics in Louisiana.",
      "\"The implementation of HR-1, or the 'Big Beautiful Bill,' is presenting similar challenges of limiting access to health, potentially hurting the finances of medical providers as fewer people have Medicaid in the city, which is projected,\" Donovan said.",

      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",

      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

      "When the government shuts down, many federal workers go without paychecks, whether they are deemed essential and required to show up for work or whether they're furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "Such employees are by law entitled to back pay once a funding agreement is reached, but independent contractors who sell goods or services to the U.S. government are not similarly protected.",
      "Dan Koh, the former chief of staff at the Labor Department under President Biden, recently said on his podcast that workers employed by companies that have contracts with the government are hurt in a shutdown.",
      "That's because there's no guarantee such workers will be paid once the government reopens, according to Koh. But even federal workers who eventually receive back pay can suffer during a shutdown, as many of them live paycheck to paycheck, he added.",
      "\"Even if you are entitled to back pay, a lot of people can't go even a couple of days without their regularly scheduled paycheck,\" he told CBS News. \"If you have to pay your subway fare, for gas, if something breaks in your home, and you're not getting paid, it places extreme stress on government employees,\" he said.",
      "Members of Congress and the President continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown.",
      "Who gets paid and who does not?",
      "Federal workers, including both furloughed and excepted government employees, receive back pay under a federal law guaranteeing that they'll eventually be made whole.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019\u00a0states that workers who are furloughed due to a lapse in federal funding, as well as excepted workers who are considered essential and required to work without being paid, all receive back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "By contrast, workers and businesses that contract with the government are not similarly guaranteed delayed compensation.",
      "Roughly 620,000 people, or about 28% of federal workers, are projected to be furloughed during the shutdown, according to an Oxford Economics analysis of government data. Additionally, millions of private sector workers who are supported by federal grants and contracts could see their pay be affected by the shutdown, according to the economic advisory firm.",
      "The group estimates that the government supports up to an additional 10 million private workers through federal grants and contracts.",
      "In 2024, the federal government spent about $755 billion on contracts for a wide variety of goods and services, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "\"The government is the largest buyer of goods and services, so when they are not paying, it's not ripples, it's waves,\" Aron Beezley, co-leader of the Government Contracts Practice Group at Bradley, a national law firm, told CBS News.",
      "Personnel needed to process payment",
      "Some federal contracts are fully funded, meaning the government has already allocated money to a given job, and it's likely to continue.",
      "\"If your contract is fully funded by the previous year's appropriations, your contract will go forward, generally speaking,\" he told CBS News.",
      "But even then, companies can expect snags in getting paid on schedule during a shutdown. That's because government personnel tasked with processing contractor invoices might not be at work.",
      "\"When you submit invoices during a shutdown, the system the government uses to pay contractors requires human involvement. Invoices need to be reviewed, and a lot of times a contractor has questions for the folks who process invoices,\" Beezley explained.",
      "As a result, contractors with fully funded contracts can encounter practical impediments to receiving payments they are owed.",
      "\"If nobody is home to process the invoice, it can be challenging to get paid, which can create cash flow issues, particularly for small businesses,\" Beezley said.",
      "Partially funded contracts",
      "A company with an incrementally funded government contract may find itself in a more precarious financial position. Under such contracts, the government pays a business for the work it does as a job progresses.",
      "\"During a shutdown, the funds might not be there for a contractor, and in such situations, those contractors are looking at whether they need to stop working or keep going, and try to get the government to pay them later,\" Beezley said.",
      "Even when contractors want to continue doing their jobs, they might be impeded by practical obstacles.",
      "\"Say a person who unlocks a government facility in the morning has been furloughed and a contractor shows up Monday morning and can't get into the facility \u2014 that impacts their performance,\" Beezley said.",
      "Federal agencies have the discretion to terminate such contracts, at which point a company can decide whether or not to continue paying workers, or assign them to another job.",
      "\"Most contracting companies out of goodness of heart don't keep paying janitors,\" Koh said. \"So in effect, most of them aren't getting paid.\"",
      "Attempts at legislation",
      "In 2023, Sen. Tina Smith, a Democratic Senator for Minnesota, introduced legislation to secure back pay for federal contract workers facing layoffs during a potential shutdown.",
      "\"Contractor employees perform jobs that are critical to the operation of our government, providing food service, security, and doing custodial work,\" Smith said in a statement at the time. \"These are often low-wage jobs that mean workers are living paycheck to paycheck. In the past, these workers haven't received back pay at the end of a government shutdown like the thousands of government employees. And it's time we right that wrong.\"",
      "The bill failed to advance.",
      "Small businesses",
      "As far as ripple effects go, businesses in places like Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland, that depend on government workers' patronage could start feeling a pinch if the shutdown drags on for more than a few weeks. Without cash in their pockets, such workers are expected to pull back on their discretionary spending, according to economists.",
      "\"If a shutdown is prolonged, there will be repercussions for businesses in certain areas with a large number of federal workers, if they aren't being paid,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics told CBS News. \"Areas that rely on the government workforce to spend at their business could be vulnerable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Apple has removed an app used to track Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from its App Store, with the developer saying in a social media post that it had been told by the technology company that its ICEBlock app had been removed due to \"objectionable content.\"",
      "The app, which is free, relies on crowdsourcing to track ICE agents, with the company noting that it allows people to report sightings of ICE activities \"within a 5 mile radius of your current location.\" The app crossed 1 million downloads a month ago, the developer said. In its social media post, the ICEBlock developer blamed \"pressure from the Trump Admin.\" for the decision.",
      "\"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.\"",
      "In a comment to CBS News, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said the Department of Justice had asked Apple to remove the app.",
      "\"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store \u2014 and Apple did so,\" Bondi said. \"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed. This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.\"",
      "ICEBlock is one of a number of apps designed to let users track and anonymously report immigration agents. Another such tool, called Coqui, was still available on the App Store as of Friday morning. Some migrants are relying on the apps to alert them to the location of ICE agents to avoid arrest amid the Trump administration's ramp up of deportation activities.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, told CBS News that apps that track ICE agents \"put the lives of the men and women of law enforcement in danger as they go after terrorists, vicious gangs and violent criminal rings.\"",
      "She added, \"But, of course, the media spins this correct decision for Apple to remove these apps as them caving to pressure instead of preventing further bloodshed and stopping law enforcement from getting killed.\"",

      "\"There's always a form of free speech and a lot of things in technology, and we understand that and respect that, but where it crosses a line is when it becomes dangerous, not only to the ICE officers ...,\" Sheahan said at the time. She added, \"If it's impeding in law enforcement effort, that's where that line comes in as well.\"",

    "summary": "The number of unemployed people looking for work more than six months has surged to its highest level since 2021.",
    "story": [
      "When Anna Whitlock was let go from her job in the technology industry in November of 2024, she wasn't worried about lining up a new position. The Washington state resident had 11 years of experience managing network infrastructure projects, a specialized role that involves equipping buildings with internet access, cameras and wifi security systems.",
      "\"The last time I had to job search, I found something pretty easily,\" she said.",
      "Almost a year later, the 37-year-old is still without a job. Whitlock said she has applied to hundreds of jobs \u2014 even for positions she's overqualified for \u2014 to no avail.",
      "\"The more I looked, the more I wasn't getting responses. If I did have an interview, I only made it the first one or two rounds,\" said Whitlock, who has a 16-year-old daughter. \"Things got really real when my unemployment ran out.\"",
      "Sidelined for months",
      "While the government's September jobs report\u00a0wasn't released on Friday\u00a0because of the government shutdown, other recent economic signals point to an increasingly challenging job market for people like Whitlock. Private employers\u00a0declined by 32,000 jobs\u00a0in September, according to payroll processing firm ADP. The number of job openings around the U.S. has also steadily dropped, economic data shows.",
      "And while the nation's unemployment rate remains historically low, at 4.3%, the share of Americans defined as long-term unemployed \u2014 or those unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26%, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "As of August, the number of long-term unemployed people had risen to 1.9 million, according to government data \u2014 the highest level since 2021, when the nation was still reeling from the pandemic.",
      "With the job market faltering in recent months as employers put the brakes on hiring, more workers are being sidelined for months on end, economists told CBS News.",
      "\"We're continuing to see this low-hire, low-fire environment,\" said Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. \"There aren't really new jobs being opened up for people \u2014 there isn't room for new people to come in.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Thursday captures the dimming view many Americans have of the labor market, with 33% of respondents describing it as \"good,\" down from 41% in April. What's more, 48% said they think there are fewer good jobs where they live compared to five years ago.",
      "1,000 job applications",
      "The rise in long-term unemployed Americans poses two risks, Ullrich said. Workers themselves can suffer financial setbacks as they burn through savings and take on debt to stay afloat. And the broader U.S. economy can suffer if people give up on looking for work after becoming discouraged at the prospects of finding a job.",
      "\"Folks who do go into this long-term unemployment category, it's harder for them to get back into the labor force,\" he said. \"The concern is that they become discouraged workers and they stop working, and then they fall out of the labor force entirely.\"",
      "People who have been hunting for a job for months say the process is both frustrating and demoralizing, especially after sending hundreds of applications that fail to get a response. James Strawn, 55, a software quality expert in Colorado who lost his job in July, said he's submitted 100 applications and only received one response.",
      "\"I've had people say, 'Those are rookie numbers, like that is nothing \u2014 I've submitted 1,000 applications',\" he told CBS News. \"Every morning when I get on LinkedIn \u2014 I'm on there all day now \u2014 I see another post that's like another horror story of looking for jobs.\"",
      "Strawn said he was rejected from a minimum wage job at a fitness center, and has taken on a seasonal job at UPS. But he's increasingly fearful that he may not find work in his technology field by year-end, when his severance pay runs out.",
      "Strawn also worries that ageism could be playing a role in his struggle to land a job in his field. \"It's going to take a small miracle to find something,\" he said. \"It's really tough \u2014 it's really a bad market.\"",
      "It's not only experienced workers who are struggling. Young workers and recent college graduates are also having a hard time breaking into the job market. Because there's a glut of workers looking for jobs, employers are requiring that applicants have more extensive \u00a0resumes, Ullrich told CBS News.",
      "\"They are asking for more years of experience, like nine-plus,\" she said. \"Most of it is because they can.\"",
      "The unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds is \"slowly but steadily rising,\" said Elise Gould, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"I was quickly humbled\"",
      "Matthew McMeans, who graduated from the University of Memphis last year, estimates he applied to roughly 500 jobs during an 18-month job search before landing a position as a full stack software engineer in early August. He described the job hunt as \"miserable\" and \"degrading\" given the difficulty in landing interviews.",
      "\"When I started my degree, the hopes were really high that you were going to get multiple offers when you graduated,\" the 23-year-old said. \"But as soon as I started really searching and applying, I was quickly humbled.\"",
      "The wobbly labor market has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve, which has a so-called dual mandate to keep both unemployment and inflation low. Last month, the central bank\u00a0cut interest rates for the first time since December 2024 in an effort to bolster the labor market.",
      "But even if the job market improves, for many the damage has already been done. Whitlock, the IT professional who has been unemployed for almost a year, said she's managed to get assistance through programs like SNAP, better known as food stamps, and to negotiate down her cell phone and car insurance bills.",
      "But she was also forced to liquidate her retirement fund and a small investment account to make sure she had enough to live on.",
      "Said Whitlock, \"I'm probably right now in a position where I've got maybe three months until I'm in a really bad spot.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 12:31:05 -0400",
    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

      "Many Americans are eager to put money away for retirement, but that goal is increasingly out of reach because more workers are living paycheck to paycheck, a new Goldman Sachs study finds.",
      "Roughly 42% of younger working Americans \u2014 spanning Gen Z, millennials and Gen X \u2014 report having no spare savings after covering their basic living expenses, according to the analysis, which surveyed about 3,600 workers and 1,500 retirees. Among those just getting by, about three-quarters said they are struggling to save for retirement, the survey found.",
      "The share of U.S. workers in this precarious financial position has grown significantly since 1997, when 31% lived paycheck to paycheck, according to Goldman. The investment bank projects that figure could climb to well over half of Americans by 2033 as essentials like housing and health care continue to rise in cost.",
      "\"Save more\" ignores reality",
      "The findings underscore the challenges millions of Americans now face just making ends meets while also managing to set aside money for retirement, a financial pinch that Goldman Sachs calls a \"financial vortex.\" That money crunch helps explains why more than a quarter of older Americans are nearing retirement without anything saved \u2014 a gap that could widen given the financial pressures facing younger workers.",
      "\"These findings force us to ask a very critical question: Does the retirement math still work? The answer is no,\" said Greg Wilson, head of retirement at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in a conference call to discuss the report. \"Telling workers just to 'save more' ignores the realities they face.\"",
      "Skipping a latte or avocado toast isn't likely to make much of a dent in the financial dynamics facing workers today, with Goldman finding that basic expenses are consuming an ever growing share of people's after-tax income.",
      "For instance, homeownership now eats up 51% of income, up from 33% in 2000, while health care costs account for 16% of after-tax earnings, up from 10% a quarter century ago, the analysis found.",
      "\"The mounting challenges American workers face ... make it harder than ever to save for retirement,\" Wilson said.",
      "Such financial pressures come as many Americans are on their own to plan, and save for, their retirement, largely because of the shift in the 1980s from company-sponsored pensions to 401(k) plans.",
      "As a savings vehicle, 401(k) shifts the burden onto workers, who must decide how much to save, how to invest and how to draw down their money in retirement \u2014 a do-it-yourself approach that retirement experts such as Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research in New York,\u00a0describe as inadequate.",
      "Hoping for a miracle",
      "Financial professionals say it's no coincidence that members of Generation X, which entered the workforce just as the shift to 401(k)s became mainstream, is feeling unprepared as they get closer to retirement. Now 45 to 60 years old, almost half said they believed it would take a \"miracle\" for them to be able to retire, a Natixis study found last year.",
      "Goldman acknowledged that it can be difficult to close a retirement funding gap with savings alone, but noted that some strategies could help. Some approaches may be out of reach for older workers, like Gen X and millennials, but could be of use for their children \u2014 for instance, setting aside $500 a year from ages 1 to 20, a move Goldman found could increase retirement savings by 14%.",
      "Adding private market investments to a portfolio could also help boost retirement savings by 14% through higher returns, according to Goldman. Those strategies might become more accessible for workers under a Trump administration plan to open up 401(k)\u00a0plans to private equity, cryptocurrencies and other alternative investments.",
      "Lastly, if possible, workers should take advantage of benefits from their employers such as funding an emergency savings account, which can help them avoid raiding their 401(k) in case of an unexpected expense, such as medical bills, the bank notes.",
      "Even so, while those approaches might work for workers with access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, about half of all U.S. private-sector workers\u00a0lack access to such programs, an analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts found earlier this year. Although it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to an employer retirement plan said they struggled to build wealth, the Pew survey found.",

      "The demands are outlined in a nine-page document, title the \"Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,\" that asks schools to freeze their tuition rate for five years, ban the use of sex and gender as factors in their admissions process, and cap their international student numbers, among other requirements.",
      "Signatories also must commit to \"transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas,\" according to the memo.",

May Mailman, a senior adviser for special projects at the White House, told the paper that the Trump administration doesn't plan to limit funding only to institutions that agree to abide by the compact. However, schools that sign the agreement will be granted priority in receiving federal funding and engaging with White House officials.",
      "\"Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,\" the agreement states.",

      "\"Penn must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding its self-determination,\" the group said. \"Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university.\"",
      "The agreement places a cap on foreign student enrollment, which it states cannot exceed 15% of a university's undergraduate population. Also, no more than 5% of foreign students enrolled at a college can come from a single country.",
      "\"Universities that rely on foreign students to fund their institutions risk, among other things, potentially reducing spots available to deserving American students,\" the document states.",
      "The nine schools are also asked to freeze tuition for five years and to waive tuition for students pursuing \"hard science programs\" at institutions where the endowment exceeds $2 million per undergraduate student. Schools would not have to freeze tuition for students from \"families of exceptional means,\" under the agreement.",

      "Just over half call the job market bad, and that's a tougher evaluation than Americans gave six months ago when views were more mixed.",
      "Some of that may be driven by prospective outlook. Most who are currently employed do feel at least somewhat, if not very, secure in their jobs right now. Yet most Americans think if they were looking for a job, it would be difficult to find the kind of job they want.",
      "When asking them to compare longer-term job market trends they're seeing, the picture is mixed, and the jobs market is not seen as growing. By 4 to 1, Americans think there are fewer \u2014 not more \u2014 good jobs where they live than there were five years ago, and the rest see it holding steady. Even workers who feel they have some job security tend to think there are fewer, not more, good jobs out there.",
      "As is often the case with economic evaluations, partisanship plays a role. Republicans are less likely than Democrats to hold negative views of the job market and the economy overall.",
      "As an ongoing string of discussions and reports speak to the potential impact of AI across a number of fields and the workplace, Americans overall hold a skeptical outlook, on balance. They feel AI will have a net-negative effect on job availability in their fields over the next ten years. This is the case for those currently working as well as those not.",
      "Given that, more broadly, many believe the development of AI and AI companies will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy overall. This view spans both education and income levels, though it is a little less pronounced among younger Americans.",
      "That said, for some, the view is that if a job is available, it could be easier to do as a result of AI.",
      "Overall views of the U.S. economy, which have been net-negative for years, continued to tick slightly down from the summer.",
      "As has long been the case, people in relatively higher income levels report their own personal financial situation being better than those at lower levels. But majorities across incomes do report prices going up.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,489 U.S. adults interviewed between September 30-October 2, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 11:05:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion each week, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The fight over funding the government is likely to be a costly one.",
      "Each week of the ongoing government shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion and reduce GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, according to an estimate published by EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. That cost is a function of reduced pay for federal employees, delayed government procurement of goods and a decline in demand.",
      "To some extent, a portion of that economic cost would be reversed when the government reopens, as furloughed employees receive back pay and economic activity increases, the analysis said.",
      "It's likely that not everything would be reversible, though. The last shutdown \u2014 which was during President Trump's first term and lasted 34 days, beginning in December 2018 and ending in January 2019 \u2014 cost the U.S. economy about $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "During that shutdown, the longest on record, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 took a $3 billion hit (in 2019 dollars). And it estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, real GDP was \"$8 billion lower than it would have been \u2014 an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.\"",
      "The shutdown could shake Americans' faith in the economy, too. EY-Parthenon notes that at the time, the 2019 shutdown led to the sharpest monthly drop in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index up since 2012.",
      "Some of the shutdown costs also stem from the administrative effort necessary to create contingency plans when the government is shut down and reopened. Agencies lose user fees collected from visitors to the national parks or from people seeking certain federal permits or visas. And there are higher premiums in federal contracting during a shutdown and the back pay federal employees eventually receive when the government reopens.",
      "Current federal law requires that federal workers be paid at their regular rate, whether they're furloughed or not, once the government is operating again. In a new analysis cited by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will pay $400 million a day for furloughed employees, who will not be working during the shutdown.",
      "A September 2019 report from a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee estimated the last three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 \"cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion \u2014 at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers, and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue, and late fees on interest payments.\"",
      "The White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that during the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal employees received $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for hours they did not work, plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fees.",
      "2025 shutdown",
      "But this time may be different. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Russell Vought, the OMB director, say layoffs will happen soon if the shutdown continues, so the net fiscal impact of a shutdown to the federal government is a little harder to predict right now. Vought immediately began freezing or slashing federal funding for projects, largely in blue states, during the shutdown. The Trump administration is withholding $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, and cutting funding for climate-related projects in many states that Kamala Harris won.",
      "Vought also told Republican lawmakers Wednesday that Reduction in Force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 cuts would begin in two days.",
      "The president said Tuesday \"a lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" and suggested Vought could use the shutdown to permanently cut federal workers and programs the administration doesn't want but that have the backing of Democrats.",
      "\"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible for them, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,\" Mr. Trump said of Democrats. \"Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 11:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced 'most favored nation' cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House has released specific drug prices yet.",
      "Some health policy experts cautioned that pricing details are still unclear and the impact for consumers may be limited.",
      "Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out that Medicaid's prices are already lower than average in the U.S.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" he told CBS News.",
      "And those patients have been benefiting, says Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at\u00a0KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization: \"It is still very unclear how the price reductions announced today will lower costs directly for many people, since people on Medicaid typically don't pay large amounts out of pocket for drugs.\"",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, said: \"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump. Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\"",
      "Bourla called it a \"historic day\" because the agreement would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on\u00a0drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",

      "\"Not only will it give voters something better and the chance to gain five new Democratic seats. We're doing it in a way that is transparent,\" he said. \"We're going to do it in a way that lets the voters decide.\"",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, also a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is a necessary response to Republican attempts to rig elections elsewhere.",
      "\"Let the people decide, and I'm for it. I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" Villaraigosa said.",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck, a Democrat, supported the plan and said \"we have to preserve Democracy.\" Another Democrat, Katie Porter, who's a law professor and former member of Congress, said she is in \"support of the governor's plan.\"",
      "Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County expressed opposition.",
      "\"It's like saying murder is not acceptable, so I'm going to go murder you,\" Bianco said. \"Let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more.\"",
      "Message to Californians who voted for Trump",
      "The Democratic candidates also explained their message   to the roughly 40% of California voters who supported Donald Trump in 2020, voters whose political representation could be diminished under the new district maps.",
      "The Republican and Green Party Proposition 50 opponents also defended their opposition to pro-redistricting arguments.",
      "Becerra said he would talk to them \"straight out\" and emphasized his intention to win every vote. Becerra also emphasized that now is the time to stand up for the rule of law and Democracy.",
      "\"No one should do power grabs. No one is a king. No one has a right to deny you your vote,\" he said.",
      "Like Becerra, Calderon said his campaign would focus on listening to all voters, not just talking at them.",
      "\"There are a lot of Republicans in the state who don't necessarily love everything Trump is doing,\" Calderon said. \"They just want to be heard.\"",
      "Thurmond echoed similar arguments, saying that many of Mr. Trump's voters may not support all of the president's policies.",
      "\"Most Americans do not support attacks on the immigrant communities or education cuts,\" he said. \"Just because they voted for Trump doesn't mean they agree with everything.\"",
      "Yee acknowledged that some voters, particularly in rural Republican districts, may feel disenfranchised.",
      "\"What I will say to them also is, look, these are areas of the state that actually want to become vital economies. These are areas that actually have probably disproportionate rates of people on Medicaid. These are parts of the states where people are relying on food assistance more than probably other parts,\" Yee said. \"I would just say, who's going to best represent those interests when those cuts are upon you?\"",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck emphasized loyalty to California's interests rather than party politics.",
      "\"I would look at the polls of the state right now. The polls say protect California. Whatever the California customers want, I will be their leader and represent them,\" Cloobeck said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he expects to alienate some voters on both sides, but believes many are still looking for leadership that bridges divides.",
      "\"I know there are Democrats that I might alienate in the course of this race, and there will be Republicans I alienate. There will also be Democrats and some Republicans that want a leader who's a uniter who wants to work with both sides, who wants the focus on common sense. So you win a few, you lose a few.\"",
      "Porter, who has represented a swing district in Orange County, was the only candidate not to directly answer the question, taking issue with the premise that she might need republican voters to win.",
      "\"How would I need them in order to win?\" Porter asked. \"If it is me versus a Republican, I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump.\"",
      "As several of her opponents noted, in\u00a0California's top-two open primary\u00a0system, Republican voters could help put a Democratic candidate over the top.",
      "Porter then threatened to call off the interview, taking issue with too many follow-up questions. She ultimately stayed and continued answering questions.",
      "Do two wrongs make a right?",
      "The candidates also confronted the ethical dilemma\u00a0that even some Prop 50 supporters acknowledge: Does fighting one partisan maneuver with another set the wrong precedent? In other words, do two wrongs make right?",
      "\"It's let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more,\" Bianco said.",
      "Becerra defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington.",
      "\"Donald Trump is afraid he's going to lose his slim majority of Republicans come 2026,\" Becerra said. \"So he's trying to rig the process to give himself more Republicans. That is not a Democratic process. We're going to fight as we need to make sure our votes count.\"",
      "Calderon offered a conflicted view, calling it \"kind of a sh---- choice\" but emphasizing the political stakes.",
      "\"If we're going to have hope of any type of leverage during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress.\"",
      "Ware warned voters not to fall for partisan manipulation.",
      "\"This doesn't serve the voters of California. It serves the DNC. It does not help us. It helps them,\" Ware said. \"They are using Californians essentially as a prop in their battle between Democrats and Republicans.\"",
      "Porter said it's not two wrongs, highlighting the nature in which Texas approached its redistricting.",
      "\"What Texas is doing is acting out of the course of the census, not following new census data\u2026 They're doing it because Donald Trump instructed them to do it,\" she said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he's for letting the people decide on the matter to challenge corruption.",
      "\"I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" he said.",
      "Thurmond called the special election on Proposition 50 \"an important moment for voters to decide.\"",
      "Yee reaffirmed her stance on California's move to counter Texas' redistricting effort.",
      "\"Just the idea that there's manipulation that is being directed from the top that's going to affect California's proportionate representation, we have to fight back,\" she said.",
      "Cloobeck also highlighted California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"Donald Trump's actions have been such that he wants to just attack California. He has not shown us any gratitude for all the billions of dollars of tax dollars the federal government gets from California,\" he said.",
      "Hilton described the difficulty California faces in properly redrawing its congressional districts mid-decade rather than after the federal census every 10 years.",
      "\"By drawing these maps in the middle, they don't know who lives where,\" he said. \"Millions of people have left California. In Los Angeles, whole communities have burned down. Who knows who lives there? There's no way that they can honor that constitutional requirement.\"",
      "Hilton stressed that even before Newsom's redistricting effort, California already had \"a massively distorted political map.\"",
      "Acknowledging that Republicans make up about 40% of the vote in California but have just 17% of the congressional seats, Hilton said, \"With this new plan that they've got, it would be down to 6%.\"",
      "Hilton argued that those voters are being pushed out of representation altogether, saying that the plan would unfairly increase the weight of Democratic votes by as much as eight times compared to Republican ones.",
      "\"We're completely violating the principle of equal protection, the whole idea,\" Hilton said.",
      "While candidates differ sharply on Proposition 50, voters will have the final say. The redistricting plan will go before voters in a special election on November 4. If approved, the new congressional maps would remain intact through the 2030 election.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 23:20:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Illinois and Chicago have sued the Trump administration to block deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, though it was revealed in court that troops are already on the way.",
    "story": [
      "As Illinois and Chicago filed suit to block the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, a judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order Monday afternoon, and it was revealed that troops are already on their way.",
      "\"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president's favor,\" the lawsuit states in its introduction.",
      "In the lawsuit, which names both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago as plaintiffs, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul writes, \"Defendants' deployment of federalized troops to Illinois is patently unlawful.\" He continues, \"Plaintiffs ask this court to halt the illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional federalization of members of the National Guard of the United States, including both the Illinois and Texas National Guard.\"",
      "Raoul is asking for a temporary restraining order, saying deployment will cause \"additional unrest,\" \"mistrust of police,\" and harm to the state's economy.",
      "In court, defense attorneys in this case were asked a series of logistical questions, like what cities in Illinois the National Guard would be deployed and they couldn't provide the answers.",
      "The judge said that while she was troubled by the lack of information and details of the operation, she will give those attorneys a couple more days to respond. She did caution lawyers for the Trump administration, \"If I were the federal government, I'd take a pause on this.\"",
      "The judge did not issue a restraining order during Monday's status hearing, instead setting another hearing for arguments on Thursday.",
      "However, it was revealed in court that National Guard troops from Texas are already on their way to Illinois and could be deployed as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday. The Illinois National Guard was ordered to report on Tuesday for training, according to state attorneys.",
      "In a Monday afternoon news conference, Pritzker repeatedly decried what he called the Trump administration's \"unconstitutional invasion\" of Chicago, and said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials are expanding raids and military-style enforcement actions in order to sow chaos that would then justify the deployment of military troops to Chicago.",
      "\"The state of Illinois is going to use every lever at our disposal to resist this power grab and get Noem's thugs the hell out of Chicago,\" Pritzker said. \"I am not afraid. I am not\u00a0afraid. And I will not back down.\"",
      "\"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military,\" said AG Raoul. \"Particularly for the reason that their city or state leadership have fallen out of the president's political favor.\"",
      "Raoul said the state has filed more than 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration so far. He cited the militia clauses of the U.S. Constitution, which give Congress the sole authority to decide where troops are deployed, and the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits military troops from participating in civilian law enforcement.",
      "\"It is unfair to National Guardsmen, it is unfair to local law enforcement, and it is certainly unfair to the law-abiding citizens of Illinois who do not want to be subject to military occupation,\" Raul said.",
      "Raoul said the only situation in the city or state that is \"out of control\" are the ICE agent,s whose overreach he said creates pretext for military deployment, and cited President Trump's own statements that he wants to use American cities as military training grounds and said Chicago \"is about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\"",
      "\"I'm here to say that the president's actions are illegal,\" Raoul said. \"The president has failed to establish that any of the legal prerequisites exist for his efforts to mobilize his National Guard troops here.\"",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson said the lawsuit sends \"a message to the president that Chicago will not be used as a political prop. Chicago will not be intimidated and will not be silent.\"",
      "\"Our city has faced tough times before, and every time we stood strong, because we stood together,\" Johnson said. \"Let's continue to work together to protect our democracy and fight for the future of our country.\"",
      "U.S. Senators for Illinois Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth released a statement in conjunction with other Illinois Democrats, demanding Mr. Trump reverse his decision to deploy National Guard troops.",
      "\"We write to urge you to reverse your reckless decision to federalize and deploy Texas and Illinois National Guard troops to Illinois.\u00a0 Your use of the military to sow fear and chaos in American cities, including over the objections of several Governors, is unconstitutional and un-American, infringes on individual and states' rights, and threatens to undermine military readiness and morale,\" wrote the lawmakers in part.",
      "Over the weekend, a\u00a0federal memo obtained by CBS News\u00a0revealed up to 300 members of the Illinois National Guard would be federalized and deployed to \"protect federal property\" and \"government personnel performing federal functions.\"",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker confirmed that memo and said he had also been told an additional 400 other National Guard members from Texas would be deployed to Chicago and Portland, Oregon.",
      "A\u00a0federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the National Guard to Portland on Sunday.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/illegal-crossings-immigration-us-mexico-southern-border-lowest-level-1970-trump-dhs/",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 23:06:18 -0400",
    "summary": "Unlawful crossings on the southern border have hit a 55-year low, according to figures obtained by CBS News \u2014 as President Trump cracks down on illegal immigration.",
    "story": [
      "Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025 plummeted to the lowest annual level since the early 1970s, amid the Trump administration's sweeping clampdown on illegal immigration, internal federal statistics obtained by CBS News show.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol agents recorded nearly 238,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in fiscal year 2025, which began in October of last year and ended on Sept. 30, according to the preliminary Department of Homeland Security data, which has not been previously reported.",
      "The number is the lowest annual tally recorded by Border Patrol since fiscal year 1970, when the agency reported roughly 202,000 apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border, historical figures indicate.",
      "It also represents a seismic change from the record-high levels of Border Patrol apprehensions recorded under the Biden administration, which faced an unprecedented humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. In fiscal year 2022, Border Patrol made 2.2 million apprehensions there \u2014 a record, and almost 10 times the levels recorded in 2025.",
      "More than 60% of the apprehensions made by Border Patrol in fiscal year 2025 along the U.S.-Mexico border were recorded in the last full three months of the Biden administration, the preliminary data shows. Government fiscal years start in October and end in September, and some of them encompass different administrations.",
      "Over President Trump's first full eight months in office, Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border have recorded fewer than 9,000 apprehensions each month \u2014 a number that the agency recorded in 24-hour periods during some days under former President Joe Biden.",
      "The internal DHS figures show Border Patrol made nearly 8,400 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in September, an increase from 6,300 in August and 4,600 in July, a monthly record low.",
      "Border Patrol apprehensions denote the number of times agents intercepted and processed migrants entering the country between official ports of entry, which is illegal. Some migrants can be counted multiple times, if they attempt to enter the U.S. more than once after being turned back to Mexico.",
      "In a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"President Trump has overwhelmingly delivered on his promise to secure our Southern Border.\"",
      "\"As a result, Americans are safer \u2014 unvetted criminal illegal aliens and dangerous drugs are no longer pouring over our border unchecked,\" Jackson added. \"And for all the Democrats who claimed it was impossible to secure the border or that they needed new policy, turns out all we needed was a new President.\"",
      "\"A new normal\"",
      "Ariel Ruiz Soto, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, noted that illegal border crossings began to fall sharply in the summer of 2024, after the Biden administration enacted strict limits on asylum. But he said the Trump administration had set \"a new normal\" for migration flows in just a few months.",
      "Ruiz Soto said the Trump administration's stringent policies \u2014 at the border and inside the U.S. \u2014 \"have had a significant effect on people being deterred from coming illegally to the United States.\"",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump took office for a second time, his administration moved to seal and militarize the southern border, closing down the American asylum system using emergency powers, dispatching thousands of soldiers to repel illegal crossings and shutting down Biden-era programs that allowed some migrants to enter the U.S. legally.",
      "While parts of the asylum ban have been curtailed and declared illegal by courts, the Trump administration has virtually ended the practice of releasing migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally, deporting them quickly or holding them in detention while their cases are reviewed.",
      "Beyond the border, the Trump administration has staged highly publicized operations targeting those living in the U.S. illegally, dispatching teams of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents across the country with the objective of overseeing a deportation campaign of unprecedented proportions.",
      "The crackdown has not been without controversy. The administration's border policies have been denounced as inhumane, draconian and illegal by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged them in federal court on the grounds that they are at odds with U.S. and international asylum law as well as the Constitution.",
      "The federal immigration raids well beyond the border have also triggered significant backlash, particularly in major American cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, where large-scale protests have erupted. National and local Democrats have decried the raids as indiscriminate and overly harsh, accusing the Trump administration of not solely focusing on deporting violent offenders.",
      "Citing confrontations and instances of violence, Mr. Trump in recent days has ordered National Guard troops to deploy to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, to protect immigration agents and facilities there. A federal judge has so far blocked the plan to send National Guard units to Portland.",
      "Amid the national debate over immigration enforcement, those living along the southern border say there's no denying the reality on the ground has changed markedly.",
      "John Martin said his network of shelters in the Texas border city of El Paso housed hundreds of migrants during spikes in illegal crossings during the Biden administration. On Monday, he said his organization was not housing a single migrant, saying he's received \"little to no\" new arrivals who are not local homeless residents in recent months. He attributed it to Mr. Trump's crackdown.",
      "\"If the goal is to decrease the number of individuals, I would say that appears to have been successful, without getting into the politics about whether or not I like it or dislike it,\" Martin said. \"We're just simply not seeing the people.\"",

    "story": [
      "The FBI analyzed the phone records of more than a half dozen Republican lawmakers as part of an investigation into efforts by President Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to information released Monday by GOP senators.",
      "The records, which the FBI analyzed in 2023, enabled investigators to see basic information about the date and time of phone calls but not the content of the communications, the senators said. The data encompassed several days during the week of Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to halt the certification of the election results.",
      "A document dated Sept. 27, 2023, lists nine Republican lawmakers whose records were allegedly scrutinized: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.",
      "The disclosure adds new detail to the since-shuttered investigation by the FBI and former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith into the steps Mr. Trump took in the run-up to the Capitol riot to undo his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Mr. Trump was indicted in August 2023 with conspiring to overturn the results, but the case was abandoned after Mr. Trump's win the following year because of a Justice Department legal opinion that states sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.",
      "The subpoena for the phone records was disclosed by several Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee that oversees the FBI. Grassley said the Sept. 27, 2023, document memorializing the \"preliminary toll analysis\" was found in response to his request. The investigative step was authorized by a grand jury, the senators said.",
      "Grassley called it a \"violation of personal property and people's rights and the law and their constitutional rights.\"",
      "The document suggests the analysis was conducted by an FBI special agent whose name was redacted, and it was authorized by two supervisory agents. It does not say how or why those lawmakers were identified or whether any meaningful tips or leads emerged from that investigative work.",
      "Some of the lawmakers were part of a group of Republicans who planned to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election. After the voting was disrupted by the rioters on Jan. 6, 2021, most of the lawmakers named in the FBI document voted to certify the results, while Sen. Lummis and Rep. Kelly objected to at least one state.",
      "The special counsel's investigation delved into phone calls between lawmakers and the president on the evening of Jan. 6, 2021, which Smith alleged were part of a last-ditch attempt to talk congressional Republicans into blocking the certification of Biden's victory. The 2023 indictment against Mr. Trump lists several attempts by Mr. Trump and his alleged co-conspirators to reach senators and representatives by phone. It argued the president \"attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol by calling lawmakers to convince them, based on knowingly false claims of election fraud, to delay the certification.\"",
      "Last year, a final report penned by Smith \u2014 which argued the president would have been convicted if not for his 2024 election win \u2014 also pointed to phone calls placed by Mr. Trump and members of his circle. It cited toll records from two unindicted co-conspirators who are unnamed\u00a0but are widely believed to be Rudy Giuliani and one other person.",
      "The senators said they would not be conducting their own investigation because they expected FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino \u2014 both Trump loyalists \u2014 to review the matter. Grassley suggested that more people at the FBI would be fired over the investigation, saying, \"If heads don't roll in this town, nothing changes.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on social media that he had \"grave concerns\" about the incident.",
      "\"I fully support Senate committees getting to the bottom of this outrageous abuse of power and weaponization of the government,\" said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.",
      "CBS News has reached out to theSenate Judicary Committee's Democratic side and to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for comment.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge late Sunday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, after a legal whirlwind that began hours earlier when the president mobilized California troops for Portland after the same judge blocked him from using Oregon's National Guard the day before.",
      "During a hastily called telephone hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut granted a temporary restraining order sought by California and Oregon.",
      "A day earlier, the same judge temporarily blocked\u00a0the administration from deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. But on Sunday, the president moved to send National Guard troops to the state from neighboring California and then from Texas.",
      "Immergut, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, issued her second, more sweeping order late Sunday after she upbraided the federal government's attorney and questioned how the move to send the California and Texas troops to Oregon was not \"in direct contravention of the order that was issued yesterday.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "Small protests have been going on nightly outside Portland's immigration processing facility since Mr. Trump's second term began in January. There have been occasional flare-ups, including in June, but for weeks the demonstrations attracted only a few dozen people \u2014 until the Trump administration mobilized the Oregon National Guard\u00a0on Sept. 28 against Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek's wishes.",
      "A small number of demonstrators gathered Sunday evening cheered when they learned about the judge's order.",
      "Immergut issued Saturday's order pending further arguments in a lawsuit brought by the state and city. She said the relatively small protests didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.",
      "Her Saturday ruling came after Mr. Trump called the city \"war-ravaged.\" Oregon officials and Portland residents alike said that description was ludicrous.",
      "A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement that about 200 federalized members of the California National Guard who had been on duty around Los Angeles were being reassigned to Portland. Kotek said about 100 arrived Saturday and around 100 more were en route Sunday.",
      "The two states originally requested a narrower order that would have blocked only California National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon, but asked for the order to apply to all National Guard troops after a memo written by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was submitted to the court that said up to 400 Texas National Guard personnel were being activated for deployment to Oregon, Illinois and possibly elsewhere.",
      "Immergut grilled lawyers for the federal government, accusing them of seeking an end run around her Saturday order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon.",
      "\"How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention of the TRO I issued yesterday?\" she said Sunday.",
      "Immergut told one federal government attorney that he was \"missing the point\" because conditions on the ground in Oregon hadn't changed and she saw no legal basis and need for the military to assist local law enforcement.",
      "Lawyers for the federal government tried to argue that Oregon and Portland didn't have standing and that California could show no harm by having some of its National Guard dispatched to another state.",
      "Scott Kennedy, the attorney representing Oregon, said he learned of the Texas National Guard mobilization just 24 minutes before the emergency hearing on Sunday night. \"It feels a little bit like we're playing a game of rhetorical whack-a-mole here,\" he told Immergut.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a post on X Sunday night that he'd authorized the call-up of guard troops from his state. \"You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,\" he wrote.",
      "The events in Oregon come a day after Illinois' governor made a similar announcement about troops in his state being activated.",
      "Kotek said the latest move by federal officials is an attempt to circumvent Saturday's court ruling that blocked deployment of Oregon's guard members.",
      "\"The facts on the ground in Oregon haven't changed,\" Kotek said during a news conference Sunday. \"There's no need for military intervention in Oregon. There's no insurrection in Portland, there's no threat to national security.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that personnel from his state were on their way Sunday and called the deployment \"a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.\" He said these troops were \"federalized\" and put under the president's control months ago over his objections, in response to unrest in Los Angeles.",
      "\"The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens,\" Newsom said. In a post on X, he said California would sue to try to stop the deployment.",
      "After Immergut's late Sunday ruling, Newsom said on X, \"We just won in court \u2014 again. ... Trump's abuse of power won't stand.\"",
      "In a related court filing, an attorney in the California Military Department said the U.S. Army Northern Command advised the department on Sunday that an order will be issued keeping the 300 guard personnel federalized through the end of January.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Mr. Trump's move to deploy the National Guard of one state to another \"is well outside of the norms or practices\" of any president.",
      "\"But this President is determined to take as much power as the courts will give him. This fight isn't over, but today's rebuke of the president's illegal actions is a step in the right direction,\" Bonta said in a statement after Sunday night's ruling.",
      "Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said Sunday that he saw federal agents engaged in what he described as unjustified use of force and indiscriminately spraying pepper spray and impact munitions during a protest outside the ICE facility.",
      "\"This is an aggressive approach trying to inflame the situation that has otherwise been peaceful,\" Wilson said.",
      "Portland has alerted the civil rights division of the Department of Justice to the agents' actions, Wilson said.",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed a presidential memorandum\u00a0mobilizing federal law enforcement agents to Memphis, Tennessee, at the request of the Tennessee governor.",

It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state's military troops,\" Pritzker said, calling Texas Gov.

Ambler has a 100% interest in the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in northwestern Alaska.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not take up a bid by Ghislaine Maxwell to overturn her 2021 conviction for sex trafficking.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not take up a bid by Ghislaine Maxwell to overturn her 2021 conviction and 20-year prison sentence for her role in a scheme to sexually exploit and abuse minor girls with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Maxwell's appeal to the high court attracted added attention this summer as the Trump administration came under pressure to release more material related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019. Congress also opened its own examination of the federal probe and has obtained and released thousands of pages of records related to Epstein, though many were already in the public domain.",
      "Senior Justice Department officials unsuccessfully petitioned a federal court in New York to unseal grand jury material in Epstein's case, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell in Tallahassee, Florida, in July to discuss her relationship with Epstein and the allegations against her.",
      "The Supreme Court's rejection of Maxwell's case means her conviction and sentence will remain intact, barring a presidential pardon. Asked Monday afternoon if he's considering a pardon, President Trump told reporters he'll \"take a look at it\" and will speak to the Justice Department, but added, \"I wouldn't consider it or not consider it. I don't know anything about it.\"",
      "At the heart of Maxwell's appeal is a 2007 nonprosecution agreement between the U.S. attorney in Miami and Epstein, which she argued barred her prosecution for sex-trafficking violations.",
      "Epstein's lawyers and then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta entered into the deal after a federal investigation into allegations Epstein engaged in sexual abuse of underage girls. In exchange for avoiding federal charges, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "The agreement specified that if Epstein fulfilled all of its terms, he would not be prosecuted \"in this district,\" the Southern District of Florida. It also contained a so-called co-conspirators clause, which stated that if Epstein satisfied the deal's conditions, the U.S. would \"not institute any criminal char[g]es against any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including but not limited to\" four of his assistants.",
      "A Justice Department official in West Palm Beach later told the department's Office of Professional Responsibility the provision was \"highly unusual,\" and a former prosecutor who handled the case said she didn't consider that Epstein may have been trying to protect anyone other than his four assistants, according to court records.",
      "Acosta went on to serve as labor secretary during Mr. Trump's first term, but he resigned in 2019 amid scrutiny of his handling of the nonprosecution agreement with Epstein. He stepped down shortly after Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in New York. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial.",
      "Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein's, was indicted in New York in 2020 and charged with several criminal offenses arising out of her scheme with Epstein. She attempted to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the co-conspirators clause in Epstein's nonprosecution agreement prohibited her prosecution because she was charged as his co-conspirator.",
      "A federal district court rejected Maxwell's effort, finding that the deal bound only the U.S. Attorney's Office in Florida. It also ruled that most of the charges would've fallen outside the scope of the agreement even if it covered the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York.",
      "Maxwell's trial proceeded, and she was found guilty in 2021. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Maxwell had been serving her sentence at a federal correctional facility in Tallahassee, but she was moved to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas after meeting with Blanche, the deputy attorney general, in July.",
      "She appealed her conviction and sentence on several grounds, including that the nonprosecution deal barred her prosecution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected her claims, ruling that \"nothing in the text of the NPA precluded\" the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan from bringing charges against Maxwell.",
      "Maxwell asked the Supreme Court to take up her case in April, arguing that the co-conspirator clause contained no \"geographic limitation\" on where it could be enforced. Her lawyers said in a filing that a decision from the Supreme Court should ensure that plea deals are enforced consistently throughout the country, \"so that when the United States makes a promise in a plea agreement, it is held to that promise.\"",
      "But the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court not to reconsider Maxwell's conviction and sentence. It noted that Justice Department policy at the time the deal was negotiated prohibited U.S. attorneys from entering into agreements that bound other districts unless they received written approval from those districts or the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.",
      "\"There is no indication here that anyone involved in negotiating Epstein's NPA obtained the necessary approval for binding other USAOs or thought it was necessary,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration said violent crime rose in Memphis in 2024, but the city's police department data shows it went down.",
    "story": [
      "When the Trump administration set up a federal task force to address crime in Memphis, Tennessee, last month, it cited crime data that didn't match statistics from the city's police department.",
      "While a White House press release from September says violent crime rose in Memphis in 2024, Memphis Police Department data shows violent crime went down.",
      "\"Murder is at a six-year low, aggravated assault is at a five-year low and sexual assault at a twenty-year low,\" the MPD said in a press release last month.",
      "Can both be true? Technically, yes.",
      "Same city, different statistics",
      "The White House drew on FBI \"Crime in the U.S.\" data that shows over 15,000 violent crimes in Memphis in 2024, thousands more than what the city reports in the same time period.",
      "Two factors help explain the difference: geography and how the crimes are counted.",
      "The FBI counts crimes across the nine-county metro area, spanning parts of Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas, where the population is more than twice that of Memphis. The Memphis Police Department only counts crimes within city limits.",
      "The second crucial factor is that the FBI counts each victim of violent crime, while Memphis police count each incident. One shooting that injures three people is recorded as three assaults in FBI data but only one in the city police data, which can make totals appear higher if the distinction isn't clear.",
      "\"Our political leaders need to be really careful on how they talk about crime. Do they talk about the definitions?\" said Dr. Thaddeus Johnson, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice. \"Some of that nuance was lost in that conversation and they put people on edge.\"",
      "How violent crime is defined",
      "Crime statistics also differ in part because there is no one definition of \"violent crime.\" Different law enforcement agencies will use subtly different definitions.",
      "As the FBI defines it, there are four core crime categories within violent crime: murder/nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.",
      "To count and publish crime data, until recently the FBI used a longstanding system called the Summary Reporting System, or SRS. The program counts the four violent crime categories and tallies each incident once, even if there are multiple victims.",
      "In 2021, the FBI switched to a new system called NIBRS, or the National Incident-Based Reporting System. It uses the same violent crime categories as SRS but counts each victim rather than each incident.",
      "\"NIBRS data is a massive improvement,\" Jacob Kaplan, professional specialist at the School of Public and International Affairs, said in his book \"Decoding FBI Crime Data,\" published earlier this year. \"It has led to an explosion of research that allows a far more detailed analysis of crime.\"",
      "Local police departments like Memphis generally use the FBI's definitions of violent crime when publishing stats online. However, Memphis includes all types of homicides and lists subcategories like non-fatal shootings.",
      "The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics adds \"simple assault\" to its violent crime statistics, which includes attacks where no weapon was used and did not result in serious injury. They also include crimes never reported to police, but reported in annual surveys conducted by the agency.",
      "With all these different definitions, one agency's crime statistics can show crime rising while another shows it falling.",
      "\"All of them tell pieces of the truth,\" said Johnson. \"Read the fine print. Most local websites have the methodology. And it tells you, are they counting by incidents or the number of victimizations?\"",
      "Johnson recommends a few key checks when looking at crime statistics, whether on your local police dashboard or while scrolling social media.",
      "Definitions: What crimes are included?What's being counted: Are totals based on incidents or the number of victims?\u00a0Time frame: Are figures year-to-date, a rolling 12-month average or a single month?Reporting gaps: Many crimes are never reported to the police.",

      "The appointment comes after several recent leadership changes at the IRS, with its most recent commissioner, former auctioneer and congressman Billy Long, stepping down in August after only two months on the job. Unlike previous IRS leaders, Long lacked a background in either accounting or tax law.",
      "Bisignano is a former Wall Street executive and CEO of Fiserv, a payments and financial services firm. In his role as IRS CEO, he'll report to Bessent, who will continue to serve as acting commissioner of the IRS, according to the Treasury Department.",

      "\"Never in Social Security's 90-year history has a commissioner held a second job,\" said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, in an email. \"Bisignano's new role will leave a leadership vacuum at the top of the agency, especially since the Republican Senate hasn't even confirmed a deputy commissioner.\"",

    "story": [
      "A new intelligence bulletin published by a non-profit security organization warns that extremist groups are increasingly using artificial intelligence to intensify antisemitic propaganda, recruitment and operations targeting Jewish communities across North America.",
      "The bulletin, authored by Secure Communities Network, an independent organization dedicated to safeguarding the Jewish community in North America, outlines how both foreign terrorist organizations and domestic violent extremists are exploiting AI tools \u2013 including chatbots, deepfake imagery and generative content \u2013 in order to automate and amplify disinformation, spread antisemitic narratives and spur the self-radicalization of lone actors.",
      "The bulletin notes that as \"AI-generated content begins to create increasingly higher-quality images, the line between real and fake blurs,\" making false antisemitic material appear more credible.",
      "In one cited incident in July 2025, the chatbot \"Grok,\" which was created by Elon Musk's xAI, posted antisemitic and extremist content, including praise for Hitler and references to neo-Nazi rhetoric, following a system update.",
      "According to the report, the posting began when an X user made a post \"celebrating\" the deaths of children and counselors from Camp Mystic following the floods in Texas Hill Country over the July 4 weekend. \"After Grok was tagged to respond to the post, it made a remark about the poster's surname and used the phrase 'every damn time,'\" according to the bulletin, \"which is frequently leveraged by neo-Nazis as a way of accusing Jewish people of persistently being the cause of negative aspects of one's life.\"",
      "The bulletin also cites examples of violent acts not directly tied to antisemitism that allegedly used artificial intelligence to assist in planning an explosion, illustrating how artificial intelligence can aid operational tactics. When a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, the report noted, Matthew Livelsberger allegedly used the AI chat bot ChatGPT to assist in gathering information about explosives and planning the attack.",
      "At the time, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, stated, \"This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\" later calling it, \"a concerning moment.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general of Virginia, faced condemnation from Republicans and Democrats on Friday after text messages from 2022 resurfaced in which he said he would \"piss on graves\" of GOP opponents and mused about hypothetically shooting then-Republican Speaker of the House of Delegates Todd Gilbert.",
      "In a text message exchange with Republican Delegate Carrie Coyner, Jones used violent and inflammatory language, writing that if he were presented with a hypothetical situation in which he had only two bullets and was faced with the choice of shooting Gilbert, former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler or former Cambodia dictator Pol Pot, he'd shoot Gilbert \"every time,\" prompting pushback from his former colleague.",
      "\"Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,\" Jones wrote. \"Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time.\"",
      "Gilbert could not be reached for comment.",
      "The content of the text messages was first reported by The National Review.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Jones said he took full responsibility for his actions.",
      "\"I want to issue my deepest apology to Speaker Gilbert and his family. Reading back those words made me sick to my stomach. I am embarrassed, ashamed, and sorry\u2026 I have reached out to Speaker Gilbert to apologize directly to him, his wife Jennifer, and their children. I cannot take back what I said; I can only take full accountability and offer my sincere apology,\" Jones said.",
      "Jones' opponent in the race, GOP incumbent Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, is calling attention to the Jones texts in a new campaign spot that ends with the message \"can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?\" It's an ad buy of $1.5 million that will be running statewide.",
      "Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial nominee, swiftly condemned Jones's comments.",
      "\"I spoke frankly with Jay about my disgust with what he had said and texted,\" Spanberger said Friday. \"What I have also made clear is that as a candidate \u2014 and as the next governor of our commonwealth \u2014 I will always condemn threatening language in our politics.\"",
      "Spanberger's Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, also denounced the remarks.",
      "\"This is horrible to read and should be wholly disqualifying of someone running for an office that protects the people of Virginia,\" Earle-Sears said in a statement. \"Jay Jones' horrific comments are a symptom of the entire Democratic Party, and his running mate, Abigail Spanberger, needs to call on him to drop out.\"",
      "Virginia has become a true battleground state in recent years. Democrats control the House of Delegates by three seats and the state Senate by two, but the Executive Mansion is occupied by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",
      "News of the messages reached the national level as well, with Vice President J.D. Vance calling for Jones to end his campaign.",
      "\"The Democrat candidate for AG in Virginia has been fantasizing about murdering his political opponents in private messages,\" he wrote in an X post. \"I'm sure the people hyperventilating about sombrero memes will join me in calling for this very deranged person to drop out of the race.\"",
      "On Sunday, President Trump called on Jones to drop out of the race immediately and offered his endorsement to Attorney General Jason Miyares.",

Even Democrats are saying it is 'RESIGNATION FROM CAMPAIGN' TERRITORY. Democrat Jay Jones should drop out of the Race, IMMEDIATELY, and the People of Virginia must continue to have a GREAT Attorney General in Jason Miyares who, by the way, has my Complete and Total Endorsement \u2014 JASON WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court convenes for a new term Monday and is set to hear cases ranging from the use of race in redistricting to Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is convening Monday for the start of its new term, with cases involving \"conversion therapy\" for minors, the use of race in redistricting, gun rights and state laws barring the participation of transgender athletes in girls' sports on the docket.",
      "But looming over the high court's newest term are legal battles involving President Trump's policies and efforts to reshape the executive branch \u2014 two will be decided by the Supreme Court in the coming months, though others could be poised for its intervention.",
      "The justices are returning to the bench following a summer recess marked by emergency appeals from the Trump administration on his immigration policies, efforts to cancel research grants, and mass layoffs of federal workers, among others. Mr. Trump has prevailed in most of his bids for emergency relief so far, but whether he will see similar success if the Supreme Court evaluates the merits of his plans remains to be seen.",
      "\"Most Americans aren't following the technicalities on the emergency docket, and so they just think the court is siding with the Trump administration every time,\" Allison Orr Larsen, a law professor at William & Mary, told CBS News. \"Once the cases are back up before the justices and decided on the merits, that's going to do a lot to either cement that assumption or upset that assumption.\"",
      "The president will see the first test of one of his policies on Nov. 5, when the Supreme Court considers the legality of his sweeping reciprocal tariffs, which are a centerpiece of his economic agenda. The high court is also set to decide whether Mr. Trump can fire without cause a Democratic-appointed member of the Federal Trade Commission. A decision in favor of the president in that case could invalidate removal protections enacted by Congress for a slew of independent agencies it sought to insulate from political pressure.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has also been asked to decide the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, though it'll be weeks before the high court decides whether to take up the issue.",
      "Roman Martinez, a lawyer at Latham & Watkins who frequently argues before the court, predicted that come next summer, \"the theme is going to be that the court had to confront an energetic executive, very expansive assertions of authority across this whole range of issues.\"",
      "The cases already set to be decided, coupled with those that are likely to be teed up for Supreme Court review, suggest that the term will be marked by disputes involving social issues and challenges to Mr. Trump's executive actions.",
      "\"The docket is already full of blockbuster cases, and that list is going to grow as challenges to the president's executive orders find their way back to the justices after having been dealt with on the emergency docket,\" Larsen said.",
      "Here are the major cases the Supreme Court will hear this term:",
      "\"Conversion therapy\" ban",
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Oct. 7 in a challenge to a Colorado law that bans \"conversion therapy\" for minors. Nearly half the states have similar laws in place.",
      "The law, which took effect in September 2019, prohibits \"conversion therapy\" for people under the age of 18. The state defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, a licensed counselor in Colorado who performs faith-informed counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body,\" according to court filings. But she fears that doing so will leave her in violation of Colorado's law and put her at risk of losing her license.",
      "Chiles sued the state and licensing officials in 2022, arguing that the ban violates her First Amendment rights by censoring her speech based on viewpoint and the content of her conversations. She sought to block Colorado from enforcing it against her.",
      "Colorado officials, meanwhile, argued that its law regulates professional health care treatment to ensure patients receive quality care. States have for centuries regulated professional health care to protect patients from substandard treatment, they said, and the First Amendment has never forbidden states from doing that.",
      "A federal district court ruled for Colorado, finding that its prohibition regulates professional conduct by forbidding certain speech made in a professional context. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision. The appeals court divided 2-1 in finding that the restriction regulates professional conduct that only incidentally burdens speech.",
      "The use of race in redistricting",
      "On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court will consider for the second time the Louisiana congressional map drawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "But the stakes for the case this time around are much higher: The justices are weighing whether the Constitution allows a state to intentionally create a second majority-minority congressional district to comply with the Voting Rights Act.",
      "\"The outcome of the case will not only determine the next steps for Louisiana's congressional map but may also shape the future of redistricting cases nationwide and forecast the resiliency of our nation's democratic values,\" Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, told reporters during a call.",
      "The long-running dispute involves the interplay between Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law. In this case, state lawmakers drew a second majority-Black congressional district to address a Section 2 violation, but bumped up against the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits racial gerrymandering.",
      "The case dates back to the first congressional map drawn by Louisiana Republicans and enacted in 2022, which consisted of one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts. African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "A district judge ruled that map likely violated Section 2 because it deprived minority voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate. So Louisiana state lawmakers went back to the drawing board and crafted a new map that contained a second majority-minority district.",
      "Republicans said the re-drawn districts brought the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act and protected key GOP incumbents in the U.S. House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee.",
      "But a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-Americans\" challenged that new map as a racial gerrymander in violation of the 14th Amendment, and a three-judge panel of district judges agreed. It found that race predominated in drawing the new voting boundaries.",
      "Last March, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether to keep Louisiana's re-crafted map in place. But in June, it ordered further arguments this term and later asked the parties \u2014 Louisiana officials, the 12 non-African-American voters, and a separate group of Black Louisianans \u2014 to address whether Louisiana's intentional creation of the second majority-minority House district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments.",
      "While Louisiana officials first defended the re-shaped House district lines, they now say the creation of the second majority-Black district in its new voting map violates the Constitution.",
      "The Supreme Court has typically given map-drawers breathing room to navigate the requirements of Section 2 and the 14th Amendment, but the Louisiana case could lead to a weakening of Section 2.",
      "In a 2023 decision that upheld the constitutionality of Section 2 as applied to redistricting, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that there should be an end to the drawing of voting boundaries based on race at some point. In a concurring opinion, he wrote \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\"",
      "Trump's sweeping tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump announced earlier this year that he would be imposing sweeping baseline tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, to address \"chronic trade deficits\" that he said \"are no longer merely an economic \u2014 they're a national emergency.\" He also imposed levies on products from Canada, Mexico and China because of what he said was their failure to stop illicit drugs from flowing into the U.S.",
      "The president used a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to implement the tariffs. That law gives the president the authority to declare a national emergency to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. Once the president declares a national emergency, IEEPA gives the president the authority to take certain actions, including to regulate importation.",
      "Mr. Trump declared national emergencies related to trade deficits and drug trafficking, and imposed the tariffs under IEEPA to address them.",
      "A group of 12 states and small businesses filed lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's tariffs, arguing that IEEPA did not give the president the authority to impose his global levies. A federal appeals court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that Mr. Trump's tariffs are illegal. A federal district court in Washington, D.C., also reached the same conclusion.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, and it agreed to hear the cases on an expedited basis.",
      "The high court has in the past been skeptical of broad presidential authority when it involves what are known in administrative law as \"major questions\" of vast economic and political significance, like when it invalidated former President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. But the Trump administration has argued that this delegation of power involves foreign affairs and national security, and his determination that tariffs are best suited to address trade-deficit and drug-trafficking emergencies warrant deference.",
      "Martinez predicted the debate in the case will be about textualism and how to look at the language in IEEPA, as well as principles like the major questions doctrine, deference and nondelegation that have been embraced by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "\"These are all the same kinds of arguments that the conservative side of the court has been pushing very strongly in recent years to limit the use and some would say abuse of executive branch authority,\" Martinez, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, said during an event hosted by Georgetown Law. \"It will be interesting to see how those same principles are applied in this context, where you have a Republican president with a major policy initiative.\"",
      "Campaign finance",
      "In a string of recent decisions, the Supreme Court has unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, which has allowed more money to flow into politics. The latest campaign finance dispute before the justices could follow that trend.",
      "At issue in the case is a 50-year-old provision of campaign finance law that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, two GOP campaign committees, along with then-Senate candidate JD Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, argued these limits were unconstitutional.",
      "A federal appeals court upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. But since that ruling 24 years ago, the makeup of the high court has changed significantly, and it now has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "Republicans appealed the lower court decision to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "State laws targeting transgender athletes",
      "On the heels of its June decision upholding a Tennessee law banning certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, the Supreme Court said it would decide whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The justices will be looking at laws from Idaho and West Virginia to determine whether they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and, in the case involving West Virginia, Title IX. Idaho was the first state to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, and roughly two dozen have enacted similar laws.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in February that aimed to keep transgender girls and women from competing on teams that match their gender identity.",
      "The Idaho case was brought by Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who attended Boise State University and wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore. She has been treated for gender dysphoria for several years, including receiving testosterone suppression and estrogen.",
      "A U.S. district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding the ban discriminates against transgender women. A federal appeals court upheld the injunction as applied to Hecox.",
      "Months after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, Hecox decided to dismiss her lawsuit for personal reasons and because of \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters.\" Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to toss out the appeals court's decision and order the case to be dismissed.",
      "The West Virginia case involves Becky Pepper-Jackson, who receives puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy and wanted to participate in girls' athletics in middle school. A federal judge initially blocked the state from enforcing the ban only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling it likely violates Title IX and the Constitution.",
      "But in 2023, the judge sided with the state and upheld the law, finding that the state can legislate sports rules because sex and the physical characteristics that flow from it are related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.",
      "A federal appeals court ruled in 2024, though, that the West Virginia law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.",
      "Trump's power to fire executive officers",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to overhaul the executive branch, including by firing Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies without cause. He has removed those officers despite federal laws shielding them from being terminated unless for inefficiency, malfeasance in office or neglect of duty.",
      "Lower courts have repeatedly sided with the fired officials and ordered them to be reinstated. But the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "After allowing those other firings, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether for-cause removal protections violate the separation of powers. It will also decide whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "\"These are cases that raise really profound questions about presidential power \u2026 about Congress' ability to design institutions of government and to insulate certain important functions from the political whims of the day, whether it be setting interest rates or deciding labor relations or nuclear safety,\" lawyer Deepak Gupta told reporters at the Georgetown Law event. Gupta represents Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired from her position as a member of the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "One of the disputes before the high court, which has not yet been scheduled for argument, involves Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who Mr. Trump removed from her post at the Federal Trade Commission. A district court ruled the president violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing a FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "When the case landed before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, it allowed Mr. Trump to oust Slaughter, and the high court said it would decide the constitutionality of removal protections for the FTC.",
      "The case puts in the Supreme Court's crosshairs a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to enact removal restrictions for officials at certain independent agencies, which the high court has chipped away at in recent years.",
      "The second case, involving Cook, will be argued in January. Mr. Trump attempted to fire Cook from the Fed board after an administration official accused her of mortgage fraud. The effort to remove her is unprecedented, as no president has attempted to fire a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any criminal offense. A federal judge ruled in September that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her termination.",
      "The judge also said Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before she was ousted.",
      "A federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to allow the president to fire Cook and agreed with the lower court that Cook did not receive adequate process before her attempted removal. The two-judge majority did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump asked the justices to let him remove Cook from the Fed Board while the challenge to her firing moved forward. But the high court declined to immediately rule on his request for relief, and instead said it will hear arguments in January.",
      "By putting off a decision, the Supreme Court let Cook remain a Fed governor while it considers the issue.",
      "Gun rights",
      "Just before the start of the new term, the Supreme Court said it will decide whether Hawaii can stop people with concealed-carry permits from bringing their handguns onto private property that is open to the public, unless they receive \"express authorization\" from the property owner.",
      "The case involves firearms restrictions enacted in Hawaii in 2023, on the heels of the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights. The measure prohibits people with concealed-carry permits from carrying handguns on different types of property, including beaches, playgrounds, bars and restaurants that serve liquor, and other \"sensitive\" locations.",
      "The restriction at issue in the case before the Supreme Court bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing handguns onto private property unless they receive permission from the property owner. Four other states \u2014 California, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York \u2014 have similar laws that require a property owner's approval before carrying firearms on private property, such as by posting signs stating that guns are allowed.",
      "The Hawaii Firearms Coalition and three gun owners with concealed-carry permits challenged the law in June 2023, and a federal appeals court ultimately upheld the provision related to private property.",
      "Lawyers for the gun owners argued that the 9th Circuit effectively found that the Second Amendment does not apply to private property open to the public, rendering \"illusory the right to carry in public.\" The Trump administration had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to take up the dispute, warning that because few property owners post signs allowing or prohibiting guns, Hawaii's restriction functioned as a \"near-complete ban on public carry.\"",
      "Hawaii officials, meanwhile, said the rule regarding private property \"represents a permissible effort to vindicate the rights of Hawaii's citizens.\" They argued that under its law, a person who wants to bring a gun into a store can simply ask for oral permission.",
      "Since its June 2022 decision recognizing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms extends to outside the home, the Supreme Court has been asked to decide the constitutionality of a number of longstanding firearms restrictions and state laws. Last year, the high court upheld a federal law prohibiting people subject to a domestic violence restraining order from having firearms.",
      "But it has also declined to take up challenges to state bans on assault weapons and other federal measures.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear a case brought by a licensed counselor in Colorado, who argues her state's ban on \"conversion therapy\" violates her First Amendment rights.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Tuesday to consider a legal battle involving a Colorado law banning \"conversion therapy\" treatment for minors brought by a licensed counselor in the state, which she argues unconstitutionally censors her conversations about gender dysphoria and sexuality with young clients.",
      "The plaintiff, Kaley Chiles, is a licensed counselor who performs \"faith-informed\" counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, says she seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\" But she fears that doing so will put her in violation of Colorado's law.",
      "\"They're peering into the counseling room and intruding on these private counseling conversations,\" Chiles told CBS News.",
      "Chiles' case is one of several raising hot-button issues that the Supreme Court will hear in its new term, which began Monday. In addition to weighing Colorado's ban, the high court will also consider state laws banning transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports, as well as a major voting rights dispute and where people with concealed-carry permits can bring handguns.",
      "Colorado is one of at least 20 states that prohibit mental health professionals from engaging in \"conversion therapy\" with minors. Colorado defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The law took effect in 2019, and in 2022, Chiles filed a lawsuit against Colorado and its licensing officials, arguing that the law violates her free speech rights by censoring her conversations based on viewpoint and the content of them. She sought a court order preventing Colorado from enforcing the ban against her.",
      "Colorado has not taken any disciplinary action against Chiles or any other licensed therapist for violating the ban, it said in court papers, and the state asserts that the talk therapy Chiles' aims to provide wouldn't defy its law because she expressly doesn't seek to change a patient's gender identity or sexual orientation.",
      "A federal district court allowed Chiles' suit to go forward but ruled against her, finding that Colorado's law regulates the professional conduct of mental health professionals, not speech. The court also found that the state has legitimate interests in protecting young people from what it says is a \"harmful and ineffective\" treatment.",
      "A divided federal appeals court upheld that decision, ruling that Colorado's law only prohibits a mental health professional from engaging in the practice of conversion therapy. The court said the measure is a regulation of professional conduct that incidentally burdens speech.",
      "In seeking the Supreme Court's review, Chiles argued that her speech is being chilled because she has been forced to turn away clients seeking counseling that explore sexuality and gender identity. She is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy group.",
      "\"In general, the adolescents who are reaching out, asking for therapy might have a variety of concerns and issues that counseling can be helpful with. Many people who are struggling with issues of sex and sexuality also have co-occurring disorders all the way from suicidality to any other mental health challenge like anxiety, depression, et cetera,\" Chiles said. \"When I'm having to turn them away, they don't get help that is helpful for any of those issues. They are just without a course to be able to offer true help to them from a professional.\"",
      "Chiles' lawyers have argued that Colorado's law prevents families and teens who want to address gender dysphoria by aligning identity and sex from working with a licensed counselor to help reach that goal. But under the measure, practices that provide assistance to patients undergoing gender transition are allowed, they said.",
      "\"It's not the government's role to peer into the counseling room and say some goals are permitted. Some goals are forbidden. Some speech is allowed. Some speech is forbidden,\" Jonathan Scruggs, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, said. \"In this country, we let the people decide what information they want. We don't let government bureaucrats decide. That's really the choice before the court.\"",
      "Chiles' lawyers also warned that if the law as applied to talk therapy is allowed, it could open the door to states imposing regulations on licensed professionals that could sweep up speech on all types of topics, like doctors discussing birth control or therapists encouraging divorce.",
      "\"Colorado's principle is really like a government censorship free-for-all,\" Scruggs said. \"Their theory is any time you have professionals giving advice, the government has total discretion to either ban or compel speech in that context. Would some states ban counselors from encouraging divorce? Or using contraception or the reverse?\"",
      "But Colorado officials said there is a long history of states regulating the health care profession to protect patients from substandard treatment, and the First Amendment has never barred states from doing that. Colorado pointed to medical malpractice laws and other licensing regimes, which lawyers said have long covered mental health and other treatments performed with words.",
      "\"This is because these words are used by a professional in a fiduciary relationship, to provide individualized treatment based on specialized knowledge, for the sole purpose of promoting the patient's health,\" officials wrote.",
      "Additionally, they have argued conversion therapy is ineffective and associated with depression, anxiety, loss of faith and suicidality, regardless of how it is performed. Major medical associations have warned that efforts to change a patient's sexual orientation or gender identity are potentially harmful to young people and not supported by credible scientific evidence.",
      "Colorado officials have also pushed back on Chiles' claim that it is trying to tamp down on certain speech \u2014 discouraging gender transition \u2014 that it disfavors.",
      "\"The only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor's sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\" they said in court papers.",
      "Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, said the law leaves room for legitimate therapy.",
      "\"What's prohibited by these laws is a very specific, very narrow set of practices, with the therapist trying to impose their own agenda on a minor patient, trying to seek a predetermined outcome,\" he said.",
      "Colorado lawyers and those backing the state warned that if Chiles' prevails, it would destabilize longstanding health care regulation and gut states' power to ensure mental health professionals adhere to the standard of care.",
      "\"If the court were to accept Chiles' argument that any time there's a professional regulation of medical care that applies to what a provider can and cannot say, that that's a free speech issue, that those laws are automatically subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment, that would be a very revolutionary, dramatic change in the current legal landscape. It would put countless other types of medical and mental health regulations into jeopardy,\" Minter said.",
      "Both sides have cited the Supreme Court's 2018 decision in a case involving a California law that required \"crisis pregnancy centers\" to provide certain notices to patients, which the high court found likely violated the First Amendment. In the majority opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court wrote \"speech is not unprotected merely because it is uttered by 'professionals,'\" and warned that regulating the content of professionals' speech risks suppression of unpopular ideas.",
      "The Trump administration is backing Chiles in the case, but told the Supreme Court in a filing that it should send the case back to lower courts for further proceedings. The Justice Department will participate in oral arguments Tuesday.",
      "\"Colorado is muzzling one side of an ongoing debate in the mental-health community about how to discuss questions of gender and sexuality with children,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing. \"Under the First Amendment, the State bears a heavy burden to justify that content-based restriction on protected speech.\"",
      "Federal appeals courts that have weighed state bans on conversion therapy have divided over their legality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit invalidated local restrictions in Florida in 2020, finding that \"the First Amendment has no carveout for controversial speech.\" But appeals courts in Philadelphia and San Francisco have upheld bans in New Jersey and Washington.",
      "The Supreme Court in 2023 turned away a challenge to Washington's law, leaving the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in place. Three justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, said they would have taken up the case.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Thomas wrote there is \"little question\" that Washington's law regulates speech and implicates the First Amendment. He argued that under the measure, licensed counselors can only convey a \"state-approved message of encouraging minors to explore their gender identities.\"",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in Chiles' case is expected by the end of June or early July.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amy-coney-barrett-harassment-death-threats-supreme-court-term-2025/",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:10:32 -0400",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said of the Supreme Court's emergency orders in the Trump cases, \"This isn't the final decision.\"",
    "story": [
      "Whenever Justice Amy Coney Barrett arrived at an auditorium or a library or a university last month to discuss her new book, she encountered a familiar sight: protesters.",
      "They lined the streets, chanting and carrying signs. One wore a handmaid's costume, a symbol of oppression. Another was dressed as liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death in 2020 created a vacancy on the Supreme Court that President Trump would fill with Barrett.",
      "For Barrett, protesters have become routine, another logistical wrinkle in her everyday life, much like the ones who regularly gather at her home outside Washington, D.C., where she lives with her husband and younger children. What surprises her, she told me in a wide-ranging interview in her chambers late last month, is how she can let it roll off her back.",
      "\"If I had imagined before I was on the Court, how I would react to knowing that I was being protested, that would have seemed like a big deal, like, 'oh, my gosh, I'm being protested,'\" she says. \"But now I have the ability to be like, 'Oh, okay, well, are the entrances blocked?' I just feel very businesslike about it. It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't disrupt my emotions.\"",
      "A fury of protests against conservative justices erupted in 2022, when news leaked that the Court was poised to overturn the landmark decision Roe v. Wade. Barrett, a conservative in the mold of her former mentor and boss Antonin Scalia, was a particular source of ire. Replacing Ginsburg, whose legal career was grounded in women's rights, she provided a key fifth vote to overturn Roe and let each state decide whether to allow abortion or not. But the decision also unleashed something much darker.",
      "On Friday, a California resident was sentenced to eight years in prison for the attempted assassination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who also voted to overturn Roe. Court papers revealed the perpetrator had also mapped out the homes of three other conservative justices, including Barrett's. Death threats have not gone away, and security remains high at their homes and whenever they appear in public.",
      "I asked Barrett if she is ever afraid. Her response was immediate and emphatic: \"I'm not afraid.\"",
      "\"You can't live your life in fear,\" she continued. \"And I think people who threaten \u2014 the goal is to cause fear. And I'm not afraid. I'm not going to reward threats with their intended reaction.\"",
      "That kind of mental discipline and self control, even in the face of threats and extreme criticism, reflects an outlook that has guided the 53-year-old Barrett much of her life.",
      "\"I don't make decisions emotionally. I try very hard not to let emotions guide decisions in any aspect of my life. The way that I respond to people, the choices that we make,\" she continues, adding with a laugh, \"apart from maybe some impulse buys of clothes or something.\"",
      "That outlook is also reflected in her approach to the law.",
      "On the Supreme Court, Barrett's opinions are highly analytical. She doesn't like to decide more than the issue at hand, which is one reason she has parted ways with conservative colleagues who would rather swing for the fences, like in a case two terms ago when the Court ruled states cannot remove Mr. Trump from the ballot. Barrett agreed on the bottom line, but had a more limited approach.",
      "As a former law professor, she can be formalistic and technical, qualities that also can separate her from other conservatives, as in a 2024 case that attempted to hold the Biden administration responsible for suppressing speech on social media during Covid.",
      "Now entering her sixth year on the Court, Barrett continues to defy stereotypes. Critics span the political spectrum, not only Democrats after she voted to overturn Roe, but more recently Republicans in the wake of decisions at odds with Mr. Trump. She is \"confounding the Right and the Left,\" as the New York Times put it, raising hopes and fears on both sides.",
      "That's partly because, in decades past, some conservative justices have turned out to be anything but conservative. Would Barrett, too, go that route? And it's also in part because of a fundamental misunderstanding about the Court, reflecting an idea that the justices are mere political actors who should stay on their respective sides, regardless of the law.",
      "\"That is a notion that I try to disabuse people of in the book,\" she says.",
      "Correcting some of those public misperceptions that the Supreme Court is driven by politics or outcomes or is loyal to Mr. Trump is one of her main goals with her new book, \"Listening to the Law.\" She is part teacher, part tour guide, taking the reader inside the Court and highlighting some of its most controversial decisions to explain how the justices interpret the Constitution and the differences in conservative and liberal philosophies.",
      "And there is no case more controversial than the 5-4 decision overturning Roe, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Whole Health. Barrett uses it to explain how she and the Court's conservative majority interpret the Constitution with a method known as \"originalism,\" focusing on the Constitution's original meaning, the way the public understood it when it was adopted.",
      "In our interview, Barrett said she was drawn to originalism when she read Justice Scalia's opinions in a constitutional law class during her second year at Notre Dame Law School. She said she was frustrated after a first-year criminal law class, reading liberal decisions of the Warren Court and finding them to be \"unmoored.\" Scalia's opinions, with his originalist framework, made sense to her.",
      "\"I think I am different in style than Justice Scalia. I don't think I'm different in substance,\" she said. \"I think one thing that was important to Justice Scalia is fidelity to his analytical framework, so fidelity to textualism and originalism, even when it led to places that he didn't want to go.\"",
      "Scalia, for example, upheld flag burning as a First Amendment right, even though he said \"if I were king, I would not.\" With Barrett, an example is the death penalty. She upholds it as constitutional, even though it is at odds with her religious views.",
      "And that framework, she says, is how she approaches the cases involving Mr. Trump. While politicians, the media and the public are focused on the current occupant of the office, she says \"the Court has to take the long view.\"",
      "\"The way that we have to view cases is about the presidency, not about the president. We have to make a decision that's going to apply to six presidents from now, and that's how I try to view the law,\" she says. \"So in the same way that I do try to erase particular policies, or substitute in ones that I like or dislike \u2014 to try to maintain neutrality \u2014 I try to do that with the presidents too, because it can't turn on the president.\"",
      "Her critics aren't convinced, but Barrett seems unfazed by the attacks on her judgment or her character. In our conversation, and in multiple interviews with those who know her, she comes across as someone with a strong sense of self and an equally clear view on the right way to interpret the Constitution. Unlike some justices, she says she doesn't monitor what journalists and law professors and politicians say about the Court. She has seen them get it wrong. It doesn't matter to her.",
      "\"If I could have, especially as a 16-year-old, imagined that I would not care or be impervious to being criticized and mocked, I would have been very surprised,\" she says. \"And so I am glad, because I think this would be a miserable job if you let yourself care, if you let yourself be affected.\"",
      "Barrett first walked through the fire after Mr. Trump nominated her in 2017 to the Chicago-based federal appeals court. In her Senate hearings, she withstood withering attacks on her faith, notably when then-Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told her, \"the dogma lives loudly within you.\" Her steely performance impressed conservatives and helped get her on Mr. Trump's Supreme Court shortlist.",
      "Barrett was astonished by how she was portrayed by the media. (She said a cousin told her \"the person they were describing is not the person that I've known my whole life at all.\")",
      "A mother of seven, Barrett is a devout Catholic and proud daughter from a large and supportive family with deep roots in New Orleans. Before becoming an appeals court judge, she was a popular and respected Notre Dame law professor with sparkling credentials. Always a high achiever, she had received full scholarships to college and law school at Notre Dame, where she was top in her class (and met her future husband) and earned highly competitive clerkships with towering conservative icons, Judge Laurence Silberman and Scalia.",
      "\"One thing that I really disliked was this idea that I had no backbone, or that I was just this subservient woman in some way,\" she said, \"because I felt like I am anything but that.\"",
      "She had set goals for her life early on, and she made conscious and methodical choices to reach them. She wanted a big family like she grew up with, but, of course, she would work, so she wanted flexibility in her career.",
      "\"I really admired my parents, I really admired my grandparents, and I thought, if I want to be the kind of people that they are, I have to make definite choices,\" she told me. \"I have to decide what my values are, what my priorities are, and make definite choices and prioritize those kinds of things.\"",
      "Thinking about law school after college, she says she remembers sitting in her dorm room at Rhodes College and making a list of pros and cons, focusing on what mattered to her and \"I just reasoned my way to it.\" (Barrett, always analytical, mentions in her book that her life runs on to-do lists, but she also is partial to pro/con lists.)",
      "She's now the only justice on the Court who didn't attend an Ivy League school, but Barrett says she didn't care about labels or what was considered \"the best school.\" She didn't even apply to Harvard. She opted for Notre Dame over the University of Chicago, for instance, not only because she could prioritize her Catholic faith, but that it also offered a full scholarship. That meant no big student loans that would force her into an all-consuming, high-paying law firm job after graduation.",
      "Searching for a more accurate way to describe herself, Barrett uses the term \"Steel Magnolia.\"",
      "\"I've done a lot of traditionally feminine things. I have a large family. I've made unconventional choices in that way. And I'm not sorry to be feminine,\" she said. \"But I don't feel like I have to sacrifice that part. I think you can be traditional in some of those ways, and still have grit or the backbone or the spine. I felt like I had the grit.\"",
      "\"Grit\" is a word she uses more than once in the book when talking about strong women she admires, like her great-grandmother, a widow who raised 13 children in a tiny house \"bursting at the seams\" during the Great Depression. \"Somehow she always managed to find the resources, space and time,\" Barrett writes.",
      "Throughout our conversation, I'm struck by something she wrote early in the book, when she mentions advice her father gave to her and her siblings: \"Control your emotions, or your emotions will control you.\"",
      "It's similar to advice Justice Ginsburg liked to share from her mother: \"Don't be distracted by emotions like anger, envy, resentment. These just zap energy and waste time.\" Ginsburg would say her advice came in handy at the Court, because she learned that reacting with \"anger or annoyance will not advance one's ability to persuade.\"",
      "I asked Barrett if she, like Ginsburg, drew on that advice at the Court.",
      "\"Yes, in this job, I think it's part of the tuning out, that I can't let what people say\u2026certainly not affect the decisions that I make, but even affect how I feel,\" she says. \"If I let that in, and then let that affect my mood when I go home or when I'm relating to people, then that needs to be kept out.\"",
      "Having that mindset, Barrett says, is one of the things she's most proud of as justice, because that wasn't how she felt as a young teenager growing up in a family of nine.",
      "\"I felt very conspicuous. We would go into restaurants, and you could see people turning around and counting and looking,\" she says. \"In the preteen and teenage self-conscious years, I thought, I just want to be unnoticed. I'm never gonna have a family that attracts attention.\"",
      "Barrett rarely shows the kind of rhetorical fire or hyperbole some of her colleagues regularly exhibit. Stylistically, as she says, she is no Scalia. But with the Court increasingly under strain as it grapples with dozens of emergency requests from the Trump administration, Barrett exhibited a flash of pique last term, responding to a fiery dissent by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in the case limiting the use of nationwide injunctions.",
      "Jackson, a Biden appointee and the Court's newest member, accused the Court of engaging in \"legalese.\" Barrett, speaking for the majority, responded: \"We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries with of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself.\"",
      "In the months since, Jackson has only ratcheted up her rhetoric as the Court has issued temporary orders in a range of cases brought by the Trump administration. In one emergency order last month, on whether Mr. Trump could cancel grants to the National Institutes of Health, Jackson impugned the conservatives' motives.",
      "Jackson accused them of having \"no fixed rules\" except \"this Administration always wins\" something Barrett pointed out in an event last month was obviously false. (Just one high-profile example: The Court ruled against the Administration's deportation of Kilmar Albrego Garcia and ordered it to work toward his return to the U.S.)",
      "Still, Barrett insists that kind of language doesn't affect her relationship with Jackson, and that she works to have relationships with all the other justices. She says she enjoys talking about the law with Justice Elena Kagan, also a former law professor who, like Barrett has a more formalistic approach to the law than the Court's two other liberals, even though it leads them to very different places.",
      "In a recent interview, Bari Weiss of The Free Press asked Barrett to give one word for each of her colleagues. For Kagan, Barrett chose \"analytical.\" That's a word she also used in our conversation to describe herself.",
      "\"You can't take it personally, and so I think you just have to understand and see opinions for what they are: disagreements about ideas,\" Barrett said of the dissents. \"I intend my opinions to be about the ideas, not about the people, and I think a big part of life is assuming the best of other people.\"",
      "Barrett doesn't seem like a person who dwells in regret. But she said she saw a \"missed opportunity\" on her cross-country book tour, and she wished she'd emphasized how the emergency orders in the Trump cases are different. Always a teacher, she wants to explain these orders aren't the last word.",
      "\"I don't think the public is really aware this isn't the final decision. If a district court enters a preliminary injunction, and we enter a stay of that preliminary injunction, it's not saying the administration wins,\" she says. \"It's simply saying that the administration\u2026can continue to pursue whatever policy it is, because it has not been finally decided yet.\"",
      "In other words, she says, these interim orders \u2014 whether they're allowing Mr. Trump to cut grants or foreign aid or fire political appointees from federal agencies \u2014 are short-term, preliminary decisions. The Court is allowing Mr. Trump to pursue those policies for now, but if he ultimately loses on the underlying merits, the aid money will have to be spent and the employees reinstated with back pay.",
      "And Mr. Trump, I said, may not win them all?",
      "\"Right,\" Barrett said.",
      "It may look different, I asked, once you're deciding the merits?",
      "\"100 percent,\" she said.",
      "For now, one factor weighing in Mr. Trump's favor is the Court's assessment of the harm caused when unelected judges reflexively block policies enacted by popularly elected representatives. Because litigation can take years to resolve, those policies may never end up taking effect. The harm caused by judicial interference, the Court has explained, is to the democratic process.",
      "\"The case that we always cite is Maryland v. King, and it points out that any time a policy of one of the politically accountable branches or politically accountable state legislatures or governor is stopped, that, in itself, is an irreparable harm because you are affecting the people,\" she says. \"It was the people's preferred policy. The president is the one that they elected. The members of whatever legislature, state or Congress, are the ones that people elected.\"",
      "\"I may disagree, or agree, with whatever choices the people have made in the selection of their representatives,\" she said. \"But the people have made this choice.\"",
      "Beyond the obvious strain on the Court, the unprecedented crush of emergency appeals also has put pressure on lower court judges, and some have complained publicly that the Court's brief orders aren't giving them enough guidance. But Barrett, always methodical, says more guidance at the preliminary stage would come at a cost, raising the risk of locking the Court into its views before it has fully considered the issues.",
      "\"I do think opinions are important,\" she says. \"I don't know that it's always valuable to have an interim opinion that comes before the final opinion.\"",
      "Barrett, like all the justices when speaking in public, is exceedingly careful with her words. She won't discuss any upcoming issues or cases, or give any hint on how the Court may see the underlying merits. Even her book tour seemed like an exercise in not making news, and she succeeded.",
      "But she will have that opportunity soon enough: The justices already have agreed to decide whether Mr. Trump can impose far-ranging tariffs and fire members of certain federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board. In the interim, it's allowing him to pursue tariffs and fire some Biden-appointed commissioners, though not on the Fed. Other cases, including birthright citizenship, are on the horizon.",
      "Beyond the Trump cases, the Court this term also will confront controversial cases on gun rights, voting rights, campaign finance reform and whether students who identify as transgender can play girls sports. The tensions and commentary will not ease anytime soon.",
      "For Barrett, that means staying the course, following her own internal compass and tuning out the noise, because one thing is certain. Whatever the Court decides in any of the cases, she says, \"somebody's going to be mad.\" It's a part of her life now.",
      "\"I just think you have to know who you are,\" she says, \"and make decisions that you decide are right, and stick with your priorities and not worry about the feedback you get from others, whether it's negative or whether it's positive.\"",

These first drafts honoring America's 250th Birthday and @POTUS are real,\" U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach\u00a0wrote\u00a0in a social media post on Friday, which included drawings of the coin. \"Looking forward to sharing more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over.\"",
      "The obverse, or heads, side of the coin features Mr. Trump's profile, while the tails side depicts the president with his fist raised and a U.S. flag flying behind him, which is reminiscent of the photo taken after a\u00a0failed assassination attempt\u00a0on the president in Pennsylvania last year. The tails side also has the words \"fight fight fight\" emblazoned over Mr. Trump's image.",

      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-2025-does-congress-get-paid/",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 09:33:31 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday morning after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",

    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "summary": "Americans are concerned about the effect of the shutdown on the economy, amid unease about jobs and inflation.",
    "story": [
      "For many Americans, across party lines, concern over the government shutdown means concern about its potential impact on the economy, among other things.",
      "Therefore, many don't think either party's position is worth having a shutdown over.",
      "Given that, no one is looking especially good politically at the moment. President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans are all net negative on their handling of the shutdown thus far.",
      "Neither party is on very solid footing. The top descriptor Americans pick for the Democratic Party overall is \"weak;\" the party trails the GOP on being described as \"effective\" and \"strong,\" and their favorables trail the GOP's. The top descriptor for Republicans, though, is \"extreme.\"",
      "All of it looks to the public like another distraction from larger matters of concern. A sizable majority of the country says the Trump administration isn't focused enough on lowering prices, and is focused too much on tariffs, as they have been for months. Reflecting some of that, many still describe the president himself as \"energetic,\" but fewer describe him now as \"focused\" than did at the start of his term.",
      "Relatively few Americans say the Democrats' or Republicans' positions are worth a shutdown. As it is still fairly recent, many aren't sure yet.",
      "For the Democrats, only half their rank and file think their party's positions are worth a shutdown, and even fewer Republicans say that of the GOP's positions. That said, they don't blame their respective parties for the situation, either.",
      "There's plenty of that blame to go around. Republicans and the president get relatively more than congressional Democrats, but taken together with Americans who blame both equally, a majority of the country holds all of them responsible.",
      "When asked what the shutdown debate is mainly about, health care is the top response from a list of issues, and those following the matter more closely pick that more often. That may speak to the parties' respective arguments getting at least to their bases.",
      "The percentage very concerned about the impact on the economy is higher than for other items.",
      "People also express concern, to a lesser degree, about the effects of the shutdown on federal employees. Also, the military, transportation and air travel, and Social Security and Medicare, which, even if they are not directly part of the negotiations, likely show that people tend to associate these programs with the government, generally.",
      "Still, overall views and descriptors of the parties aren't positive ones. Each has underwater favorability ratings overall, with the Republicans getting slightly better ratings than the Democrats.",
      "From a list of descriptors of the parties, it's a case of weak (the way most of the nation describes the Democratic Party) versus extreme (the most often-picked label for the GOP).",
      "The Republican Party greatly outpaces the Democrats on being called \"effective\" and \"strong.\"",
      "Over four in 10 rank-and-file Democrats describe their own party as weak.",
      "The economy and the president",
      "Against the backdrop of the shutdown, and helping explain why so many are concerned about its economic impact, inflation and the economy continue to be seen as the nation's top issues. And as has been the case for a while, a large majority says the Trump administration isn't focused enough on lowering prices. And most continue to say it is focused too much on tariffs.",
      "And most say Trump's policies are costing jobs in the U.S., rather than creating jobs.",
      "That's combined with Americans' view that Trump's policies aren't making them better off and are still making prices go up. On balance, the president's handling of inflation, specifically, has ticked down again.",
      "Fewer Americans now describe the president as \"focused\" than did at the start of his second term. His top descriptors remain \"tough\" and \"energetic,\" but the percentage who call him \"effective\" is also down compared to February.",
      "More broadly \u2014 and not specifically related to the shutdown, but perhaps pertinent given that situation \u2014 Americans still say it's Congress, not the president, who should have the most authority over federal spending. That's a view held by majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans.",
      "Donald Trump's overall approval rating, at 42%, is now back down to what it was in July, after hitting 44% last month. He remains bolstered by support from his Republican base, and still gets better marks on his deportation program and immigration than on inflation and the economy overall.",
      "At 43%, the president's approval rating on handling the conflict between Israel and Hamas is similar to what it was this summer, and higher than his approval ratings on economic issues. (This polling was conducted before reports of a possible ceasefire deal.)",
      "Troops and U.S. cities",
      "The idea of troops going to U.S. cities remains divisive. It's backed staunchly by the president's Republican base, especially those who identify as MAGA, but finds far less backing beyond it.",
      "Whether it's the National Guard specifically or active-duty military troops going to cities, views are similar. Much of it, beyond the partisan breaks, is tied to where one sees threats to the U.S. originating.",
      "Those who support troops in cities tend to see threats from inside the country, subscribing to some of the arguments made by the administration, that threats are coming from domestic enemies.",
      "But for the majority of Americans who see dangers more from economic forces, or who feel the U.S. military's overall focus ought to be outside the U.S., it is much less so.",
      "For decades now, a majority of Americans have backed having women who serve in the military participating in combat roles, and that continues to be the case today, at three-quarters, a view shared equally by men and women. The quarter of Americans who do not think women in the military should participate in combat roles tend to be more conservative.",

      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",

      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee.",

    "summary": "Enceladus has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.",
    "story": [
      "The ocean hidden under the icy shell of Saturn's moon Enceladus harbors complex organic molecules, a study said Wednesday, offering further evidence that the small world could have all the right ingredients to host extraterrestrial life.",
      "Just 310 miles wide and invisible to the naked eye, the white, scar-covered Enceladus is one of hundreds of moons orbiting the sixth planet from the sun.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the sun \u2014 and therefore too cold \u2014 to be habitable.",
      "Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon's miles-thick layer of ice.",
      "Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide and phosphorus.",
      "When the spacecraft passed over the moon's south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.",
      "These jets were propelling tiny ice particles \u2014 smaller than grains of sand \u2014 into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon's surface, others collected around one of Saturn's many rings.",
      "When Cassini flew through Saturn's outermost \"E\" ring, it was \"detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,\" Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space agency.",
      "\"There are many possible pathways from the organic molecules we found in the Cassini data to potentially biologically relevant compounds, which enhances the likelihood that the moon is habitable,\" Nozair said.",
      "By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules \u2014 including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.",
      "But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years \u2014 or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.",
      "So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.",
      "Luckily, they already had access to some.",
      "When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon's surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft's Cosmic Dust Analyzer at around 11 miles a second.",
      "But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\"Being habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Having a variety of organic compounds on an extraterrestrial water world is simply phenomenal,\" Klenner told the AP in an email.",
      "\"Another piece of the puzzle\"",
      "Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that \"the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn's E ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus's ocean.\"",
      "French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was \"not much doubt\" that these molecules were in the moon's ocean.",
      "But this confirmation provides \"another piece in the puzzle,\" she added.",
      "It also shows that recent technology such as artificial intelligence allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.",
      "But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.",
      "The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.",
      "After all, \"Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,\" the agency said in the statement.",
      "Khawaja added that \"even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.\"",
      "NASA has a spacecraft en route to another enticing target to hunt for the ingredients of life: Jupiter's moon Europa. The Europa Clipper is expected to begin orbiting Jupiter in 2030 with dozens of Europa flybys. ESA also has a spacecraft, Juice, that's headed to Jupiter to explore Europa and two other icy moons that could hold buried oceans.",

      "\"The United States would cede leadership to other countries, especially [the] China National Space Administration,\" if funding to NASA Science is cut, Nye said. In an interview on \"The Takeout\" following the protest, Nye argued NASA's budget is just \"a sliver of the pie\" of the nearly $1.7 trillion federal budget.",
      "\"It's barely the width of the pie cutter, it's less than 0.1% of the federal budget and the return is extraordinary,\" he told CBS News' Major Garrett.",
      "A White House budget proposal\u00a0issued\u00a0earlier this year would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18.8 billion.",
      "Nye, the CEO of Planetary Society and former host of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy,\" and around 300 space advocates said Monday\u00a0that dozens of missions would be at risk \u2014 including NASA's Perseverance Mars rover and the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century \u2014 if the cuts are approved by Congress.",
      "Despite the proposed cuts, NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, said last month as he introduced a new class of 10 NASA astronaut candidates that there's a possibility one of them could be among the first Americans to put their boots on Mars. However, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade, and probably longer.",
      "Duffy also said he was confident the U.S. would beat China and win the second space race back to the moon.",
      "Referring to the recent news of Mars rover Perseverance uncovering\u00a0rocks that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, Nye said a NASA budget cut would put the U.S. behind as China plans to launch its sample-return mission in 2028, possibly bringing back samples in 2033.",
      "\"Everybody, understand that if we were to find evidence of life on another world, it would change the course of human history,\" he added. \"So you say, 'Well, how much does that cost?' We're not sure. We've never done it.\"",
      "The 69-year-old science advocate said investing in NASA is \"priceless,\" telling Garrett: \"NASA also, objectively, every dollar that goes into NASA Science comes back at least a factor of three times, so if you put $1 into NASA Science, you're going to get $3 back into the economy.\"",

    "story": [
      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee.",

      "\"I've flown safety chase on it for several missions, messaging back and forth with the autonomy on board,\" said McMullen.",
      "Maneuvering alongside an AI-piloted drone, he said, takes a bit of getting used to: \"As humans, we fly very smooth, but it can roll and fly a little bit snappier than maybe a human pilot would,\" McMullen acknowledged. \"It could be a little bit rougher a ride, but there's no human on board.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is on board, and now it is learning how to fight.",
      "McMullen said the tasks assigned to AI might be to intercept an adversary aircraft: \"So, we've been able to give it some of the basic blocking and tackling of air combat that we as human pilots also train on when we're first learning how to fly,\" he said.",
      "The XQ-58 blasts off like a rocket, but a full-scale model took off from a runway for the first time in August.",
      "General Adrian Spain, head of Air Combat Command, is drawing up plans for operating AI-piloted drones alongside manned aircraft. \"You've told them to go out in front and to execute an attack on a complex set of targets, and they will do that,\" Spain said.",

      "An AI-piloted F-16 has already held its own in a limited dogfight against an experienced fighter pilot. At Top Gun AI, other F-16s are being rewired for more realistic combat.

      "\"Yep, they'll be monitoring the system and ready to take over at a moment's notice,\" McMullen said. \"But we'll also have real live aircraft out there for it to fight against. Those jets will be piloted by real fighter pilots trying their best to outsmart the AI.\"",
      "So, are we witnessing a revolution?",
      "\"If we continue down this path, it has the potential to be a revolution,\" said Spain.",
      "\"You actually can take more risk\"",
      "Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Clint Hinote says it is a revolution born of necessity: \"The Air Force was so good for so long that it didn't need to change. Now it needs to change, and it's trying to figure out how.\"",
      "Change because the Chinese air force, which recently \u00a0showcased its newest jet fighters and its own AI drone, could be more than a match for the U.S. Air Force. According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"",
      "\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"",
      "The Air Force is counting on AI drones to even the odds, by bringing to an aircraft what a human pilot doesn't. McMullen said, \"The big thing with artificial intelligence is the ability to handle large amounts of data. A human out in a complex air combat environment, there's just no way to absorb all of it. Artificial intelligence might be able to take all of the data information, and then process that very quickly, and then make real-time decisions.\"",
      "AI drones will be about half the length of a manned jet fighter, and one-quarter the cost \u2013 $20 to 30 million each. Hinote said, \"You could buy more airplanes, put them in the field, and still not break the bank. The key would be that you don't have to bring the human operator home; you actually can take more risk.\"",
      "Spain says the Air Force expects to have 150 AI-piloted aircraft by the end of the decade, and eventually up to 1,000.",
      "I asked, \"These drones aren't just going to sit in a hangar waiting for war with China. What are they going to do in peacetime?\"",
      "\"It's pretty wide open,\" Spain replied.",
      "\"Could you send up AI drones to intercept those Russian bombers that come down off the coast of Alaska?\"",
      "\"Yes, you could do that,\" he said.",
      "Those intercepts can turn nasty in an instant. Last year a Russian fighter rocked an American F-16, so AI drones would have to be prepared to shoot.",
      "So, is AI going to be making life-or-death decisions? \"Absolutely not,\" said Spain. \"Absolutely not. The human who's controlling the AI will make the life-and-death decisions.\"",
      "At least for now.",
      "Making life-or-death decisions",
      "Hinote said, \"Increasingly militaries around the world, including the United States military, are going to be pressured to give the machines more leeway in making those life-or-death decisions.\"",
      "Including the capability to fire on their own? \"The United States military is investing in the experimentation that you would need to be able to produce the types of platforms that could fire on their own if you gave them that option,\" Hinote said.",
      "If adversaries let AI make those decisions, what happens? \"I think they do so at their own peril,\" said Spain. \"Because the AI can be fooled, the AI can be overwhelmed. It can give you false outcomes. We've seen that AI can hallucinate. So, it's not a guarantee of success. What it guarantees is that it will do something quickly.\"",
      "\"Don't you at least have to give your pilots that option?\" I asked.",
      "\"To go full autonomy and just let it go? I don't think America is comfortable with that yet,\" Spain replied. \"I'm not saying that couldn't be a future world that we live in where we trust it. But I don't think we're there right now, certainly, and certainly not to start. We have to build that trust over time.\"",
      "At Top Gun AI, pilots keep putting in the reps, test flight after test flight, simulation after simulation, to build that trust.",

    "summary": "The developer of the ICEBlock app said the software has been removed from Apple's App Store due to \"objectionable content.\"",
    "story": [
      "Apple has removed an app used to track Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from its App Store, with the developer saying in a social media post that it had been told by the technology company that its ICEBlock app had been removed due to \"objectionable content.\"",
      "The app, which is free, relies on crowdsourcing to track ICE agents, with the company noting that it allows people to report sightings of ICE activities \"within a 5 mile radius of your current location.\" The app crossed 1 million downloads a month ago, the developer said. In its social media post, the ICEBlock developer blamed \"pressure from the Trump Admin.\" for the decision.",
      "\"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.\"",
      "In a comment to CBS News, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said the Department of Justice had asked Apple to remove the app.",
      "\"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store \u2014 and Apple did so,\" Bondi said. \"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed. This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.\"",
      "ICEBlock is one of a number of apps designed to let users track and anonymously report immigration agents. Another such tool, called Coqui, was still available on the App Store as of Friday morning. Some migrants are relying on the apps to alert them to the location of ICE agents to avoid arrest amid the Trump administration's ramp up of deportation activities.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, told CBS News that apps that track ICE agents \"put the lives of the men and women of law enforcement in danger as they go after terrorists, vicious gangs and violent criminal rings.\"",
      "She added, \"But, of course, the media spins this correct decision for Apple to remove these apps as them caving to pressure instead of preventing further bloodshed and stopping law enforcement from getting killed.\"",
      "In July, ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan told CBS News she thinks such apps are dangerous and could be used to spot and ambush ICE agents.",
      "\"There's always a form of free speech and a lot of things in technology, and we understand that and respect that, but where it crosses a line is when it becomes dangerous, not only to the ICE officers ...,\" Sheahan said at the time. She added, \"If it's impeding in law enforcement effort, that's where that line comes in as well.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 17:54:48 -0400",
    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-artificial-intelligence-work-trade-jobs/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:28:17 -0400",
    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "story": [
      "As Illinois and Chicago filed suit to block the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, a judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order Monday afternoon, and it was revealed that troops are already on their way.",
      "\"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president's favor,\" the lawsuit states in its introduction.",
      "In the lawsuit, which names both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago as plaintiffs, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul writes, \"Defendants' deployment of federalized troops to Illinois is patently unlawful.\" He continues, \"Plaintiffs ask this court to halt the illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional federalization of members of the National Guard of the United States, including both the Illinois and Texas National Guard.\"",
      "Raoul is asking for a temporary restraining order, saying deployment will cause \"additional unrest,\" \"mistrust of police,\" and harm to the state's economy.",
      "In court, defense attorneys in this case were asked a series of logistical questions, like what cities in Illinois the National Guard would be deployed and they couldn't provide the answers.",
      "The judge said that while she was troubled by the lack of information and details of the operation, she will give those attorneys a couple more days to respond. She did caution lawyers for the Trump administration, \"If I were the federal government, I'd take a pause on this.\"",
      "The judge did not issue a restraining order during Monday's status hearing, instead setting another hearing for arguments on Thursday.",
      "However, it was revealed in court that National Guard troops from Texas are already on their way to Illinois and could be deployed as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday. The Illinois National Guard was ordered to report on Tuesday for training, according to state attorneys.",
      "In a Monday afternoon news conference, Pritzker repeatedly decried what he called the Trump administration's \"unconstitutional invasion\" of Chicago, and said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials are expanding raids and military-style enforcement actions in order to sow chaos that would then justify the deployment of military troops to Chicago.",
      "\"The state of Illinois is going to use every lever at our disposal to resist this power grab and get Noem's thugs the hell out of Chicago,\" Pritzker said. \"I am not afraid. I am not\u00a0afraid. And I will not back down.\"",
      "\"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military,\" said AG Raoul. \"Particularly for the reason that their city or state leadership have fallen out of the president's political favor.\"",
      "Raoul said the state has filed more than 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration so far. He cited the militia clauses of the U.S. Constitution, which give Congress the sole authority to decide where troops are deployed, and the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits military troops from participating in civilian law enforcement.",
      "\"It is unfair to National Guardsmen, it is unfair to local law enforcement, and it is certainly unfair to the law-abiding citizens of Illinois who do not want to be subject to military occupation,\" Raul said.",
      "Raoul said the only situation in the city or state that is \"out of control\" are the ICE agent,s whose overreach he said creates pretext for military deployment, and cited President Trump's own statements that he wants to use American cities as military training grounds and said Chicago \"is about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\"",
      "\"I'm here to say that the president's actions are illegal,\" Raoul said. \"The president has failed to establish that any of the legal prerequisites exist for his efforts to mobilize his National Guard troops here.\"",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson said the lawsuit sends \"a message to the president that Chicago will not be used as a political prop. Chicago will not be intimidated and will not be silent.\"",
      "\"Our city has faced tough times before, and every time we stood strong, because we stood together,\" Johnson said. \"Let's continue to work together to protect our democracy and fight for the future of our country.\"",
      "U.S. Senators for Illinois Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth released a statement in conjunction with other Illinois Democrats, demanding Mr. Trump reverse his decision to deploy National Guard troops.",
      "\"We write to urge you to reverse your reckless decision to federalize and deploy Texas and Illinois National Guard troops to Illinois.\u00a0 Your use of the military to sow fear and chaos in American cities, including over the objections of several Governors, is unconstitutional and un-American, infringes on individual and states' rights, and threatens to undermine military readiness and morale,\" wrote the lawmakers in part.",
      "Over the weekend, a\u00a0federal memo obtained by CBS News\u00a0revealed up to 300 members of the Illinois National Guard would be federalized and deployed to \"protect federal property\" and \"government personnel performing federal functions.\"",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyers want the hip-hop mogul sent to a low-security federal prison in New Jersey to serve his four-year, two-month prison sentence, telling a judge Monday that the facility's drug treatment program will help him stay clean.",
      "In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs \"to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos wrote. He also cited educational and occupational programs available at the prison, located about 70 miles south of New York City.",
      "The request from Combs' attorney came after Subramanian asked his lawyers on Friday at the sentencing hearing to let him know their preference for a prison facility.",
      "Also Monday, President Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a pardon. Mr. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname \"Puff Daddy,\" did not say if he would grant the request. Messages seeking comment on Mr. Trump's remarks were left for Combs' lawyers and his publicity team by The Associated Press.",
      "Combs' sentencing for two prostitution-related charges capped a federal case that featured harrowing testimony about violence, drugs and so-called \"freak-offs,\" and exposed the sordid private life of one of the most influential figures in music.",

      "Deonte' Nash alleged he was frightened throughout his roughly decade-long experience working for the music mogul. The 39-year-old stylist claims Combs choked him multiple times, describing one alleged incident that occurred after he went to a restaurant with R&B singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend whose testimony was critical in his conviction.",
      "The \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer was convicted in July under the federal\u00a0Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime. His trial ended in a split verdict, with acquittals on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put him behind bars for life.",
      "Combs has been locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Detention Center, since his September 2024 arrest. His time there will be subtracted from his sentence, meaning he could get out in about three years.",
      "In a letter to Subramanian on the eve of sentencing, Combs said he has gone through a \"spiritual reset\" in jail and is \"committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, non-violent and peaceful person.\"",
      "\"I thank God that I'm stronger, wiser, clean, clear and sober,\" he wrote.",
      "Subramanian has not yet acted on the request to recommend placement at FCI Fort Dix.",

Those decisions, the agency has said, are based on a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the required security level and an inmate's programming needs.",

An adjacent minimum-security prison camp has 210 inmates.",
      "Combs once owned a home in New Jersey, selling it nearly a decade ago.",

      "The White House is focusing on soybean farmers, since they've been hard hit by the Chinese boycott on American soybeans. Discussions about the package are still in early stages, one of the sources said.",
      "The Treasury Department and Agriculture Department are involved in the talks. Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on CNBC on Monday that \"we've had numerous meetings over the last week or two\" about \"what we're going to do\" about the hit farmers have taken. He promised the administration would take \"big measures\" and \"those big measures are going to be public really, really soon.\"",
      "Hassett acknowledged, \"Right now, the silos are full, and there are soybeans sitting on the ground with tarps over them. That's unacceptable to the president.\" He also said the administration is \"calling up all our soybean customers around the world as part of our trade negotiations.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge late Sunday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, after a legal whirlwind that began hours earlier when the president mobilized California troops for Portland after the same judge blocked him from using Oregon's National Guard the day before.",
      "During a hastily called telephone hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut granted a temporary restraining order sought by California and Oregon.",
      "A day earlier, the same judge temporarily blocked\u00a0the administration from deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. But on Sunday, the president moved to send National Guard troops to the state from neighboring California and then from Texas.",
      "Immergut, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, issued her second, more sweeping order late Sunday after she upbraided the federal government's attorney and questioned how the move to send the California and Texas troops to Oregon was not \"in direct contravention of the order that was issued yesterday.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "Small protests have been going on nightly outside Portland's immigration processing facility since Mr. Trump's second term began in January. There have been occasional flare-ups, including in June, but for weeks the demonstrations attracted only a few dozen people \u2014 until the Trump administration mobilized the Oregon National Guard\u00a0on Sept. 28 against Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek's wishes.",
      "A small number of demonstrators gathered Sunday evening cheered when they learned about the judge's order.",
      "Immergut issued Saturday's order pending further arguments in a lawsuit brought by the state and city. She said the relatively small protests didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.",
      "Her Saturday ruling came after Mr. Trump called the city \"war-ravaged.\" Oregon officials and Portland residents alike said that description was ludicrous.",
      "A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement that about 200 federalized members of the California National Guard who had been on duty around Los Angeles were being reassigned to Portland. Kotek said about 100 arrived Saturday and around 100 more were en route Sunday.",
      "The two states originally requested a narrower order that would have blocked only California National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon, but asked for the order to apply to all National Guard troops after a memo written by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was submitted to the court that said up to 400 Texas National Guard personnel were being activated for deployment to Oregon, Illinois and possibly elsewhere.",
      "Immergut grilled lawyers for the federal government, accusing them of seeking an end run around her Saturday order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon.",
      "\"How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention of the TRO I issued yesterday?\" she said Sunday.",
      "Immergut told one federal government attorney that he was \"missing the point\" because conditions on the ground in Oregon hadn't changed and she saw no legal basis and need for the military to assist local law enforcement.",
      "Lawyers for the federal government tried to argue that Oregon and Portland didn't have standing and that California could show no harm by having some of its National Guard dispatched to another state.",
      "Scott Kennedy, the attorney representing Oregon, said he learned of the Texas National Guard mobilization just 24 minutes before the emergency hearing on Sunday night. \"It feels a little bit like we're playing a game of rhetorical whack-a-mole here,\" he told Immergut.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a post on X Sunday night that he'd authorized the call-up of guard troops from his state. \"You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,\" he wrote.",
      "The events in Oregon come a day after Illinois' governor made a similar announcement about troops in his state being activated.",
      "Kotek said the latest move by federal officials is an attempt to circumvent Saturday's court ruling that blocked deployment of Oregon's guard members.",
      "\"The facts on the ground in Oregon haven't changed,\" Kotek said during a news conference Sunday. \"There's no need for military intervention in Oregon. There's no insurrection in Portland, there's no threat to national security.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that personnel from his state were on their way Sunday and called the deployment \"a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.\" He said these troops were \"federalized\" and put under the president's control months ago over his objections, in response to unrest in Los Angeles.",
      "\"The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens,\" Newsom said. In a post on X, he said California would sue to try to stop the deployment.",
      "After Immergut's late Sunday ruling, Newsom said on X, \"We just won in court \u2014 again. ... Trump's abuse of power won't stand.\"",
      "In a related court filing, an attorney in the California Military Department said the U.S. Army Northern Command advised the department on Sunday that an order will be issued keeping the 300 guard personnel federalized through the end of January.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Mr. Trump's move to deploy the National Guard of one state to another \"is well outside of the norms or practices\" of any president.",
      "\"But this President is determined to take as much power as the courts will give him. This fight isn't over, but today's rebuke of the president's illegal actions is a step in the right direction,\" Bonta said in a statement after Sunday night's ruling.",
      "Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said Sunday that he saw federal agents engaged in what he described as unjustified use of force and indiscriminately spraying pepper spray and impact munitions during a protest outside the ICE facility.",
      "\"This is an aggressive approach trying to inflame the situation that has otherwise been peaceful,\" Wilson said.",
      "Portland has alerted the civil rights division of the Department of Justice to the agents' actions, Wilson said.",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities.",

      "Maxwell's appeal to the high court attracted added attention this summer as the Trump administration came under pressure to release more material related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019. Congress also opened its own examination of the federal probe and has obtained and released thousands of pages of records related to Epstein, though many were already in the public domain.",

Asked Monday afternoon if he's considering a pardon, President Trump told reporters he'll \"take a look at it\" and will speak to the Justice Department, but added, \"I wouldn't consider it or not consider it. I don't know anything about it.\"",
      "At the heart of Maxwell's appeal is a 2007 nonprosecution agreement between the U.S. attorney in Miami and Epstein, which she argued barred her prosecution for sex-trafficking violations.",

In exchange for avoiding federal charges, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "The agreement specified that if Epstein fulfilled all of its terms, he would not be prosecuted \"in this district,\" the Southern District of Florida. It also contained a so-called co-conspirators clause, which stated that if Epstein satisfied the deal's conditions, the U.S. would \"not institute any criminal char[g]es against any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including but not limited to\" four of his assistants.",
      "A Justice Department official in West Palm Beach later told the department's Office of Professional Responsibility the provision was \"highly unusual,\" and a former prosecutor who handled the case said she didn't consider that Epstein may have been trying to protect anyone other than his four assistants, according to court records.",
      "Acosta went on to serve as labor secretary during Mr. Trump's first term, but he resigned in 2019 amid scrutiny of his handling of the nonprosecution agreement with Epstein. He stepped down shortly after Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in New York. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial.",
      "Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein's, was indicted in New York in 2020 and charged with several criminal offenses arising out of her scheme with Epstein. She attempted to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the co-conspirators clause in Epstein's nonprosecution agreement prohibited her prosecution because she was charged as his co-conspirator.",
      "A federal district court rejected Maxwell's effort, finding that the deal bound only the U.S. Attorney's Office in Florida. It also ruled that most of the charges would've fallen outside the scope of the agreement even if it covered the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York.",
      "Maxwell's trial proceeded, and she was found guilty in 2021. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Maxwell had been serving her sentence at a federal correctional facility in Tallahassee, but she was moved to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas after meeting with Blanche, the deputy attorney general, in July.",
      "She appealed her conviction and sentence on several grounds, including that the nonprosecution deal barred her prosecution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected her claims, ruling that \"nothing in the text of the NPA precluded\" the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan from bringing charges against Maxwell.",
      "Maxwell asked the Supreme Court to take up her case in April, arguing that the co-conspirator clause contained no \"geographic limitation\" on where it could be enforced. Her lawyers said in a filing that a decision from the Supreme Court should ensure that plea deals are enforced consistently throughout the country, \"so that when the United States makes a promise in a plea agreement, it is held to that promise.\"",
      "But the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court not to reconsider Maxwell's conviction and sentence. It noted that Justice Department policy at the time the deal was negotiated prohibited U.S. attorneys from entering into agreements that bound other districts unless they received written approval from those districts or the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.",
      "\"There is no indication here that anyone involved in negotiating Epstein's NPA obtained the necessary approval for binding other USAOs or thought it was necessary,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",

      "Taylor Swift made a splash at the box office this weekend with her \"The Official Release Party of a Showgirl\" film earning $34 million in U.S. ticket sales.",
      "The limited-time film, which debuted Oct. 3 \u2014 the same day Swift's album \"The Life of a Showgirl\" \u2014 was the top movie in the U.S. this past weekend. Globally, the movie earned a total of $50 million, according to an AMC spokesperson who shared ticket sale figures with CBS News.",
      "\"The Official Release Party of a Showgirl\" played at hundreds of theaters nationwide over the weekend to enthusiastic fans decked out in friendship bracelets and other Swift-themed attire. The movie featured the world premiere of Swift's music video, \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" one of the 12 tracks on her new studio album, along with behind-the-scenes footage.",
      "The album, released Friday, sold a total of 2.7 million physical and digital copies in its first day in the U.S, according to industry research firm Luminate. That broke Swift's record for most sales in the first week, according to the Associated Press. Her last album, 2024's \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" sold 2.6 million equivalent album units in the U.S. in its first week.",
      "\"For Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, told the Associated Press. \"To be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\"",
      "AMC announced the 89-minute\u00a0film\u00a0two weeks ago, prompting fans to flock to the chain's ticketing site for the limited theatrical run from Oct. 3 to Oct. 5 in the U.S. It is the largest grossing album debut theatrical event of all time at the domestic and global box office, according to the AMC spokesperson.",
      "The release marks Swift's second partnership with AMC. After the Eras Tour, which netted a record-breaking $2.2 billion, she released an accompanying concert film, becoming the biggest of its kind to date. That movie earned\u00a0between $95 million and $97 million in North America during its opening weekend.",
      "Other companies have also sought to cash in on the hype surrounding the 35-year-old pop star's new album, with Krispy Kreme offering doughnuts in its signature colors and KitchenAid releasing a limited-edition orange mixer inspired by the record. On Oct. 3, Magnum Ice Cream gave out glitter-coated bars at a pop-up on New York City's Cornelia Street, where Swift once lived.",
      "Despite mixed reviews from critics, Swift's \"The Life of a Showgirl\" became Spotify's most streamed album in a single day within 11 hours of its release.",

    "summary": "Mark Sanchez was hospitalized with multiple stab wounds following a violent altercation over the weekend.",
    "story": [
      "Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez was charged with a felony over a violent altercation in Indianapolis over the weekend, officials announced Monday.",
      "Sanchez was charged with battery involving serious bodily injury, a felony, Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears told reporters. If convicted, Sanchez would face a sentence ranging between one and six years, Mears said.",
      "Sanchez, who has been an NFL game analyst for Fox Sports since 2021, was hospitalized with multiple stab wounds following the altercation early Saturday morning. The Marion County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Sanchez was processed at the hospital, where he was receiving treatment, and has since paid bond. An initial court hearing for Sanchez scheduled for Tuesday was canceled, and the next hearing has been scheduled for Nov. 5, according to online court records.",
      "The incident stemmed from what Mears described as a dispute over where a man was parked.",
      "\"This was a situation that did not need to occur,\" Mears said. \"The allegations involve a 38-year-old man becoming involved in an altercation with a 69-year-old man who sustained significant and very severe injuries.\"",
      "Mears said the investigation was still in its early stages and additional charges could be filed.",
      "Sanchez also faces several misdemeanor charges, including battery resulting in injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle, authorities said in a statement.",
      "\"This has been a deeply distressing time for everyone involved,\" Nick Sanchez, Mark's brother, said Monday in a statement on behalf of the family.",
      "\"Mark and our family are incredibly grateful for the concern, love, and support we've received over the past few days,\" Nick Sanchez said. \"Mark remains under medical care for the serious injuries he sustained and is focused on his recovery as the legal process continues. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the first responders and medical staff.\"",
      "The other man involved in the altercation works for Restaurant Technologies, a Minnesota-based company that recycles and disposes of commercial cooking oil, according to the company and court documents. The man, identified in an affidavit for probable cause as P.T., was in a truck in an alley that was backed into a loading dock area for a Westin hotel when the incident unfolded.",
      "P.T. later told police that Sanchez had said he couldn't be at the loading dock, according to the affidavit. He initially thought that Sanchez could be the hotel's manager because he was well-dressed, the court document said. When P.T. leaned closer to Sanchez to try to hear him better because he wasn't wearing his hearing aids, he told police that Sanchez allegedly smelled of alcohol and his speech was slurred.",
      "When P.T. said he tried to get his cellphone from the truck to call his manager, Sanchez allegedly blocked him, according to the affidavit. He then tried to get into the truck on the passenger side, but Sanchez allegedly blocked him there, too. When P.T. tried again to get in on the driver's side, Sanchez allegedly shoved him, the court document said.",
      "P.T. said he sprayed Sanchez with pepper spray in the face, according to the affidavit. Sanchez wiped his face and then allegedly advanced toward the man, the document continued.",
      "\"This guy is trying to kill me,\" P.T. told police what he thought at the time.",
      "He said he pulled out a knife and stabbed Sanchez two or three times when Sanchez allegedly came at him, the court document said. P.T. told police he flew into a dumpster and fell on some pallets on the ground.",
      "\"While he was on the ground, P.T. was not aware of what Mr. Sanchez was physically doing to him, whether he was punching him or otherwise striking him,\" the affidavit states. \"While P.T. was on the ground, he could only see the feet of Mr. Sanchez coming at him, making P. T. realize that he was in a life-or-death situation.\"",
      "He told police he scrambled to his feet and stabbed Sanchez once more.",
      "P.T. recalled to police that Sanchez looked shocked as he slowly turned around and took off, according to the affidavit.",
      "The document stated that the man suffered a severe laceration to the side of his face.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 17:34:34 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration said violent crime rose in Memphis in 2024, but the city's police department data shows it went down.",
    "story": [
      "When the Trump administration set up a federal task force to address crime in Memphis, Tennessee, last month, it cited crime data that didn't match statistics from the city's police department.",
      "While a White House press release from September says violent crime rose in Memphis in 2024, Memphis Police Department data shows violent crime went down.",
      "\"Murder is at a six-year low, aggravated assault is at a five-year low and sexual assault at a twenty-year low,\" the MPD said in a press release last month.",
      "Can both be true? Technically, yes.",
      "Same city, different statistics",
      "The White House drew on FBI \"Crime in the U.S.\" data that shows over 15,000 violent crimes in Memphis in 2024, thousands more than what the city reports in the same time period.",
      "Two factors help explain the difference: geography and how the crimes are counted.",
      "The FBI counts crimes across the nine-county metro area, spanning parts of Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas, where the population is more than twice that of Memphis. The Memphis Police Department only counts crimes within city limits.",
      "The second crucial factor is that the FBI counts each victim of violent crime, while Memphis police count each incident. One shooting that injures three people is recorded as three assaults in FBI data but only one in the city police data, which can make totals appear higher if the distinction isn't clear.",
      "\"Our political leaders need to be really careful on how they talk about crime. Do they talk about the definitions?\" said Dr. Thaddeus Johnson, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice. \"Some of that nuance was lost in that conversation and they put people on edge.\"",
      "How violent crime is defined",
      "Crime statistics also differ in part because there is no one definition of \"violent crime.\" Different law enforcement agencies will use subtly different definitions.",
      "As the FBI defines it, there are four core crime categories within violent crime: murder/nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.",
      "To count and publish crime data, until recently the FBI used a longstanding system called the Summary Reporting System, or SRS. The program counts the four violent crime categories and tallies each incident once, even if there are multiple victims.",
      "In 2021, the FBI switched to a new system called NIBRS, or the National Incident-Based Reporting System. It uses the same violent crime categories as SRS but counts each victim rather than each incident.",
      "\"NIBRS data is a massive improvement,\" Jacob Kaplan, professional specialist at the School of Public and International Affairs, said in his book \"Decoding FBI Crime Data,\" published earlier this year. \"It has led to an explosion of research that allows a far more detailed analysis of crime.\"",
      "Local police departments like Memphis generally use the FBI's definitions of violent crime when publishing stats online. However, Memphis includes all types of homicides and lists subcategories like non-fatal shootings.",
      "The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics adds \"simple assault\" to its violent crime statistics, which includes attacks where no weapon was used and did not result in serious injury. They also include crimes never reported to police, but reported in annual surveys conducted by the agency.",
      "With all these different definitions, one agency's crime statistics can show crime rising while another shows it falling.",
      "\"All of them tell pieces of the truth,\" said Johnson. \"Read the fine print. Most local websites have the methodology. And it tells you, are they counting by incidents or the number of victimizations?\"",
      "Johnson recommends a few key checks when looking at crime statistics, whether on your local police dashboard or while scrolling social media.",
      "Definitions: What crimes are included?What's being counted: Are totals based on incidents or the number of victims?\u00a0Time frame: Are figures year-to-date, a rolling 12-month average or a single month?Reporting gaps: Many crimes are never reported to the police.",

      "Bessent said in the statement that the IRS and SSA \"share many of the same technological and customer service goals. This makes Mr. Bisignano a natural choice for this role.\"",
      "The appointment comes after several recent leadership changes at the IRS, with its most recent commissioner, former auctioneer and congressman Billy Long, stepping down in August after only two months on the job. Unlike previous IRS leaders, Long lacked a background in either accounting or tax law.",
      "Bisignano is a former Wall Street executive and CEO of Fiserv, a payments and financial services firm. In his role as IRS CEO, he'll report to Bessent, who will continue to serve as acting commissioner of the IRS, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "Bisignano's appointment to a second high-profile federal job raises concerns about his ability to oversee two major government agencies, according to Social Security advocates, who say that the SSA now faces\u00a0multiple challenges\u00a0as a result of the Trump administration cutting thousands of jobs at the agency earlier this year.",
      "\"Never in Social Security's 90-year history has a commissioner held a second job,\" said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, in an email. \"Bisignano's new role will leave a leadership vacuum at the top of the agency, especially since the Republican Senate hasn't even confirmed a deputy commissioner.\"",
      "Added Max Richtman, CEO of another advocacy group, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare: \"Seniors, people with disabilities and their families deserve a full-time Social Security Commissioner. Full stop.\"",

    "story": [
      "A new intelligence bulletin published by a non-profit security organization warns that extremist groups are increasingly using artificial intelligence to intensify antisemitic propaganda, recruitment and operations targeting Jewish communities across North America.",
      "The bulletin, authored by Secure Communities Network, an independent organization dedicated to safeguarding the Jewish community in North America, outlines how both foreign terrorist organizations and domestic violent extremists are exploiting AI tools \u2013 including chatbots, deepfake imagery and generative content \u2013 in order to automate and amplify disinformation, spread antisemitic narratives and spur the self-radicalization of lone actors.",
      "The bulletin notes that as \"AI-generated content begins to create increasingly higher-quality images, the line between real and fake blurs,\" making false antisemitic material appear more credible.",
      "In one cited incident in July 2025, the chatbot \"Grok,\" which was created by Elon Musk's xAI, posted antisemitic and extremist content, including praise for Hitler and references to neo-Nazi rhetoric, following a system update.",
      "According to the report, the posting began when an X user made a post \"celebrating\" the deaths of children and counselors from Camp Mystic following the floods in Texas Hill Country over the July 4 weekend. \"After Grok was tagged to respond to the post, it made a remark about the poster's surname and used the phrase 'every damn time,'\" according to the bulletin, \"which is frequently leveraged by neo-Nazis as a way of accusing Jewish people of persistently being the cause of negative aspects of one's life.\"",
      "The bulletin also cites examples of violent acts not directly tied to antisemitism that allegedly used artificial intelligence to assist in planning an explosion, illustrating how artificial intelligence can aid operational tactics. When a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, the report noted, Matthew Livelsberger allegedly used the AI chat bot ChatGPT to assist in gathering information about explosives and planning the attack.",
      "At the time, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, stated, \"This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\" later calling it, \"a concerning moment.\"",
      "SCN analysts also found that in response to recent Israeli\u2013Iranian tensions, Iranian-sponsored AI-generated disinformation has surged, including fabricated images of attacks on Israel. The bulletin argues that these threats pose increased challenges for law enforcement and communal security, because AI tools are harder to trace and moderate in real time.",
      "According to the FBI, 2024 was recorded as the worst year for anti-Jewish hate crimes since federal law enforcement began reporting hate crime data in 1991. Anti-Jewish incidents increased by 5.8% compared to the previous year, rising from 1,832 in 2023 to 1,938 in 2024.

    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2025, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-lgbtq-free-speech-colorado-conversion-therapy-ban/",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:18:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear a case brought by a licensed counselor in Colorado, who argues her state's ban on \"conversion therapy\" violates her First Amendment rights.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Tuesday to consider a legal battle involving a Colorado law banning \"conversion therapy\" treatment for minors brought by a licensed counselor in the state, which she argues unconstitutionally censors her conversations about gender dysphoria and sexuality with young clients.",
      "The plaintiff, Kaley Chiles, is a licensed counselor who performs \"faith-informed\" counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, says she seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\" But she fears that doing so will put her in violation of Colorado's law.",
      "\"They're peering into the counseling room and intruding on these private counseling conversations,\" Chiles told CBS News.",
      "Chiles' case is one of several raising hot-button issues that the Supreme Court will hear in its new term, which began Monday. In addition to weighing Colorado's ban, the high court will also consider state laws banning transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports, as well as a major voting rights dispute and where people with concealed-carry permits can bring handguns.",
      "Colorado is one of at least 20 states that prohibit mental health professionals from engaging in \"conversion therapy\" with minors. Colorado defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The law took effect in 2019, and in 2022, Chiles filed a lawsuit against Colorado and its licensing officials, arguing that the law violates her free speech rights by censoring her conversations based on viewpoint and the content of them. She sought a court order preventing Colorado from enforcing the ban against her.",
      "Colorado has not taken any disciplinary action against Chiles or any other licensed therapist for violating the ban, it said in court papers, and the state asserts that the talk therapy Chiles' aims to provide wouldn't defy its law because she expressly doesn't seek to change a patient's gender identity or sexual orientation.",
      "A federal district court allowed Chiles' suit to go forward but ruled against her, finding that Colorado's law regulates the professional conduct of mental health professionals, not speech. The court also found that the state has legitimate interests in protecting young people from what it says is a \"harmful and ineffective\" treatment.",
      "A divided federal appeals court upheld that decision, ruling that Colorado's law only prohibits a mental health professional from engaging in the practice of conversion therapy. The court said the measure is a regulation of professional conduct that incidentally burdens speech.",
      "In seeking the Supreme Court's review, Chiles argued that her speech is being chilled because she has been forced to turn away clients seeking counseling that explore sexuality and gender identity. She is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy group.",
      "\"In general, the adolescents who are reaching out, asking for therapy might have a variety of concerns and issues that counseling can be helpful with. Many people who are struggling with issues of sex and sexuality also have co-occurring disorders all the way from suicidality to any other mental health challenge like anxiety, depression, et cetera,\" Chiles said. \"When I'm having to turn them away, they don't get help that is helpful for any of those issues. They are just without a course to be able to offer true help to them from a professional.\"",
      "Chiles' lawyers have argued that Colorado's law prevents families and teens who want to address gender dysphoria by aligning identity and sex from working with a licensed counselor to help reach that goal. But under the measure, practices that provide assistance to patients undergoing gender transition are allowed, they said.",
      "\"It's not the government's role to peer into the counseling room and say some goals are permitted. Some goals are forbidden. Some speech is allowed. Some speech is forbidden,\" Jonathan Scruggs, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, said. \"In this country, we let the people decide what information they want. We don't let government bureaucrats decide. That's really the choice before the court.\"",
      "Chiles' lawyers also warned that if the law as applied to talk therapy is allowed, it could open the door to states imposing regulations on licensed professionals that could sweep up speech on all types of topics, like doctors discussing birth control or therapists encouraging divorce.",
      "\"Colorado's principle is really like a government censorship free-for-all,\" Scruggs said. \"Their theory is any time you have professionals giving advice, the government has total discretion to either ban or compel speech in that context. Would some states ban counselors from encouraging divorce? Or using contraception or the reverse?\"",
      "But Colorado officials said there is a long history of states regulating the health care profession to protect patients from substandard treatment, and the First Amendment has never barred states from doing that. Colorado pointed to medical malpractice laws and other licensing regimes, which lawyers said have long covered mental health and other treatments performed with words.",
      "\"This is because these words are used by a professional in a fiduciary relationship, to provide individualized treatment based on specialized knowledge, for the sole purpose of promoting the patient's health,\" officials wrote.",
      "Additionally, they have argued conversion therapy is ineffective and associated with depression, anxiety, loss of faith and suicidality, regardless of how it is performed. Major medical associations have warned that efforts to change a patient's sexual orientation or gender identity are potentially harmful to young people and not supported by credible scientific evidence.",
      "Colorado officials have also pushed back on Chiles' claim that it is trying to tamp down on certain speech \u2014 discouraging gender transition \u2014 that it disfavors.",
      "\"The only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor's sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\" they said in court papers.",
      "Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, said the law leaves room for legitimate therapy.",
      "\"What's prohibited by these laws is a very specific, very narrow set of practices, with the therapist trying to impose their own agenda on a minor patient, trying to seek a predetermined outcome,\" he said.",
      "Colorado lawyers and those backing the state warned that if Chiles' prevails, it would destabilize longstanding health care regulation and gut states' power to ensure mental health professionals adhere to the standard of care.",
      "\"If the court were to accept Chiles' argument that any time there's a professional regulation of medical care that applies to what a provider can and cannot say, that that's a free speech issue, that those laws are automatically subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment, that would be a very revolutionary, dramatic change in the current legal landscape. It would put countless other types of medical and mental health regulations into jeopardy,\" Minter said.",
      "Both sides have cited the Supreme Court's 2018 decision in a case involving a California law that required \"crisis pregnancy centers\" to provide certain notices to patients, which the high court found likely violated the First Amendment. In the majority opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court wrote \"speech is not unprotected merely because it is uttered by 'professionals,'\" and warned that regulating the content of professionals' speech risks suppression of unpopular ideas.",
      "The Trump administration is backing Chiles in the case, but told the Supreme Court in a filing that it should send the case back to lower courts for further proceedings. The Justice Department will participate in oral arguments Tuesday.",
      "\"Colorado is muzzling one side of an ongoing debate in the mental-health community about how to discuss questions of gender and sexuality with children,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing. \"Under the First Amendment, the State bears a heavy burden to justify that content-based restriction on protected speech.\"",
      "Federal appeals courts that have weighed state bans on conversion therapy have divided over their legality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit invalidated local restrictions in Florida in 2020, finding that \"the First Amendment has no carveout for controversial speech.\" But appeals courts in Philadelphia and San Francisco have upheld bans in New Jersey and Washington.",
      "The Supreme Court in 2023 turned away a challenge to Washington's law, leaving the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in place. Three justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, said they would have taken up the case.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Thomas wrote there is \"little question\" that Washington's law regulates speech and implicates the First Amendment. He argued that under the measure, licensed counselors can only convey a \"state-approved message of encouraging minors to explore their gender identities.\"",

      "\"At this very moment, President Trump's comprehensive plan to release all remaining hostages andfinally end this terrible war is on the table,\" the forum says in its letter. \"For the first time in months, we are hopeful that our nightmare will finally be over. We are confident that he will not rest until the last hostage is brought home, the war has ended, and peace and prosperity are restored to the people of the Middle East.\"",
      "Egypt's foreign ministry said\u00a0the talks would focus on \"establishing the necessary humanitarian and logistical conditions for implementing a prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hamas.\"",
      "According to Mr. Trump's proposal, the exchange would see the 48 remaining Israeli hostages released. Israeli officials believe about 20 of them are still alive. After that, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners who are being held by Israel would be freed. Of those prisoners, 250 are serving life sentences and 1,700 are from Gaza and were detained after the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "The talks will also \"address the details of the process in line with the plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, aimed at ending the war and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza,\" Egypt's foreign ministry said.",
      "Amid the signs of a potential deal, Israeli strikes continued Sunday in Gaza, although CBS News sources said there were fewer than before Mr. Trump's proposal was announced. The IDF said it \"struck and eliminated a terrorist cell armed with explosive devices and mortars that were intended to be used in terror attacks against IDF troops in the area of Gaza City.\"",
      "An Israeli government spokesperson said Sunday that \"certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip,\" but they added that there is \"no ceasefire in place at this point in time.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that Israel's bombing of Gaza would need to stop for the remaining hostages to be released.",
      "\"I'd give it a 50% shot of happening, because both sides feel the pressure to get this done. Israel feels the pressure from the U.S., and Hamas feels the pressure from Qatar, from Turkey, from Egypt, from Jordan, and from Saudi Arabia,\" former senior Israeli diplomat Alon Pinkas told CBS News on Monday, referring to the possible hostage and prisoner swap. \"As for the rest of the plan, the likelihood goes down from 50% to maybe 10%. I just doubt it's going to happen. Even this phase is going to be as ambiguous and amenable to interpretations, and I don't see it going smoothly.\"",
      "Ohad Ben Ami, who was captured by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack and released in a prisoner swap in February, said he was eager for a deal to get done.",
      "\"Now it seems like there is hope,\" Ben Ami said over the weekend at an event. He added that felt betrayed by Israel's government.",
      "\"I love my country, and I love the people, but our government is disconnected. And until now, I have the feeling of insult. I feel that they abandoned me,\" he said.",
      "During his time in captivity, Ben Ami was first held above ground in a series of apartments in Gaza before being moved down into Hamas' vast tunnel network underneath the Palestinian territory, where he said he and other hostages were kept in squalid conditions and not given enough to eat.",
      "\"I'm here with you. I speak and I talk, but in my mind, I'm down there,\" Ben Ami said at the Sunday event. \"Until they \u2026 come back, all the 48 (remaining hostages), I cannot live. I'm still a hostage. I'm a free man, but not in my soul.\"",

    "story": [
      "East China Sea \u2014\u00a0Over the deep blue waters of the East China Sea, a Canadian military aircraft surveys the vast expanse below. The CP-140 Aurora, a maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force, is designed primarily to hunt enemy submarines \u2014 but this crew is on a different mission: tracking North Korean vessels engaged in illicit trade that violates United Nations sanctions.",
      "\"There are definitely some boats that look more suspicious than others,\" the captain currently deployed on the operation tells CBS News as he pilots the plane. The Canadian air force asked CBS News not to use the captain's name as he is still on active duty.",
      "Operating in international airspace over international waters, the mission \u2014 known as Operation NEON \u2014 takes the plane close to Chinese territory, often triggering a dramatic response by Beijing, which intercepts the Aurora on multiple occasions during its mission while a CBS News crew is onboard.",
      "Operation NEON is Canada's contribution to a coordinated multinational effort to support the implementation of U.N. Security Council sanctions against North Korea, as U.N. member states seek to apply pressure on Pyongyang to abandon its programs developing weapons of mass destruction.",
      "NEON is an intelligence gathering mission \u2014 they take photos, video and log suspicious vessels in the East China Sea, and then share the information with the United Nations' Enforcement Coordination Cell.",
      "The mission is based out of Kadena Air Base in Japan \u2014 the largest U.S. Air Force base in the Asia-Pacific region \u2014 known as the \"keystone of the Pacific\" due to its strategic importance.",
      "During the mission, a Chinese supersonic fighter jet appears and approaches the Canadian air force plane.",
      "Unhappy with the Canadian presence, the Chinese pilot hails Aurora's captain, who calmly responds: \"I'm a Canadian aircraft operating in international airspace, carrying out the duties of all nations.\"",
      "There is no verbal reply from the Chinese, but the Chinese fighter jet shadows the Aurora for another 30 minutes or so.",
      "\"As long as things remain professional and safe, this mission continues unabated,\" Brigadier General Jeff Davis, who commands the Canadian operation, tells CBS News.",
      "Soon after, the Chinese fighter jet disappears, but it's only a temporary halt to the Chinese actions. A few hours later, another jet appears, this one carrying missiles. All crew members move into position to document the second intercept.",
      "The jet, flying just four wing lengths' away \u2014 less than 200 feet \u2014 comes closer than any Chinese fighter has come to the Aurora throughout its mission.",
      "China has been North Korea's economic lifeline since international sanctions were imposed on Pyongyang in 2006, after its first nuclear test.",
      "But the sanctions clearly have not had the desired effect. Russia and China used to be opposed to North Korea's nuclear development, but not any more.",
      "China has been a vital economic lifeline for the Kim regime in Pyongyang, propping up North Korea's economy. More recently, Russia has also played a big role, giving the North oil in exchange for ammunition and troops deployed in support of Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "The Kim dynasty has long hoped to force the world to accept North Korea as a nuclear power. It's currently estimated to possess approximately 50 nuclear weapons, and is on the verge of developing a long-range missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Near the end of August, while meeting South Korea's new president, President Trump said he wanted another meeting with Kim Jong Un. They met three times during Mr. Trump's first term, but the summits garnered no results toward denuclearizing North Korea.",
      "Kim has said since that he's open to continuing the dialogue only if Mr. Trump abandons his government's \"absurd obsession with denuclearization.\"",
      "While these Chinese intercepts of the international sanctions enforcement mission over the East China Sea are expected, they undeniably increase the risks for the Canadian crew.",
      "\"It can add some stressors,\" the Canadian pilot tells CBS News. \"Sometimes they're trying to maneuver, but we try to mitigate as best we can and keep the aircraft safe.\"",

    "summary": "An appeals court in France is hearing the case of a man sentenced to nine years in prison for his role in a drugging and rape trial.",
    "story": [
      "Less than a year after the landmark verdict in a drugging and rape trial that shook France and turned Gis\u00e8le Pelicot into a global icon, she was greeted with applause Monday as she arrived at a courthouse for the appeal of a man challenging his conviction.",
      "Husamettin Dogan, sentenced to nine years in prison last December, denies he intended to rape Pelicot. He argues that he was deceived by Dominique Pelicot, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's ex-husband, who drugged his wife and offered her to strangers online before filming the assaults.",
      "The 44-year-old construction worker went on trial Monday in Nimes, in southern France, on charges of aggravated rape by administering substances that impair judgment or self-control, an offense carrying up to 20 years in prison.",
      "He remains free pending the verdict. Prosecutors had sought 12 years at his first trial, but the court imposed nine.",
      "Wearing a pink jacket, Pelicot entered the courthouse under police escort, smiling as she shook hands with supporters who shouted \"Thank you!\" and other words of encouragement.",
      "In the original proceedings, Pelicot's ex-husband and 50 other men were convicted of sexually assaulting her between 2011 and 2020 while she was under chemical submission. Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison, while sentences for other defendants ranged from three to 15 years imprisonment.",
      "The trial drew international attention after Gis\u00e8le Pelicot opposed a closed hearing, a demand made by several defendants. The court sided with her.",
      "According to the French newspaper Le Monde, which covered the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at one point said in court that the reason she wanted the hearings to happen publicly was so that \"all women who are victims of rape can say to themselves: 'Madame Pelicot did it, so we can do it.'\"",
      "\"I don't want them to feel ashamed anymore. It's not for us to feel shame \u2014 it's for them [sexual attackers],\" she said. \"Above all, I'm expressing my will and determination to change this society.\"",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said on the trial's opening day that \"shame must change sides.\" After the verdict, she declared she had \"never regretted that decision\" to push for public proceedings and thanked supporters who gave her the \"strength\" to return to court each day.",
      "The evidence presented at trial included stomach-churning homemade videos of the abuse that Dominique Pelicot filmed in the couple's home in the small Provence town of Mazan and elsewhere.",
      "A national reckoning",
      "Pelicot has since become a symbol of the fight against sexual violence and the shocking case spurred a national reckoning over rape culture in France. Her trial sparked protests across the country, and some demonstrators said they hoped the case could catalyze changes to certain French laws that deal with consent.",
      "Dominique Pelicot admitted his role and did not appeal his 20-year prison sentence, now final. He is expected to testify during the appeals hearing after being implicated by the remaining defendant.",
      "Of the 51 convicted men, 17 initially filed appeals. Most of those were withdrawn and only Dogan pursued his appeal.",
      "While last year's trial stretched over four months, the retrial is scheduled to last no more than four days, with a verdict expected Thursday.",
      "Civil proceedings in Avignon are due in November to settle damages owed to the main victim and her family, to be paid jointly by the convicted men.",

    "story": [
      "On a recent afternoon, Kenrick Modie finished untangling his fishing net in a quiet Caribbean village.",
      "As he slipped into a hammock at his home overlooking the sea, he worried that his life and livelihood could be wiped out by a U.S. military strike.",
      "Modie lives in the Caribbean twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, which is now entangled in a geopolitical face-off between the United States and Venezuela, just 11 miles away.",
      "U.S. President Trump \"is giving instructions to shoot and kill people,\" Modie said about recent U.S. military strikes targeting suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean as it bulks up its military presence in the region. \"What could we do? We're just a little dot.\"",
      "The United States has carried out at least four strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the waters off Venezuela in recent weeks, with at least two of the vessels originating from Venezuela. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the fourth strike on Friday, saying \"four male narco-terrorists\" were killed, but offering no other details on who they were.",
      "Mr. Trump declared in a notification to Congress viewed by CBS News that the U.S. was in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the Caribbean, alleging they are trying to bring \"deadly poison\" to U.S. shores.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela has accused the U.S. of military buildup and aggression, prompting President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to place the country's military and civilians willing to take up arms on high alert.",
      "Stuck in the middle is Trinidad and Tobago, a nation with a multimillion-dollar fishing industry that employs thousands of fishermen who cast their nets almost daily to sustain themselves and their families.",
      "\"If we die, we die\"",
      "Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has said that drug cartels have contributed to pain and suffering in her country, and she has urged the U.S. to \"kill them all violently.\"",
      "She also said she is willing to grant the U.S. access to Trinidad and Tobago, if needed, so Americans can defend Guyana from neighboring Venezuela, which has claimed two-thirds of Guyana as its own.",
      "Maduro said that Persad-Bissessar's willingness to grant such access is like declaring war against Venezuela. The Venezuelan president has called for a return to good relations with its Caribbean neighbor, even as Trinidad and Tobago's government claims there's no bad blood between the countries.",
      "While those in authority trade words and military commanders ramp up their posturing, dozens of fishermen in Trinidad and Tobago feel their lives are at risk, given the ongoing U.S. strikes and escalation of tensions with Venezuela.",
      "\"If we die, we die, that's how this life is,\" Modie said.",
      "He fears being killed by a U.S. military strike while out fishing because he believes his boat could be mistaken for a drug-smuggling vessel. Modie said he hasn't seen substantial evidence that those killed in the U.S. strikes were indeed transporting drugs. He also worries about innocent fishermen being killed and falsely labelled as narco-terrorists by authorities, with the dead men being unable to clear their names.",
      "Fishing in fear",
      "Only seven miles separate Trinidad and Venezuela at their closest point. On a clear day, Venezuela is visible from the village of Icacos, which is located on Trinidad's southwestern tip.",
      "Driving around Icacos and neighboring Cedros village, dozens of boats strewn along the shoreline show how heavily these communities depend on fishing.",
      "Fishermen in these two villages say they are already under threat from pirates, and the military buildup at sea now adds yet another threat.",
      "Watching three other fishermen unload their catch for the day at the Cedros Fishing Complex, Kamal Bikeran said his crew now stays in shallower waters and isn't going as far out to sea as before, because of the tension involving the three countries.",
      "\"The U.S. has come there, and the Venezuelan military is saying they are more present, so you have to watch out,\" Bikeran said. \"At any point in time, outside there, you could be taken out.\"",
      "Forced to fish in shallower waters, Bikeran and other fishermen said the heightened regional tension is drying up their livelihoods, as they are now catching fewer fish.",
      "Mr. Trump gave fishermen a reason to worry after the first U.S. military strike on Sept. 2, which he said killed 11 suspected narco-terrorists.",
      "\"Boat traffic is substantially down,\" Mr. Trump said in early September. \"I don't even know about fishermen. They may say, 'I'm not getting on the boat.'\"",
      "The president repeated that sentiment in remarks Sunday at an event celebrating 250 years of the U.S. Navy in Norfolk, Virginia, saying, \"We're so good at it that there are no boats. In fact, even fishing boats. Nobody wants to go into the water anymore.\"",
      "Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in late September, Caribbean leaders referred to the region as a zone of peace.",
      "Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley appealed for dialogue to avoid a war between the U.S. and Venezuela. The prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalves, described the foreign militarization of the waters near Venezuela as \"exceedingly troubling.\"",
      "Fishing in fear has become the new reality, said Shyam Hajarie, who has been a fisherman for more than 40 years. The Cedros native, like others, depends on his daily catches to support his family. He's unsure if the military buildup in the Caribbean would soon affect fish prices at the market.",

      "Takaichi, 64, immediately needs to seek ways to get her long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stay in power and regain public support by delivering measures to address inflation and diplomatic challenges, including how to deal with President Trump.",
      "\"Japan has just elected its first female Prime Minister, a highly respected person of great wisdom and strength. This is tremendous news for the incredible people of Japan. Congratulations to all!\" Mr. Trump said in a message posted on his own Truth social media network.",
      "Takaichi was chosen by her party members to lead, and as her party holds the most seats in Japan's parliament, she is set to become the prime minister. She was not elected personally by Japanese voters in a national election.",
      "A staunch supporter of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's conservative vision, Takaichi is on the verge of losing her party's long-time coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed dovish centrist Komeito, because of her ultra-conservative politics. Those include a revisionism of wartime history and regular visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of militarism.",
      "faces the dilemma of sticking to her ideology and losing the coalition partner or shifting to the center, which would lose her fans of her hawkish politics.",
      "The LDP and opposition parties are currently considering convening the parliament in mid-October to formally elect a new prime minister.",
      "Takaichi is likely to be Japan's leader because the LDP, even without a majority in either house of parliament following consecutive election losses, is still by far the largest in the lower house, which decides the national leader, and because opposition groups are highly splintered.",
      "She will need to address rising prices to restore support for the struggling party.",
      "She also faces another big test when she hosts a possible summit later this month with Mr. Trump as his trip to Asia to attend international conferences is planned.",
      "In her first press conference Saturday as LDP leader, Takaichi vowed to ensure strengthening of the Japan-U.S. alliance as essential to her country's diplomacy and security, while also seeking to expand trilateral partnerships including South Korea, Australia and the Philippines.",
      "Takaichi said she will honor the tariffs and investment agreements between the government of the current prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba and the Trump administration.",
      "One of Takaichi's most urgent tasks is to secure cooperation from the opposition. The LDP seeks to expand its current coalition with the moderate centrist Komeito to include at least one of the key opposition parties, which are center-right.",
      "But instead of finding a third partner, Takaichi is on the verge of losing Komeito, which is critical of her regular visits to the Yasukuni Shrine and her recent emphasis on stricter measures against the growing foreign population in Japan.",
      "In a rare move that shakes their 26-year-partnership, Komeito leader Tetsuo Saito told Takaichi on Saturday that his party has \"big worry and concern\" about her positions and would not stay in the coalition unless these positions are dropped.",
      "As new party president, Takaichi's first job is to decide a lineup of top LDP party posts, which she is expected to announce Tuesday.",
      "Takaichi has turned to the LDP's most powerful kingmaker and former prime minister Taro Aso, a conservative who backed her and reportedly influenced Saturday's party vote. She is expected to appoint him as deputy prime minister and name his brother-in-law and former Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki as party secretary general.",
      "Aso on Monday met with a senior official of the key opposition Democratic Party for the People about possible cooperation. Another opposition party, Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai, had been open to a coalition under Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who lost to Takaichi in Saturday's runoff vote, but that is now up in the air.",
      "Political watchers say Takaichi is considering appointing those who voted for her in the runoff as a reward. Among them is Toshimitsu Motegi, who is close to Aso and has served in key ministerial posts including as foreign and trade ministers. He is being considered for the position of top diplomat.",
      "Takaichi has also suggested appointing a number of former Abe faction lawmakers implicated in slush funds and other scandals to senior posts, despite public criticism over the party's lack of reform measures and subsequent election losses.",

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "The award is the first of the 2025 Nobel Prize announcements and was announced by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who founded the prizes. Nobel was a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. He died in 1896.",

    "story": [
      "Police in the U.K. have issued a public appeal to identify two people in connection with a suspected arson attack on a mosque in the town of Peacehaven on England's south coast. Authorities said Monday that emergency services were called after reports of a fire at a mosque over the weekend, and that \"evidence from the scene suggests the fire was started deliberately.\"",
      "Police are treating the attack as a possible hate crime, which came just days after a\u00a0deadly terror attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, in northern England, that left two Jewish people dead. At least six people have been detained in connection with that attack, and the primary suspect was fatally shot by police at the scene.",
      "On Sunday, the Sussex Police force released security camera images of two men they hope to identify in connection with the arson attack. The men appear in the images wearing black masks and dark clothing.",
      "The security video showed the two men approaching the front door of the mosque and then spraying an accelerant at the entrance and igniting a fire, according to the police, who said there were no injuries and that everyone at the mosque managed to escape.",
      "Emergency officials rushed to the scene Saturday at close to 10 p.m. local time and were able to promptly extinguish the fire, a spokesperson for East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said.",
      "\"This was an appalling and reckless attack which we know will have left many people feeling less safe,\" Detective Inspector Gavin Patch said in a statement Sunday. \"We are treating this as an arson with intent to endanger life and are continuing to pursue a number of lines of enquiry to identify those responsible.\"",
      "Katy Bourne, Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner, called the arson attack \"the height of hateful criminality.\"",
      "\"Sussex Police have put an enhanced presence at the scene and extra patrols at other places of worship across the county,\" Bourne said on Sunday.",
      "The U.K. chapter of Amnesty International condemned\u00a0the attack on Monday in a statement on X, saying it \"follows months of increasing hostility to racialized and migrant communities in the U.K. \u2014 boosted by anti-migrant rhetoric across the political spectrum.\"",
      "British police were still questioning, meanwhile, six people arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses following last week's stabbing and car ramming attack on the synagogue in Manchester.",
      "Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian origin, was shot dead by police Thursday outside the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue after he rammed a car into pedestrians, attacked them with a knife and tried to force his way into the building.",

      "The ancient artwork's disappearance was reported over the weekend, just more than three weeks after officials confirmed that a golden bracelet stolen from the Egyptian Museum by a restoration worker had been sold on and then melted down.",
      "The rare limestone relief vanished from a Fifth Dynasty tomb, dating to between 2500 and 2350 B.C., in the Saqqara Necropolis, south of Cairo, Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a statement posted online Sunday.",
      "The tomb belonged to a high-ranking official named Khenti Ka, who held titles including \"Priest of the Goddess Maat\" and \"Overseer of the Royal Palace,\" archaeologist Ali Abu Deshish told CBS News.",
      "\"The tomb is distinguished by its remarkable reliefs portraying scenes of daily life in ancient Egypt,\" Abu Deshish said.",
      "Calling the theft \"a catastrophe by all standards,\" he said Egypt's antiquities \"are not for sale. They belong to the heritage of all humanity.\"",
      "The roughly 16 x 24-inch relief that is now missing depicts the three ancient Egyptian seasons: Akhet (inundation), Peret (growth), and Shemu (harvest).",
      "Local media reported that the artifact appeared to have been cut out of the wall of the tomb with an electric saw.",
      "The ministry said the tomb had been completely sealed and was used as a storage space for antiquities since its discovery in the 1950s, and it had not been opened since 2019.",
      "Upon discovering the relief missing, an archaeological committee was formed to inventory all of the tomb's contents. After confirming media reports of the disappearance, the ministry said \"all necessary legal measures have been taken and the entire matter has been referred to the Public Prosecution for investigation.\"",
      "The incident comes just weeks before the scheduled opening ceremony of the new Grand Egyptian Museum, a sprawling, 5.2-million-square-foot facility near the ancient pyramids of Giza that has taken years and more than $1 billion to bring to fruition. It is intended to be a new cornerstone of Egypt's antiquities-focused tourism industry.",
      "It also comes just weeks after officials confirmed that the roughly 3,000-year-old golden bracelet believed to have been worn by a pharaoh had disappeared from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
      "Authorities discovered that it was stolen by a museum restoration worker, sold for less than $4,000 and then melted down and lost forever.",
      "Unlike in the case of the bracelet, experts believe whoever stole the limestone relief may have known the real value of the artifact.",
      "\"It is not merely a decorative artifact but one that carries profound symbolic meaning related to the cycle of life, agriculture, and fertility in ancient Egyptian belief, which suggests that whoever stole it understood its true value and scholarly significance,\" Abu Deshish told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The resignation of another French prime minister deepens the country's political crisis and draws a call from far-right leader Marine Le Pen for national elections.",
    "story": [
      "France's government collapsed Monday after the country's Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu tendered his resignation less than a day after appointing his cabinet. The resignation of the country's second-highest-ranking public official plunged France further into a political crisis that has seen a rotating cast of five different prime ministers\u00a0in less than two years.",
      "France has been mired in political paralysis since President\u00a0Emmanuel Macron, who appoints the prime minister, called snap national elections last year that left no political party with an outright majority in the parliament, which is called the National Assembly.",
      "\"The political parties continue to adopt a posture as if they all had an absolute majority in the National Assembly. And basically, I found myself in a situation where I was ready to compromise, but each political party wants the other political party to adopt its entire program,\" Lecornu said in his resignation speech on Monday.",
      "The leader of France's far-right movement, Marine Le Pen, called on Monday for new snap parliamentary elections in the aftermath of the government's collapse. Le Pen's anti-immigration, nationalist National Rally (RN) party was previously relegated to the fringes of national politics, but it has captured a considerable number of seats in the fragmented parliament in recent years.",
      "\"There is no solution, there won't be one tomorrow: I call on the President of the Republic to dissolve the National Assembly,\" Le Pen said in a social media post.",
      "Lecornu, a political ally of the increasingly embattled Macron, held the position of prime minister for just less than a month, but only announced a new cabinet to govern the country on Sunday. Lecornu's decision to step down makes him the shortest-serving prime minister in the history of the Fifth French Republic.",
      "Fearing an ascendant far-right, which also swept up many seats in European Union parliamentary elections in June 2024, Macron gambled on his party and its allies winning the surprise election\u00a0for seats in the National Assembly that he called soon after. But his bet did not pay off, and his centrist coalition lost a huge number of seats to both Le Pen's party and an alliance of far-left parties.",
      "Political instability has followed ever since, with successive governments folding after coming up against a deadlocked National Assembly. The instability has been amplified by a growing national debt crisis and a ballooning budget deficit which have knocked confidence in the EU's second largest economy.",
      "Last month, the U.S. credit ratings agency Fitch downgraded France's credit rating, citing \"increased fragmentation and polarization of domestic politics,\" and a deterioration of the nation's public finances.",
      "Lecornu's predecessor Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was ousted from power in September by a no confidence vote in the parliament after he failed to push through a budget program that would have cut public spending in an effort to address the country's mounting debt.",
      "Nationwide strikes over potential austerity measures in the looming French government budget for 2026 have also caused chaos across the country in recent weeks.",
      "On Thursday, thousands of protesters, led by students, trade unions and retirees, took to the streets of more than 200 towns and cities across France to denounce proposed spending cuts and demand higher taxes on the rich.",

More than that, they had all been good to you and your children over many years, as you acknowledged in your testimony,\" Beale said when he delivered the original sentence. \"Not only did you cut short three lives and cause lasting damage to Ian Wilkinson's health, thereby devastating extended Patterson and Wilkinson families, you inflicted untold suffering on your own children, whom you robbed of their beloved grandparents.\"",
      "It was never disputed that Patterson served the mushrooms or that the pastries killed her guests. The jury was required to decide whether she knew the lunch contained death caps, and if she intended for them to die.",

      "Three Court of Appeal judges will hear both appeals on a date that is yet to be set.",

      "Israel's foreign ministry called the detained activists \"provocateurs,\" and said that some of them were \"deliberately obstructing the legal deportation process, preferring instead to linger in Israel.\" The ministry also said that some foreign governments \"have shown reluctance to accept flights that would return these provocateurs.\" Israel did not specify which activists were resisting deportation, or which countries were hesitating to accept flights.",
      "Israel's government has also accused some of the flotilla members of being linked to Hamas, while providing little evidence to support the claim. Members of the flotilla have strongly rejected the accusations and said Israel was trying to justify potential attacks on them.",
      "Supporters of the flotilla took to the streets in major demonstrations around the world starting Thursday, according to the Associated Press. More than 2 million people in Italy took part in a one-day general strike meant to support Gazans on Friday. Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend a protest in Rome on Saturday.",
      "In Spain, 70,000 people turned out for a demonstration in Barcelona. Events are also expected in Madrid and Lisbon, Portugal, the AP said. Officials in Greece are expecting protests in Athens on Saturday and Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, Hamas said in a statement Friday that it agreed to parts of a ceasefire deal President Trump\u00a0outlined earlier this week. A U.S. official told CBS News that the United States views Hamas' response as positive, though there are still details that need to be hammered out. Netanyahu agreed to the deal on Monday. After Hamas released its statement, Mr. Trump said on\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0that he believes the group is \"ready for a lasting PEACE\" and pushed Israel to \"immediately stop the bombing of Gaza.\"",

      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",

      "One of the largest tombs in Egypt's Valley of the Kings reopened to visitors after more than 20 years of renovation.",
      "The huge tomb of Amenhotep III, who ruled ancient Egypt between 1390 B.C. and 1350 B.C., is carved into the hillside on the west bank of the Nile River near the southern Egyptian city of Luxor. It was discovered in 1799 by two people, and its contents were looted, including the sarcophagus, Egyptian antiquities authorities said.",
      "It has been under a Japanese-led, three-phased restoration project for the past two decades, including renovating paintings of the pharaoh and his wife on the tomb walls, said Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.",
      "\"It's a very fascinating tomb,\" he told The Associated Press at the scene, adding that it includes a frame of the stolen sarcophagus box, with the lid in place where it would have been.",
      "The tomb starts with a 118-foot-long, 45-foot-deep, downward-sloping passageway beneath the Valley of the Kings. It includes a main burial chamber for the king, and two other chambers for his wives, Queens Tiye and Sitamun.",
      "Unlike other ancient tombs in the valley, the tomb is not fully decorated, Ismail said. Its paintings show Amenhotep III with a group of ancient Egyptian gods, and the burial chamber contains inscriptions of scenes from the Book of Dead, which is a collection of spells aimed at directing the dead through the underworld in ancient Egypt.",
      "The mummy of Amenhotep III was moved by ancient priests to the tomb of his grandfather, Amenhotep II, also in the Valley of the Kings, according to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization. The severely damaged mummy is showcased at the museum along with 16 other mummies of 17 kings and queens of ancient Egypt.",
      "Amenhotep III was one of the most prominent pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt, which ruled between 1550 B.C. and 1292 B.C. Known as Amenhotep the Great, he ascended the throne as a teenager and ruled for up to 38 years, according to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization.",
      "The tomb's reopening came less than a month before the official inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum near the Giza Pyramids. The museum is scheduled to open on Nov. 1.",
      "The reopenings are part of Egypt's efforts to attract more foreign visitors to revive the tourism sector, a major source of foreign currency. Tourism, which depends heavily on Egypt's rich pharaonic artifacts, suffered a long downturn after the political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising.",

The latter could be considered a bigger accomplishment during such uncertain times, but the mystery of Finland's happiness eludes many, including the Finns themselves.",
      "The World Happiness Report\u00a0is an annual report published by the University of Oxford in partnership with Gallup and the United Nations.",
      "\"People were going to the survey and trying to figure out, what is wrong with the survey,\" explained Frank Martela, a philosopher and professor.",
      "Martela, who this year published \"Stop Chasing Happiness: a pessimist's guide to a good life,\" believes the Finns were skeptical because of the way happiness is measured.",
      "\"I guess like one key reason is what they are actually measuring in this World Happiness Report,\" Martela said.",
      "The report ranks a nation's happiness based on one question: On a scale of zero to 10, how close is your life to the best possible life?",
      "\"Which is a different question than, you know, did you experience joy today, or did you smile or laugh today?\" Martela said.",
      "Meaningful happiness, in the case of the Finns, really comes down to contentment, which begs the question, why are Finns so content?",
      "\"The kind of society we have has been able to take care of the citizens relatively well,\" Martela explained.",

      "\"The idea is to make sure everybody has opportunity to do this kind of thing no matter how much money you yourself have,\" Martela said.",

      "\"This is one of the great things about Helsinki, you're never too far from the natural environment,\" he said.",
      "Another possible explanation for the country's happiness could be its citizens' relationship with temperature. Finland has more saunas per person than the U.S. has passenger cars.",
      "Carita Harju, co-author of \"The Power of Hot and Cold,\" explained that she uses the sauna every day for health benefits as much as the mental ones. After heating up, she takes a dip in the chilly Baltic Sea. The quick temperature changes release endorphins, but for Harju, it's about relaxation.",
      "Which brings back around what happiness really means for Finnish people, and why the country has dominated World Happiness charts for nearly a decade.",
      "\"I guess, like we have been given this unique life to live, and it would be like quite sad if you only followed external pressures on doing things that other people want,\" Martela said, \"like living somebody else's dream instead of our own dream.\"",

      "The Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has attracted a wide range of Americans for a variety of reasons but, most recently, one of the nation's foremost animal rights groups, PETA, has teamed up with the Trump administration and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to push one of its latest initiatives.",

The initiative also includes policies to support the rehousing of animals used in scientific research.",
      "\"We've been working with NIH to give them background information on areas of disease research where the animal experiments have failed so tremendously, and there's the most potential to really shift the game over to human-relevant methods,\" Emily Trunnell, director of science advancement and outreach at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told Fox News Digital. \"About a month ago, we sent them these seven horrific grants \u2026 anybody could look at the things they're doing to like monkeys and dogs and just be like, there's no way taxpayers need to be funding this. So we continue to push them in that way. We are supportive and providing help where we're asked, and we do think they're going in the right direction.\"",

      "The issue of using animals in biomedical research is also one championed by the White Coat Waste Project, which was a vehement critic of Dr. Anthony Fauci and the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic and was also founded on a mission to help end taxpayer-funded experiments on animals. The group, founded by Republican political strategist Anthony Bellotti, told Fox News Digital that it is \"thrilled that the Trump administration is putting wasteful animal experiments we\u2019ve exposed under the microscope.\"",
      "Goodman added that their polling shows 85% of Americans, including Republicans, Democrats and Independents, oppose using taxpayer dollars to support experiments on dogs, cats, and other animals.",
      "Trunnell agreed, noting that she thinks the issue has gained Republican support because many Americans \u2013 no matter their political stripe \u2013 have come to wonder why tax dollars are going towards these \"cruel\" and often less reliable research methods.",
      "\"There's better science when you're using non-animal methods, there's less animal cruelty, and there's less waste all around,\" she told Fox News.",

      "The logo of the international non-governmental animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is seen above. (Yann Schreiber/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "According to Trunnell, Americans have been \"sold this lie that animal research is critical for medical advances.\" For example, she cited that 95% of new drugs tested on animals ultimately fail in human trials, either because they are not safe, potentially due to toxicity not detected in animals, or they're ineffective.",
      "Trunnell added that the majority of animals are used in \"curiosity-driven research,\" which she argued \"never results in anything meaningful for human health.\"",
      "\"On the other hand, we have these new technologies that use human data and human cells,\" Trunnell pointed out.",
      "Trump's head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Dr. Marty Makary, reportedly met with PETA representatives in July after NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya announced the agency would be taking steps to reduce its reliance on animal-based research models and prioritize human-based ones, according to Politico. Bhattacharya's actions allegedly earned him a bouquet of flowers from PETA, which said after his announcement that the group was \"popping\" champagne corks.",

      "\"Whether through AI-driven models, organoid technology, or other innovative tools, we\u2019re seeing a shift toward safer, more ethical, and more efficient methods of testing,\" Nixon said. \"This is an issue that bridges ideology because it\u2019s about modernizing science while aligning it with our values.\""

      "Mac malware often hides in the background, making it hard to spot at first. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Signs your Mac might be infected",
      "Spotting malware on macOS is not always straightforward. Many threats are designed to stay hidden, running quietly in the background while collecting data or opening a backdoor for attackers. Still, there are a few red flags that usually signal something is wrong.",
      "One of the first signs is slower performance or frequent overheating. If your Mac suddenly takes a long time to boot, runs hot during light tasks or lags when performing simple actions, it might be doing more behind the scenes than you realize. Apps that crash or freeze more often than usual are another warning sign. Occasional app failures are normal, but if built-in tools like Safari, Notes or Mail begin acting unstable, it may point to malicious interference.",
      "It is also worth paying attention to what is happening under the hood. Checking Activity Monitor for unknown processes or unusually high CPU or memory usage can reveal malware that tries to hide itself with random or unfamiliar names. Redirected web traffic is another classic symptom. If your browser takes you to strange websites, shows pop-ups, or installs new extensions you never approved, adware or spyware might already be present.",
      "Finally, unexplained changes to your security settings should always raise suspicion. If you notice your firewall turned off, privacy permissions modified, or login items appearing without your knowledge, something could have gained unauthorized control of your system.",

      "Apple has built several layers of defense into macOS, many of which run silently in the background to keep your system secure. Knowing how they work can help you understand what protections are already in place and where you might still need to add more safeguards.",
      "Gatekeeper is one of the most important built-in security tools. It checks every app before it runs to make sure it comes from a verified developer, warning or blocking you if the app is not trusted. Another layer of defense is XProtect, Apple's built-in malware scanner. It updates automatically and can stop many known threats from running, although it is not as thorough as specialized antivirus software.",
      "System Integrity Protection, or SIP, is another important safeguard. It locks down critical system files and processes so that malware cannot tamper with them even if it gains access. macOS also uses sandboxing and strict permission controls to contain threats. Apps run in isolated environments and must explicitly request permission to access sensitive data such as your camera, files, or location.",
      "Together, these features make it significantly harder for malicious software to infect your Mac or cause serious damage. However, they are not perfect. Attackers are constantly developing new techniques to bypass these protections, and many threats rely on human error rather than technical exploits. That is why taking additional precautions is still essential, even on a Mac.",

The study found that only eight of 47 safety features tested were fully effective, and internal documents suggest that Meta was aware of some shortcomings. Critics also argued that certain protections, like manual comment-hiding, place the burden on teens themselves rather than preventing harm upfront. They questioned whether time management tools were robust enough, giving some features middling grades despite functioning as described.",

The online safety curriculum goes one step further by teaching kids how to recognize threats and respond confidently. Still, advocacy groups and independent researchers question whether these efforts are enough, and Meta's strong defense shows just how high the stakes are in the teen safety debate. As teens spend more of their lives online, the responsibility to protect them grows. The real test will be how well these tools hold up against evolving online threats.",

      "Cybercriminals continue to find new ways to target social media users, and Meta accounts remain one of the most common lures. Losing access to Facebook or Instagram can have real consequences for both individuals and businesses, making people more likely to fall for urgent security warnings. Attackers exploit this by sending convincing notifications that pressure you into taking quick action without thinking.",

      "Cybercriminals are targeting Facebook and Instagram accounts by sending fake security warnings. (Fox News)",
      "How the FileFix attack works",
      "As reported by researchers at Acronis,\u00a0a leading cybersecurity and data protection company, the attack begins with a phishing page that looks like a message from Meta's support team, claiming that your account will be disabled in seven days unless you view an \"incident report.\" Instead of providing an actual document, the page disguises a malicious PowerShell command as a file path.",
      "Victims are instructed to copy it, open File Explorer, and paste it into the address bar. While it appears harmless, this action secretly runs code that starts the malware infection process.",
      "This method is part of a family of attacks known as ClickFix, where people are tricked into pasting commands into system dialogs. FileFix, created by Red Team researcher mr.d0x, builds on that idea by exploiting the File Explorer address bar instead. In this campaign, the attackers improved the trick by hiding the malicious command behind long strings of spaces, so only the fake file path is visible to the victim.",
      "A hidden script then downloads what looks like a JPG image from Bitbucket, but the file contains embedded code. Once executed, it extracts another script and decrypts the final payload, bypassing many security tools in the process.",

      "FileFix sends out fake alerts urging users to review their account security. (Acronis)",
      "What StealC tries to steal",
      "The malware delivered by this campaign is StealC, an infostealer that collects a wide range of personal and organizational data. It is designed to grab browser credentials and authentication cookies from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and other browsers.",
      "It also targets messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Pidgin, along with cryptocurrency wallets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Exodus. StealC goes further by attempting to compromise cloud accounts from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, VPN services like ProtonVPN and even gaming accounts from Battle.net and Ubisoft. In addition, it can take screenshots of the victim's desktop, giving attackers a live view of sensitive activity.",
      "Acronis reported that the campaign has already appeared in several different versions over a short period, with changes in payloads and infrastructure. This suggests that the attackers are actively testing and refining their methods to avoid detection and improve success rates.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from FileFix attacks",
      "To stay protected against attacks like FileFix and prevent malware such as StealC from stealing sensitive information, you need to combine caution with practical security measures. The following steps can help safeguard accounts, devices, and personal data.",
      "Attackers rely on panic. Treat any message claiming your Meta account or other services will be disabled within days with caution. Verify the alert directly through official platforms rather than clicking links or following instructions from an email or web page.",
      "FileFix relies on convincing you to paste hidden PowerShell commands disguised as file paths. Never paste commands into system dialogs, File Explorer, or terminals unless you are absolutely certain of their origin.",
      "FileFix and StealC thrive on the information they can extract from a device or linked accounts. By using data removal services, you reduce the amount of sensitive personal information that can be found online or left exposed on old platforms. This minimizes what attackers can exploit if they manage to gain access.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A strong antivirus software can detect malware like StealC before it fully executes. Many solutions now include behavior-based detection that can flag suspicious scripts or hidden downloads, helping catch threats even when attackers try to disguise commands as harmless actions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

A fake Meta alert may feel urgent, but pausing before you click or copy anything is the best defense. Relying on strong habits and security tools gives you the upper hand. Data removal services, antivirus software, and password managers each reduce risk in different ways.

Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The fact that Chrome has already faced six zero-day attacks this year shows how relentless attackers are and how even the most popular software can have serious gaps. These flaws are not just bugs, but opportunities for hackers to exploit millions of users before fixes roll out. The pattern also highlights the growing sophistication of threat actors, including state-backed groups targeting high-risk individuals. No browser is completely safe, and the battle to secure widely used software is ongoing and far from over.",

      "Last week, Cammila Wamsley, director of Portland\u2019s ICE office, said the facility has endured more than 100 straight nights of violence, with Portland police largely absent under direction from the mayor and City Council.",
      "\"It\u2019s frustrating for us to watch people be attacked on the street and know that we don\u2019t have the authority to be able to really step in unless there\u2019s some nexus to federal law,\" Wamsley said.",
      "She added that nightly protests have escalated beyond changes and signs, with bottle rockets striking the ICE building, rocks shattering windows, lasers targeting officers\u2019 eyes and barricades blocking vehicles.",

      "Despite these accounts, Day offered a very different picture in an opinion piece published by The Oregonian on Sunday, arguing that national media coverage of Portland and its police paint a misleading and outdated picture.",
      "Day said he is \"deeply proud\" of how Portlanders show up for one another continuously and equally proud of his police department.",
      "\"Unfortunately, national portrayals often distort reality. Portland is 145 square miles, yet one city block has drawn outsized attention in news cycles. Viral clips \u2014 sometimes months or years old \u2014 paint a picture that is not consistent with the Portland we see every day,\" Day wrote. \"While this is frustrating, we are focused on what matters: keeping Portlanders safe.\"",

      "Regarding protests at the federal building, Day said his officers are making arrests and pursuing prosecutions.",
      "\"It\u2019s important to note that the Federal Protective Service secures the building itself, while Portland Police manages the surrounding neighborhoods,\" he said. \"Recently, we have seen people with varying viewpoints come to the area with the intent to engage in violence and we are investigating several assaults; violence of any kind is unacceptable \u2013 we have and will continue to make arrests and pursue prosecutions. Free speech does not include freedom to commit crimes.\"",
      "\"There are also those who want to draw parallels about current events and 2020, when 100-plus nights of protests deeply impacted the city and Portland Police. But this isn\u2019t 2020 for many reasons,\" Day continued. \"Since I became chief two years ago, I have witnessed significant change. Reforms in use of force, crowd management and accountability have reshaped how we operate.",
      "\"As we have shown with the numerous massive protests that have occurred this year, large demonstrations can occur peacefully, and when disturbances arise, we take targeted action that can quickly restore order,\" he continued. \"Five years ago, some city and state leadership left the police bureau isolated. Today, that has changed. The bureau is part of a united statewide effort, backed by strong leadership from the mayor, city council, city administrator, governor, our congressional delegation and fellow Portlanders.\"",

      "\"One of the reasons given for this action has been that Portland Police are not responding to public disorder,\" Day wrote. \"Just because officers are not seen wearing tactical gear lining up before crowds does not mean we are not responding. In fact, research shows that such tactics often escalate crowd behavior.\"",

      "\"Our focus has shifted from \u2018crowd control\u2019 to \u2018crowd support,\u2019 with an emphasis on outreach, preparation and communication,\" Day said. \"We now use evidence-based policing and crowd psychology in managing large public gatherings. These innovations have helped us connect with communities in new ways, already paying dividends in safer, more respectful demonstrations.\"",
      "Day closed his essay on an optimistic note, urging Portlanders to focus on civic engagement and community service.",
      "\"Rather than focusing on what cannot be done, this is an opportunity to channel that energy into action \u2014 through volunteering, community service or civic engagement,\" he continued. \"Turning dissonance into action is far more productive.

      "He has since worked to \"demonize cities where Democrats had been elected as leaders\" and provoked unrest in the state by surging federal law enforcement to target undocumented immigrants and protesters outside an immigration detention facility in the suburb of Broadview, the suit says.",
      "\"Among other things, Trump and Noem have sent a surge of SWAT-tactic trained federal agents to Illinois to use unprecedented, brute force tactics for civil immigration enforcement; federal agents have repeatedly shot chemical munitions at groups that included media and legal observers outside the Broadview facility; and dozens of masked, armed federal agents have paraded through downtown Chicago in a show of force and control,\" the suit says.",
      "\"The community\u2019s horror at these tactics and their significant consequences have resulted in entirely foreseeable protests,\" it adds.",

      "\"We have a negotiation going on right now with the Democrats that could lead to very good things. And I'm talking about good things with regard to health care,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "Asked specifically whether he's speaking to Democratic leaders, Trump replied: \"I don't want to say that. But we are speaking with the Democrats. But some very good things could happen with respect to health care.\"",

      "The booming IV hydration spa industry operates with virtually no oversight or data backing up its claims, according to the first comprehensive national analysis of hydration clinics.",
      "At clinics nationwide, people pay hundreds of dollars to have vitamins and minerals dripped directly into their veins as a detox, to ease headaches or boost immunity, \u201calmost completely without evidence,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest and co-author of the study, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. \u201cAs a result, there\u2019s a real danger to consumers.\u201d",
      "Hydration clinics, combined with the growing number of med spas offering intravenous vitamin drips, skin care and cosmetic procedures, have ballooned into a $15 billion wellness industry in recent years, according to the American Med Spa Association.",
      "The group represents med spas, which often offer IV treatments, nationwide. Alex Thiersch, chief executive officer of the American Med Spa Association, said some IV hydration clinic providers don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re actually practicing medicine and may lack proper training.",
      "\u201cWe have had folks who are surprised by that,\u201d Thiersch said. \u201cThey thought, \u2018I\u2019m just doing an IV. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s vitamins.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re putting a needle in someone\u2019s vein,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s 100% medical practice.\u201d",
      "There are no federal health regulations or national standards for procedures for med spas. Instead, the facilities fall under the authority of each state.",
      "As of June 2024, no state or jurisdiction had enacted legislation specifically to regulate IV hydration spas, according to the new study.",
      "Thirty-two states did have some kind of policy addressing IV hydration spas, including rules either for prescribing or  compounding drugs or how clinics should dispense medications.",
      "Four states \u2014 Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Vermont \u2014 had the most comprehensive oversight.",
      "\u201cThis is a medical system that exists largely outside of conventional medicine,\u201d Lurie said. \u201cWe\u2019re worried that people will spend their money on these without reason to expect benefits. We\u2019re also worried that there will be adverse effects related to this.\u201d",
      "The potential for injury is real: Products or equipment could be contaminated, or a provider might not have appropriate training to give an IV safely.",
      "There\u2019s no official count of the number of people injured at med spas. Infections and allergic reactions aren\u2019t often reported to health departments.",
      "The new research cited NBC News\u2019 previous reporting on med spas as evidence of \u201crising concerns of their safety, with reports of infections and contaminated products.\u201d",
      "Of 255 clinic websites analyzed, more than half offered IV hydration therapy touting therapies like magnesium for headaches and muscle cramps, glutathione as a potential immune system booster, or other substances advertised to increase energy.",
      "Just two of those sites listed tangible sources for those health claims. None mentioned potential risks, like infection or allergic reactions.",
      "One aspect of the research involved a secret shopper investigation, in which researchers placed calls to 87 randomly chosen spas.",
      "Only about 1 in 4 required a medical consultation beforehand. More than 85% recommended specific IV cocktails when callers mentioned symptoms like a headache or cold, often without verifying a patient\u2019s medical history.",
      "Fewer than 1 in 4 warned about potential side effects, like bruising or infections.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration previously warned consumers about the potential for severe infections and skin deformities from unauthorized shots touted to dissolve fat at med spas."

      "\"At the time, I was Rocky Maivia, and it wasn\u2019t going well. I was getting booed. These guys? Fighting for Pride in Japan and making real money. I remember saying to Mark, \u2018Hey man, if I ever want to talk to you about this stuff, is that okay?\u2019 He said, \u2018Absolutely.\u2019 I was a jabroni, and he was like, \u2018Good for you, kid,'\" Johnson recalled.",

If your child is happy, healthy and thriving, then you are kicking a--, Mama. Don\u2019t listen to what anybody else has to say online ... moms are awesome.\u201d"

      "\u201cSo, it\u2019s like your simple syrup and your grenadine and your pineapple juice and orange juice and there\u2019s your mocktail,\u201d Burtka explains. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel special. I felt like a kid.\u201d",
      "To remedy that, Burtka and Harris, a mixologist in his own right, began experimenting with various recipes, creating personalized versions of their favorite drinks. The result is \u201cBoth Sides of the Glass: Paired Cocktails and Mocktails to Toast Any Taste,\u201d a new book that features cocktail and mocktail recipes.",
      "\u201cWe think this was a good opportunity to share some recipes that we\u2019ve made and to create some more recipes that balanced and complemented each other so that you could enjoy the same experience whether you were drinking alcohol or not,\u201d Harris says of their collaboration.",
      "Along with its premise of offering both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, the book is also unique in that it divides its drink recipes into four distinct categories: Water, fire, air and earth.",
      "In the introduction of the book, Harris and Burtka explain why.",
      "\u201cSo much of enjoying a cocktail if filling out the mood \u2014 it\u2019s the companion to that rainy afternoon, or the perfect addition to that sexy date night \u2014 that we decided to organize it by elements.",
      "\u201cTo us, drinks have a mood or a feeling to them, and this felt like the best way for us to think about them,\u201d they pen in the book.",
      "\u2018I Wanted to Feel Like an Adult\u2019",
      "Among the various concoctions are tried-and-true favorites like the Mai Tai, margarita and old fashioned, as well as quirkier drinks like the Penicillin, a blend of scotch, ginger and honey, and  its non-alcoholic companion, the Antibiotic.",
      "There\u2019s even a Shirley Temple, but it's \u201cfor adults\u201d and aptly named the Dirty Shirley.",
      "The refined drinks, says Burtka, help take old-school mocktails to the next level. \u201cI wanted to feel like an adult. I didn\u2019t want to feel like a kid,\u201d he explains.",
      "Both Harris and Burtka agree that of all the various beverages in the book, they\u2019re partial to the negronis.",
      "\u201cIf you drink any kind of burnt orange bitter flavor before dinner, it opens up your palate,\u201d says Burtka, a professional chef. \u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of people have a negroni spritz \u2014 so they can open up the palate, so the food tastes even more delicious.\u201d",
      "I wanted to feel like an adult. I didn\u2019t want to feel like a kid.",
      "David Burtka on \"Both Sides of the Glass\"",
      "Harris says their decision to make the book was inspired by Zo\u00eb Chapin, a friend who proposed the idea after noting that there were cocktail and mocktail books, respectively, but not one that combined both.",
      "\u201cWe thought that\u2019s kind of a cool idea,\u201d the \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d star says. More than that, he and Burtka realized it was the perfect gift for other people in situations like their own.",
      "\u201cWhether they do drink or not, you don\u2019t want to be disrespectful, so it\u2019s kind of a cool gift,\u201d Harris explains.",
      "As parents to their fraternal 15-year-old twins, Harper and Gideon, the pair says that the mocktails in the book are also great for kids who want to feel included among the adults, despite being too young to drink alcohol.",
      "\u201cYou want to sort of share the same experience,\u201d Harris says. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re doing a Thanksgiving, you\u2019re having cocktails before, it\u2019s nice for the kids to even enjoy as well, let your kids be special.\u201d",
      "\u2018Black Magic Margarita\u2019",
      "Included in their collection of cocktails is the Black Magic Marg, one of Harris' signature drinks blended from blackberries and tequila, as well as its non-alcoholic mate, the Black Magic Moment.",
      "The drinks are a nod to the couple's well-known passion for Halloween. Famous for their legendary costumes, Harris, Burtka and their kids have made headlines throughout the years with many of their over-the-top looks.",
      "\u201cWe love Halloween and every year we look forward to it,\u201d says Harris. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s tricky. Every year as the kids get older, the dynamic shifts. We love trick-or-treating. Our kids are in high school now. If they go to try and trick-or-treat, everyone at the door is like, \u201cUh, aren\u2019t you a bit old for this now?\u201d he laughs.",
      "Their Halloween plans will look a bit different this year, though, since Harris is currently appearing on Broadway in \u201cArt,\u201d a comedy co-starring James Corden and Bobby Cannavale, and has a performance on Oct. 31.",
      "Even so, he and Burtka are still cooking up something to celebrate the spooky holiday.",
      "\u201cWe have a Halloween costume for Instagram that I think everyone\u2019s agreed on,\u201d Harris teases. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky because you have to do a costume that will fit one girl and three boys that will not embarrass the two of them.\u201d",
      "Though they won\u2019t reveal exactly what they\u2019ve settled on, Harris does mention how much thought has gone into it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of overthinking,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think we found something that\u2019s awesome.\u201d"

Afterward, Nikki turned to alcohol to cope with her pain.",

      "As the film depicts, following his UFC wins, Kerr headed to Japan to compete in the MMA promotion Pride Fighting Championships. According to the UFC, Kerr won six of his first eight fights in Pride as a heavyweight.",
      "He did have his losses, which are seen in the movie, that also triggered his health struggles. One fight in particular, against Igor Vovchanchyn, ended in a no-contest, which set him over the edge.",
      "\"That was the straw that literally set me over the top,\" Kerr told Johnson in a joint interview for Sports Illustrated.",
      "Amid his success in the ring, his life behind closed doors proved to be quite the opposite.",
      "His Struggles With Addiction and Overdose",
      "As depicted in the film, Kerr struggled with addiction and took painkillers that were prescribed to him by a doctor. He began using opioids regularly to be able to continue fighting and numb the blows in the ring.",
      "In a 2024 interview on the HJR Podcast, Kerr explained when he believes his addiction started.",
      "\u201cThe two components that came together are the expectation that I\u2019m supposed to perform at this level regardless,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the training to perform at that level. And when those two came together, it just created a storm where I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t have time.\u201d",

      "Whether it's Dawn making the wrong smoothie, Mark not inviting her to go to Japan for his tournaments or both dealing with his addiction recovery, the two pushed each other's buttons.",
      "The film also depicted a the real-life moment when Dawn attempted to kill herself with a gun after Mark told her to leave their home. Kerr confirmed the moment in his HBO documentary, as well as in an interview with Time.com, sharing that Staples also attempted to hurt herself with razors before grabbing the handgun.",
      "\u201cWhat I was doing at the time was incredibly selfish. Dawn just wanted my love. She wanted to feel important. The only thing important at the time was me fighting, then the second thing that came in importance was the drug and alcohol use,\u201d Kerr said about his and Staples fights. \u201cA lot of that volatility was because of my actions. I look back on it now, she\u2019s a little girl asking to be loved, and I\u2019m just a little boy that doesn\u2019t know how to accept or give it.\u201d",
      "The two would go on to get married, have a son, Bryce, together, before divorcing in 2006.",

      "\u201cIt was therapy for me... For the first time, I could actually see my part in it,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I could see my part, how f------ hard I was on the people around me, how just singularly driven I was to accomplish something at all cost. And the person that paid it the most was Dawn. She paid a heavy price.\u201d",
      "In another interview with IndieWire, Kerr reflected on his and his ex-wife's relationship.",
      "\u201cIt allowed me to see how hard I was on Dawn, and really admit that to myself,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cFighting is incredibly selfish; it doesn\u2019t leave a lot of space for other people when it comes to emotion and intimacy. Breaking it down to its essence, Dawn was just a little girl who wanted to be loved, and I was just a boy that couldn\u2019t figure out how to love her.\u201d",
      "He expressed that both of them are different people now and their priority in life is their \u201cbeautiful 20-year-old son\u201d and \u201cto be the best parents we can to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the movie showed at Venice, I couldn\u2019t believe how emotionally impactful it was,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was like therapy with a thousand people in the room. It was a beautiful experience.\u201d",

      "Bad Bunny continued his impassioned speech about the movie, which caused even more tension at the table. Fineman attempted to diffuse the situation, but the rapper refused to participate in the conversation, turning away from the group with his arms folded across his chest.",
      "While his friends talked about what had transpired over the last few years, Bad Bunny\u2019s internal monologue took center stage.",
      "\u201cThose dumb idiots have no idea. Stupid dummies. I don\u2019t care if they believe me, I have HUNTR/X on my side,\u201d he said in a voiceover, before singers Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami \u2014 who sang the vocals for the group in \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d \u2014 appeared in a thought bubble and began to sing.",

      "While Fineman went to share more about her life, Bad Bunny returned to his internal monologue, even angrier than before.",
      "When he was snapped back to reality, Fineman confessed to her recent blunder. Bad Bunny seemed shocked by the news initially, but in actuality, he was reacting to Bowen Yang entering as the demon Jinu from the movie.",
      "Equipped with a microphone and his greatest weapon, \u201ca voice,\u201d Yang possessed Sherman and the group devolved into pure panic. Day immediately apologized to Bad Bunny for doubting him while Fineman asked for help.",

      "Cillian Murphy weighed in on why he thinks it's important for actors to be known for their work and not necessarily their personality.",
      "In a preview clip for the Oct. 5 \"Sunday Sitdown With Willie Geist,\" the Academy Award-winning actor spoke with Sunday TODAY anchor about why he doesn't seem too interested in becoming a celebrity.",
      "\"One of the things I admire about you, Cillian, is your complete disinterest in being a celebrity or a movie star,\" Willie said while laughing. \"And that you\u2019re an actor and you wanna be known for your work, and you\u2019ve pulled that off.\"",
      "Willie then asked Murphy why it was important for people not to know too much about him personally.",
      "\"I\u2019ve always felt that if you wanna try and inhabit somebody convincingly that it seems sensible that there wouldn\u2019t be too much \u2014 that people wouldn\u2019t have an impression of you as an individual that would in some way inhibit your ability to do that,\" Murphy said.",
      "\"That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve always felt,\" he continued. \"I like the transformative nature of acting. So if you can kinda keep that as background, then I think it allows you more freedom as a performer, you know?\"",
      "Murphy made a name for himself in roles like Christopher Nolan's  \"Batman Begins\" and \"Inception,\" and the popular series \"Peaky Blinders.\" When he landed the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in Nolan's epic film, \"Oppenheimer,\" he not took home an Oscar, but also became more of a household name.",
      "The three-hour film won seven Oscars, including the Academy Award for best picture and Murphy's Oscar for best actor in a leading role.",
      "Since the release of \"Oppenheimer,\" Murphy has gone on to star in the Zombie movie, \"28 Days Later,\" and \"Small Things Like These,\" a film adaptation of Irish author Claire Keegan's book of the same name.",
      "That film follows an Irish father in the 1980s as he discovers abuse occurring at a local convent's Magdalene Laundry. At laundries across the country, \"fallen women\" were forced into unpaid labor until the last laundry closed in 1996, according to the BBC.",
      "Murphy described learning of the scandal as a \"collective trauma for people of a certain age\" at a 2024 press conference, according to the Guardian.",
      "\u201cI think the irony of the book is that it\u2019s a Christian man trying to act Christian in a dysfunctional Christian society. And it asks a lot of questions about publicity and silence and shame, all of those things,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think the duty of art is to answer those questions, it\u2019s to talk to them. And maybe it\u2019s easier to absorb than an academic report, or a political report.\u201d",
      "Murphy's newest role is in Netflix's \"Steve,\" in which he portrays the titular role of a headteacher at a school for boys with societal and behavioral issues. \"Steve\" is set to premiere on Oct. 3."

      "\"I really think we\u2019re going to have a deal. We have a really good chance of making a deal, and it will be a lasting deal,\" President Donald Trump told reporters at a media gathering Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing Monday that Witkoff and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner were holding talks with \"their respective parties from all sides.\"",
      "\"The president wants to see a ceasefire. He wants to see the hostages released, and the technical teams are discussing that as we speak to ensure that the environment is perfect to release those hostages,\" Leavitt said. \"They\u2019re going over the lists of both the Israeli hostages and also the political prisoners who will be released. And those talks are underway, and the president is very much on the ball and is being apprised of this situation.\"",
      "On the anniversary eve of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, and subsequent military operation by Israel, representatives from all sides arrived in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to discuss a 20-point peace plan tabled by Trump to halt the conflict.",

      "Witkoff and Kushner traveled to Egypt to help hammer out the deal\u2019s remaining sticking points, a senior White House official told NBC News on Saturday.",
      "Trump called the talks \"very successful, and proceeding rapidly,\" and said Monday\u2019s meetings was just a case of technical teams clarifying \"final details.\" He wrote in a social media post that \"the first phase should be completed this week.\"",
      "Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian American mediator, said in an interview that Hamas leaders were optimistic about the prospects of arriving at an agreement and feel specifically reassured by Trump's recent comments. They believe Trump is the only person who can pressure Netanyahu into a deal, Bahbah added.",

      "It came as Israel said it deported 171 activists, including the campaigner Greta Thunberg, who sailed toward Gaza on an aid flotilla. The detainees, whose vessels were boarded by Israeli military personnel, were deported to Greece and Slovakia, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement.",
      "The first phase of the talks will deal with the release of the remaining 48 hostages, some 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.",
      "The plan also calls for the end of fighting and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hamas agreed to some of this proposal Friday, while sidestepping Trump\u2019s call for it to disband and disarm.",
      "On Sunday, Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi denied as baseless reports in Arab media that the group had agreed to lay down its weapons.",
      "Israel says it agrees with the plan, buoying the yearslong, impassioned domestic campaign by families and supporters of the hostages to cease fighting so they can be brought home.",
      "Ohad Ben Ami, 56, was released in February, having been kidnapped from kibbutz Be\u2019eri, in southern Israel, and held captive for 491 days. On Sunday, he showed NBC News the place where he was taken on Oct. 7.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Despite being headlined by a genuine star and staged at one of London\u2019s premier theaters, a play about the foundation of a sprawling and troubled public service seemed unlikely to provoke night after night of standing ovations.",
      "But that\u2019s what happened with \u201cNye,\u201d an unlikely hit about the creator, and origin story, of Britain\u2019s taxpayer-funded National Health Service.",
      "The play, written by Tim Price and directed by Rufus Norris, came at an inflection point for the NHS, as it\u2019s known. Almost 80 years after it was founded, the medical service once touted as the envy of the world is \u201cbroken\u201d and suffering the \u201cbiggest crisis in its history,\u201d the government says. The crisis at this national bedrock is part of a bigger malaise at the heart of British culture: rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m terrified, not just for the NHS, but for the whole of our society,\u201d Michael Sheen, who starred as Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, the founder of the NHS, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cOnce it\u2019s torn down, then I guess people will think about what they\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "Sheen, 56, better known to international audiences as Tony Blair in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d David Frost in \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d and the angel Aziraphale in the Amazon Prime series \u201cGood Omens,\u201d has spent much of the last two years honing his portrayal of Bevan, the socialist politician who dragged himself out of Wales\u2019 coal mines to will the NHS into existence.",
      "Though second nature to Brits, the ideal of the NHS is unfamiliar to many Americans: British people have universally free health care at the point of access \u2014 from ambulances attending car accidents to insulin for diabetes to cancer care to childbirth. Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.",
      "Now, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.",
      "Through all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)",
      "But just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.",
      "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d",
      "Though the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight for the NHS, the same as the NHS was fought for when it was created,\u201d said Ferris\u2019 mother, Caroline Heggie, 70, a hospital union representative, who like her daughter had come to see the last night of \u201cNye\u201d at the National Theater last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t go the way of privatization, we can\u2019t go the way of America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d",
      "Like Bevan, Sheen is a Welsh firebrand unafraid to wear his leftist politics. But he also lived for 14 years in Los Angeles, so knows too well what life is like without socialized health care.",
      "\u201cThe idea of this health care system that we have here, just seemed so alien to them over there,\u201d Sheen, who now lives back in his Welsh hometown of Port Talbot, says of his former American hosts. He says that \u201cseeing people go into hospitals with serious injuries or illnesses, and being asked to produce their checkbook before they can be treated\u201d would shock most Britons.",
      "The crisis at the NHS coincides with an uptick in hostility toward immigrants \u2014 even though they are often people\u2019s doctors, nurses and hospital cleaners. Almost 20% of NHS staff have a non-British nationality, with Indians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Irish and Poles making up most of their number.",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform U.K. party and an ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading some polls to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. He has become the first prospective leader to question the funding model of using taxes to fund the NHS \u2014 historically taboo.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Farage told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in May. \u201cWe\u2019re getting worse bang for the buck than any other country, particularly out of those European neighbors.\u201d",
      "Opposing Farage\u2019s proposal, however, leaves open the specter of privatization, which many say has been creeping up even before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 opened up the NHS to bids from private contractors.",
      "Farage isn\u2019t the only person dissatisfied. Indeed, the NHS has slipped from being a world leader on many metrics.",
      "\u201cCorridor care\u201d is now a year-round crisis, and the number of people waiting 12 hours or more to be admitted into an emergency room rose from 47 in summer 2015 to 74,150 this summer. Targets have lagged for years in everything from ambulance attendance times to cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, a 7 million-strong waiting list means many people feel abandoned for months, in pain, before getting hip or knee replacement and other types of surgery.",
      "There is ample evidence to suggest that economic austerity policies imposed during 14 years of Conservative Party rule are at least partly to blame, according to Max Warner, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London research group.",
      "\u201cIt is true that a lot of NHS performance measures over the 2010s were broadly getting worse, having started off relatively well,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s worth saying that productivity did grow, so it\u2019s a nuanced picture and causality is difficult.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives argued that they kept NHS spending up, protecting it from the brutal cuts that crushed almost every other government department at the time. But this 2% yearly growth still fell well short of the 3.8% yearly average since the 1980s, and, according to critics, was insufficient to cope with an aging population and the rising prices of cutting-edge drugs.",
      "Far from the envy of the world, Britain has been scrimping by spending 37 billion pounds ($53 billion) on the health services each year, well below Germany, France and Australia, a landmark review found last year.",
      "The current Labour government has outlined plans to raise spending to around 3% \u2014 an improvement but still short of what many advocates had hoped. At his annual Labour Party conference this week, Starmer announced that a digital overhaul named NHS Online would launch in 2027, describing it as \u201ca new chapter in the story of our NHS.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, whatever the model, cash is key, according to Roy Lilley, who ran an NHS hospital in the 1990s as chairman of Homewood NHS Trust in Surrey, west of London.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you pay for your health care,\u201d said Lilley, today a consultant whose newsletter hits 300,000 inboxes. \u201cWhether you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018insurance,\u2019 or you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018taxes,\u2019 it\u2019s still your trousers.\u201d",
      "He remains optimistic, however, pointing to some waiting metrics improving and a general recovery from the hammerblow of the pandemic, which drained resources and mentally scarred doctors.",
      "Still, Sheen \u2014 never shy to mix acting with activism \u2014 believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the NHS is in crisis just when its origin story begins to vanish from living memory.",
      "\u201cThe crisis that we seem to be experiencing makes it all the more important to go back to the beginning and to look at what was behind the founding of the NHS, and what the principles were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes incredibly important to tell the story of it and to remind people of what it was actually like, so that we don\u2019t forget.\u201d"

Hamas\u2019 caveat was that \u201cthe field conditions for the exchange are met.\u201d",

      "The Middle East is a part of the world where conflict seems eternal, peace sporadic. Since President Harry Truman recognized the Jewish state in 1948, many presidents have tried to usher in peaceful relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, only to see conflict erupt again and again.",

      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do,\u201d said a former Western diplomat with experience in the Middle East. \u201cHamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases. Trump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019 bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "A European diplomat who has been closely engaged in the process said the situation remained extremely urgent: \u201cGet the hostages home. Worry about the details next.\u201d",
      "The diplomat acknowledged that as with any deal of this kind, the details and terms need to be worked out as the process moves forward.",
      "Even if Trump succeeds where his predecessors failed and creates conditions for Palestinians and Israelis to live together peacefully, a Nobel Peace Prize would still be a long shot.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the Trump administration for launching deadly attacks on alleged foreign drug boats. Though he has embraced the title \u201cPresident of Peace,\u201d Trump just rebranded the Defense Department as the \u201cDepartment of War.\u201d",
      "The prize is awarded each year by five appointees of Norway\u2019s parliament. During Trump\u2019s first term, one member of parliament, Christian Tybring-Gjedde, was at the hairdresser waiting for his wife when his cellphone rang.",
      "Trump was calling.",
      "With the hair dryers whirring, Tybring-Gjedde said he had trouble hearing. The president thanked him for nominating him for the prize, Tybring-Gjedde said in an interview.",
      "Earlier this summer, Trump called another Norwegian, former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and during the conversation also brought up the prize.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure he [Trump] really understands how this is done,\u201d Tybring-Gjedde said. \u201cThe Norwegian government has nothing to do with the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d",
      "A phone call may not sway anyone, but the Nobel judges would be hard-pressed to defy a president who brokered a Middle East peace deal at long last, Trump\u2019s supporters say.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting if he does pull it off how the Nobel committee manages to ignore the fact that he did it,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican ally of the president, told NBC News."

      "Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record who is well known for inspiring rallies of mostly white, mostly male followers shouting soccer-style chants against Islam and immigration, accepted the invitation from Amichai Chikli, Israel\u2019s minister for the diaspora and combating antisemitism.",
      "Chikli called Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 a \u201ccourageous leader on the front line against radical Islam.\u201d",

      "Robinson\u2019s invitation to Israel \u201cundermines those genuinely working to tackle Islamist extremism and foster community cohesion,\u201d the two groups added. \u201cMinister Chikli has proven himself to be a Diaspora Minister in name only.\u201d",

      "Neither Israel\u2019s prime minister\u2019s office nor the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism immediately responded to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Robinson said he had accepted the invitation and that he would travel to Israel \u201cimmediately following my October 13th trial.\u201d",

      "Robinson was first jailed in 2005 for assaulting an off-duty police officer and ordered to do community service in 2011 for leading a brawl involving more than 100 soccer fans. He was imprisoned again in 2013 for traveling to the United States on another person\u2019s passport, then again a year later for mortgage fraud.",

      "During that time, he co-founded the English Defence League, or EDL, which rose out of a disparate network of far-right groups and whose virulently Islamophobic views were praised by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway\u2019s worst peacetime atrocity in July 2011 and has frequently made Nazi salutes when attending court.",

      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Leo urged the world\u2019s 1.4 billion Catholics on Sunday to care for immigrants, pressing ahead with a message of welcome for migrants days after criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line anti-immigration policies.",
      "Leo, the first U.S. pope, told thousands of pilgrims celebrating Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square that immigrants should not be treated with \u201cthe coldness of indifference or the stigma of discrimination.\u201d",
      "The pope, who did not single out any country for its treatment of migrants, called on Catholics to \u201copen our arms and hearts to them, welcoming them as brothers and sisters, and being for them a presence of consolation and hope.\u201d",
      "'New missionary age'",
      "Leo had criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies on September 30, questioning whether they were in line with the Catholic Church\u2019s pro-life teachings, in comments that drew heated backlash from some prominent conservative Catholics.",
      "On Sunday, the pope said the global Church was experiencing \u201ca new missionary age\u201d in which it was tasked with offering \u201chospitality and welcome, compassion and solidarity\u201d to migrants fleeing violence or searching for a safe place to live.",
      "\u201cIn the communities of ancient Christian tradition, such as those of the West, the presence of many brothers and sisters from the world\u2019s South should be welcomed as an opportunity, through an exchange that renews the face of the Church,\u201d he said.",
      "Elected in May to replace the late Pope Francis, Leo has shown a much more reserved style than his predecessor, who frequently criticized the Trump administration and often spoke in surprise, off-the-cuff remarks.",
      "Leo spoke on Sunday from a prepared text. He was addressing a weekend event during the Catholic Church\u2019s ongoing holy year that was specially organised for migrants, which the Vatican said had attracted more than 10,000 pilgrims from some 95 countries."

      "In its statement on Friday, Hamas said that the group \u201caffirms its readiness to immediately enter into negotiations through the mediators to discuss the details of this agreement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe movement also renews its agreement to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and Arab and Islamic support,\u201d Hamas said.",
      "Hamas was responding to a 20-point peace plan Trump outlined on Monday at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Trump and Netanyahu\u2019s office both replied positively to the Hamas statement.",
      "\u201cBased on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE. Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it\u2019s far too dangerous to do that,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cWe are already in discussions on details to be worked out. This is not about Gaza alone, this is about long sought PEACE in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "In a video address posted later on Truth Social, Trump added, \u201cThis is a big day. We\u2019ll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down in concrete.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office also welcomed the Hamas response in a statement on Friday.",
      "\u201cIn light of Hamas\u2019s response, Israel is preparing to immediately implement the first phase of Trump\u2019s plan for the immediate release of all hostages,\u201d the statement said.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to work in full cooperation with the President and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles set forth by Israel that are consistent with President Trump\u2019s vision.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also said in a statement on Telegram that they are taking preliminary steps to prepare for implementing the plan.",
      "\u201cIn accordance with the directives from the political echelon, the Chief of the General Staff instructed to advance readiness for the implementation of the first phase of the Trump plan for the release of the hostages,\u201d the IDF said.",
      "Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, welcomed Trump\u2019s announcement and praised the president\u2019s efforts to end the war in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhat matters to us now is the immediate commitment to a complete ceasefire, the release of all hostages and prisoners, the introduction of urgent humanitarian aid through United Nations organizations, ensuring no displacement or annexation, and starting the reconstruction process,\u201d he said in a statement Saturday.",
      "There are 48 hostages still being held in Gaza, with 20 believed to be alive.",
      "Earlier on Friday, Trump said Hamas had until 6 p.m. Sunday to accept the ceasefire proposal.",
      "\u201cIf this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,\u201d Trump wrote in a lengthy post on Truth Social.",
      "Hamas on Friday also said it wanted to further discuss other elements of the peace plan.",
      "\u201cThe other issues mentioned in President Trump\u2019s proposal regarding the future of the Gaza Strip and the inherent rights of the Palestinian people are linked to a comprehensive national position and based on relevant international laws and resolutions,\u201d the group said. \u201cThey are to be discussed within a comprehensive Palestinian national framework. Hamas will be part of it and will contribute to it with full responsibility.\u201d",
      "Under the plan, Israel\u2019s assault in Gaza would end immediately once both sides agree to the proposal, with all hostages, alive and dead, to be released within 72 hours. The plan says no one will be forced to leave Gaza and those who do can return.",
      "A pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood is outlined as a possible outcome, but not a guarantee.",
      "By agreeing to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to an independent body of technocrats, Hamas appears to have agreed to one of the key points of Trump\u2019s plan to relinquish control, but it is still not clear whether it will agree to \u201cnot have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form,\u201d as the plan stipulates.",
      "The Hamas response does not address one critical point: disarmament. Trump\u2019s plan states that Hamas must agree to \u201ca process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning.\u201d This is likely to be one of the major sticking points if negotiations proceed.",
      "Hamas\u2019s response comes as the Israeli military is pressing ahead with a ground operation in famine-stricken Gaza City, despite mounting international pressure and isolation over its assault on the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcomed the Hamas response, according to his spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric.",
      "Guterres \u201curges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end,\u201d Dujarric said in a statement.",
      "Qatar and Egypt, both countries involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, also welcomed the Hamas response.",
      "In his video address on Truth Social on Friday, Trump thanked Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan as countries \u201cthat helped me put this together.\u201d",
      "If the deal is consummated, it would represent the clearest foreign policy victory of Trump\u2019s second term so far \u2014 the brokering of a peace agreement that proved elusive for his predecessor, President Joe Biden, and one that he promised he would deliver quickly as he campaigned for the Oval Office in 2024.",
      "During that race, Trump highlighted a deep rift in the Democratic Party over the war that pitted pro-Israel moderates against liberal defenders of Palestinians. Though Trump\u2019s focus on helping negotiate a permanent ceasefire has waxed and waned over the course of his eight-plus months in office, the conflict was never off his radar.",
      "He assigned one of his closest allies, fellow real estate mogul Steve Witkoff, to quarterback the American deal-making team, and he put his own capital on the line in discussions with major players in the region as recently as this week.",
      "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a longtime informal adviser to Trump, said in an interview with NBC News on Friday that the president has held a vision for the Middle East that includes progress for Israel and Arab nations since he first took office in 2017 and that his insistence on wrangling an apology from Netanyahu for Israeli strikes in Qatar demonstrated his commitment to that view.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is, first of all, a very subtle, complex set of relationships being nurtured by the president with a continued emphasis on a better future,\u201d Gingrich said.",
      "If a peace agreement \u201cactually happens,\u201d Gingrich added, it could put Trump in league with President Theodore Roosevelt, who negotiated an end to the Russo-Japanese war in the early part of the 20th century, and that \u201cwould have a substantial impact\u201d on the perception of Trump in the U.S.",
      "A senior Arab diplomat told NBC News that the Hamas response is \u201cpositive,\u201d adding: \u201cThey had no choice but to accept.\u201d",
      "But a former Western diplomat with experience in the region told NBC News that the plan could still fall apart.",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do. Hamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cTrump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019s bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan was met with cautious optimism earlier in the week by leaders elsewhere in the Middle East and around the world.",
      "Muslim powers including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey welcomed the plan in a joint statement calling Trump\u2019s efforts \u201csincere.\u201d",
      "The proposal also received support from Europe, with countries that had recently defied Washington by formally recognizing Palestinian statehood welcoming the initiative.",
      "But hours after Trump announced the plan, Netanyahu reiterated his past vows to oppose Palestinian statehood.",
      "\u201cInstead of Hamas isolating us, we turned the tables and isolated Hamas,\u201d he said in Hebrew in a video discussing his U.S. trip.",
      "The developments come on the eve of the second anniversary of the fighting, which began with the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.",
      "According to health officials in the enclave, Israeli forces have killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in the past two years."

      "The humble soybean is the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to reshape global trade.",
      "Used in everything from animal feed to fuel, soybeans regularly rank among the most valuable U.S. agricultural exports, towering over higher-profile crops like corn and cotton.",
      "More than $30 billion worth of American soybean products were exported in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "For American soybean farmers, their top overseas market has long been China, which bought around a third of the export crop \u2014 approximately $12 billion worth of American soybean products \u2014 in the last calendar year, USDA data shows.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war leaves U.S.-China relations somewhere between frosty and openly hostile, America\u2019s soybean farmers appear to be an early casualty.",
      "An embargo in all but name",
      "So far, China has not purchased any U.S. soybeans during this year\u2019s main harvest period, with sales falling to zero in May.",
      "This has pushed many American farmers reliant on soybeans nearly to the breaking point.",
      "It has also complicated the Trump administration\u2019s plans to provide billions in foreign economic aid to Argentina.",
      "Buenos Aires recently sold more than 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans to Beijing, after briefly suspending its export tax on the soy products.",
      "U.S. officials blame China for the looming crisis facing American soybean producers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC.",
      "Farmers view the situation differently, however. They want Trump to reach a trade deal with China that ends the unofficial embargo on soybeans. But instead, what they see is the White House preparing to bail out one of their chief rivals for the Chinese export market.",
      "\u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a recent statement.",
      "Meanwhile, China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyer of soybeans \u2014indicated last week that it won\u2019t resume U.S. purchases unless more Trump tariffs are lifted.",
      "\u201cAs for soybean trade, the U.S. side should take proactive steps to remove relevant unreasonable tariffs, create conditions for expanding bilateral trade, and inject more stability and certainty into global economic development,\u201d Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Beijing.",
      "Emergency relief is coming",
      "The Trump administration will announce new support for farmers, \u201cespecially the soybean farmers,\u201d on Tuesday, Bessent said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for the next planting season,\u201d he added.",
      "Bessent personally owns as much as $25 million worth of farmland in North Dakota that produces corn and soybeans, according to his recent financial disclosures.",
      "He said soybeans would be a topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month.",
      "Trump is also aware of the impact his trade policies are having on American farmers, starting with soybean growers.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d the president posted Wednesday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The question is whether this aid will come soon enough to save this year\u2019s massive harvest of soybeans.",
      "At the center of the firestorm is Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who warned this week that \u201cthis moment of uncertainty in the farm economy is real.\u201d Speaking on Fox Business Network, she emphasized that Trump has long supported U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President\u2019s November victory,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHe has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made.\u201d",
      "The Argentina factor",
      "The current U.S.-China stalemate over soybean exports is also complicating another American foreign policy conundrum: what to do about Argentina\u2019s faltering economy.",
      "As U.S. soybean exports to China screech to a halt, Argentina\u2019s farmers jumped at the opportunity to sell China their own soybeans.",
      "From their perspective, a potential U.S. economic aid package has nothing to do with their soybean exports, and everything to do with the personal and political alliance between Trump and libertarian President Javier Milei.",
      "Milei was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his 2024 election victory, and he has become a familiar face at U.S. political events attended by the president\u2019s MAGA supporters.",
      "At a Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. in February, Milei gifted then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk a red chainsaw.",
      "Musk then waved it around onstage, calling it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "Eight months later, Milei\u2019s popularity with voters has plunged, raising doubts about the future of his market-friendly economic reforms and strict austerity measures.",
      "Local elections in early September dealt a blow to Milei\u2019s party, triggering massive turmoil in Argentina\u2019s stock and currency markets.",
      "A few weeks after the market plunge, Bessent announced on social media that the U.S. was prepared to deploy billions of dollars to support the South American country.",
      "A presidential delegation from Buenos Aires is expected to visit the White House next week to finalize the U.S. foreign aid deal.",
      "This has infuriated the soybean farmers.",
      "\u201cU.S. soybean prices are falling, harvest is underway, and farmers read headlines not about securing a trade agreement with China, but that the U.S. government is extending $20 billion in economic support to Argentina while that country drops its soybean export taxes to sell 20 shiploads of Argentine soybeans to China in just two days,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "Meanwhile, Milei has also secured a currency swap line for Argentina from China, a situation that gives pause to some in Washington.",
      "In response, Milei has said Argentina will maintain its mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship with China.",
      "Tensions inside the Trump administration over China, Argentina and the soybean farmers broke into the open last week.",
      "While attending the U.N. General Assembly, Bessent received a text message from a contact labeled \u201cBR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bailed out Argentina yesterday \u2026 and in return, the Argentine\u2019s removed their export tariff on grains, reducing their price, and sold a bunch of soybeans to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,\u201d read the message, widely presumed to come from Rollins.",
      "\u201cSoy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,\u201d the message concluded.",
      "Spokespeople for Bessent and Rollins did not respond to questions about the text message exchange."

    "published": "Sat, 04 Oct 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Alibaba announced a new initiative aiming to reach AI superintelligence, heating up an arms race with American AI companies.",
    "story": [
      "Early last week in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, a slick, larger-than-life video screen beamed out four words that would drive tech giant Alibaba\u2019s stock to historic levels and signal a shift in China\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence: \u201cRoadmap to Artificial Superintelligence.\u201d",
      "During his 23-minute keynote address at the flagship Alibaba Cloud conference, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu charted out a future featuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI). These terms point to a theorized era in which AI becomes roughly as smart as humans (AGI) and then much, much smarter (ASI).",
      "While these terms have been tossed around Silicon Valley for years, Wu\u2019s presentation was notable: Alibaba is now the first established Chinese tech giant to explicitly invoke AGI and ASI.",
      "\u201cAchieving AGI \u2014 an intelligent system with general human-level cognition \u2014 now appears inevitable. Yet AGI is not the end of AI\u2019s development, but its beginning,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt will march toward ASI \u2014 intelligence beyond the human, capable of self-iteration and continuous evolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cASI will drive exponential technological leaps, carrying us into an unprecedented age of intelligence,\u201d Wu said, highlighting ASI\u2019s ability to help cure diseases, discover cleaner sources of energy and even unlock interstellar travel.",
      "The U.S. and China are the world\u2019s leading AI powers, each with immense computing capabilities and top-tier researchers developing cutting-edge systems. Yet observers have framed the countries as having different approaches to AI, with perceptions that China focuses more on real-world AI applications.",
      "For example, commentators recently argued that Beijing is currently \u201cwinning the race for AI robots\u201d against the U.S., as China is home to much of the world\u2019s most advanced robotics supply chains and a growing network of robotics, or embodied AI, labs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been some commentary in Western media recently about how the U.S. is missing the point by pushing for AGI, while China is focusing solely on applications,\u201d said Helen Toner, interim executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome Chinese researchers and some parts of the Chinese government have been interested in AGI and superintelligence for a long time,\u201d Toner said, though she noted this view was primarily held by smaller startups like DeepSeek.",
      "Afra Wang, a researcher focusing on China\u2019s tech scene, said Alibaba\u2019s invocation of AGI and ASI was remarkable.",
      "\u201cThis ASI narrative is definitely something new, especially among the biggest tech companies in China,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s \u201croadmap to artificial superintelligence\u201d seems to scramble mainstream perceptions. Any number of California techno-optimists, like Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei or xAI\u2019s Elon Musk, might have delivered Wu\u2019s speech, selling a technology-enabled utopia while largely sidestepping darker questions about how humanity would co-exist with or survive an era of digital superintelligence.",
      "The concept of superintelligence has long been on the minds of \u2014 if not explicitly guiding \u2014 prominent American AI companies. For example, OpenAI released an article focused on the safe development of superintelligent AI models in May 2023. \u201cNow is a good time to start thinking about the governance of superintelligence \u2014 future AI systems dramatically more capable than even AGI,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The possibility of superintelligence is now even being acknowledged in Congress. On Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., announced a draft bill that would, among other actions, \u201cassist Congress in determining the potential for controlled AI systems to reach artificial superintelligence.\u201d",
      "To some, ASI might seem like an outlandish concept when today\u2019s AI systems fail to understand basic tennis rules, hallucinate or fabricate basic information, or do not seem to actually comprehend how the external world functions.",
      "At the same time, AI systems continue to approach and sometimes surpass human capabilities in many domains, from driving cars safely to winning international coding competitions, leaving many experts to say it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, humans develop digital superintelligence.",
      "As the idea of superintelligence gradually enters mainstream debates, many American politicians have announced that the U.S. is in an AI race with China. The White House\u2019s current AI manifesto is titled \u201cWinning the AI Race: America\u2019s AI Action Plan,\u201d while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, proclaimed that \u201cas a matter of economic security, as a matter of national security, America has to beat China in the AI race.\u201d",
      "Yet charges of an AI race are muddied by a lack of an agreed end goal and swirling definitions of AGI. At worst, experts think an unfettered race toward AGI or ASI could lead to widespread catastrophe or even the end of humanity.",
      "But there\u2019s also plenty of skepticism around talk of AGI and ASI and whether it\u2019s primarily for marketing purposes.",
      "Alibaba is one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, known for providing powerful, free AI models \u2014 also called open-source models \u2014 for download. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model series, a competitor to models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 or Anthropic\u2019s Claude, is the most popular open-source AI system in the world.",
      "Wu announced a new series of Qwen models in his speech last week, including a model that combines text, images, video and audio capabilities.",
      "Many observers point out that narratives about a U.S.-China AI race and a resulting sprint to build AI infrastructure serve AI investors by propping up company valuations and increasing their soft power. Alibaba\u2019s stock has soared since Wu\u2019s speech last week, part of a larger $250 billion comeback this year that has made it China\u2019s hottest AI company.",
      "To unlock a powerful, superintelligent future, Wu predicted that large AI models will replace existing operating systems as the link between users, software and computational power. This future network of large AI models will run on cloud computing networks like Alibaba Cloud, he said.",
      "Irene Zhang, a researcher on China\u2019s AI ecosystem and an editor of ChinaTalk, noted the business undertones of Wu\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cThis is a vision of AGI and ASI that\u2019s directly based on Alibaba\u2019s business model,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAlibaba Cloud dominates China\u2019s cloud computing market, and its global market share is now bigger than Oracle\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cAlibaba\u2019s commercial strategy and its publicly stated views on ASI/AGI are symbiotic.\u201d",
      "Matt Sheehan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, agreed.",
      "\u201cASI is the ultimate frontier, as far as the discourse goes on AI,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that Alibaba set this grandiose goal, but in reality, they\u2019re selling cloud services.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Oct. 5, 2025, 4:55 p.m ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the state represented by Sen. Richard Blumenthal. He represents Connecticut, not Illinois."

      "TOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s governing party elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader on Saturday, setting her up to become the U.S. ally\u2019s first female prime minister.",
      "Takaichi defeated Shinjiro Koizumi 185 to 156 in a second-round runoff vote to become leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II.",
      "The leadership race was triggered last month when Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he would step down after a year in office. Though Takaichi is likely to succeed him as prime minister of Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes later this month, it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "\u201cRight now, rather than feeling happy, I truly believe this is where the real challenge begins,\u201d Takaichi said in her victory speech. \u201cThere is a mountain of work we must all tackle together.\u201d",
      "She also said it was important to make the LDP, which has been tarnished by corruption scandals, \u201ca more spirited and vibrant party, a party that transforms people\u2019s anxieties into hope.\u201d",
      "Takaichi, 64, a hard-line conservative who says her hero is former British leader Margaret Thatcher, was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader.",
      "Though many party members welcome Takaichi\u2019s ascendance as a potential return to the days of Abe, there are concerns that her nationalistic historical views could cause friction with East Asian neighbors China and South Korea.",
      "\u201cBeijing is likely to object to Takaichi\u2019s positions on revising Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution, strengthening maritime security, and bolstering support for Taiwan,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "One of the top priorities for Japan\u2019s next prime minister will be implementing the trade deal reached with the Trump administration in July. The agreement, which imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods including its crucial auto exports, has yet to be put in writing and many of the details remain unclear.",
      "Takaichi has raised the possibility of reopening talks on the deal, which includes a pledge by Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S.",
      "She told reporters after her victory on Saturday that she did not intend to \u201coverturn\u201d anything that Japan and the United States had agreed upon.",
      "\u201cI will firmly adhere to the agreement reached between our two countries,\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cThis applies to tariffs and also investments as well.\u201d",
      "The LDP voted on five leadership candidates in the first round, with Takaichi securing 183 votes to Koizumi\u2019s 164. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, the top spokesperson for the current Japanese government, came in third with 134 votes after a recent surge in polls.",
      "Votes in the first round were divided evenly between 294 LDP lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members who were represented by 295 votes. Lawmakers favored the more moderate Koizumi, while party members preferred Takaichi, who has a passionate base.",
      "In the second round, lawmakers had the same number of votes while rank-and-file party members had 47, representing the 47 prefectures of Japan.",
      "Lawmakers in the second round voted 149 to 145 in favor of Takaichi, while party members gave her 36 votes compared with Koizumi\u2019s 11.",
      "Koizumi, 44, the current agriculture minister and the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, would have been Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",

    "summary": "The terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, has stoked fears among Britain's Jewish community amid a rise in antisemitism.",
    "story": [
      "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was shocked by Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar.",
      "But for many British Jews, this was anything but a shock, rather the culmination of a wave of antisemitism in Britain that was rising before Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel\u2019s subsequent military assault on Gaza \u2014  and has only intensified since.",
      "There has been a rise in anti-Jewish hostility in Britain that predates the attack in Israel and the Gaza war that started three years ago, according to community groups and the people suffering the first-hand effects in the United Kingdom. But the incident at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall has brought the issue of antisemitism to the fore again \u2014 leaving many Jewish people in Britain worried for the safety of their friends and family.",
      "\u201cI just keep thinking about my children,\u201d said Josh Simons, a member of Parliament who represents the Makerfield constituency near Manchester, and whose family fled persecution in Europe for the relative safety of England around a century ago. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and I think everybody in this community will be holding their children tonight that little bit closer.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News on Thursday that the community was feeling \u201cfrightened, scared and hurt.\u201d",
      "Two men, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed during the attack on the synagogue.",
      "Greater Manchester Police said Friday that one of them suffered a wound as armed officers attempted to shoot the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove into a group of people before stabbing a man. Al-Shamie did not have a firearm. But for many in the Jewish community the attack, which also left three people injured, was the culmination of something that had been festering for some time.",
      "\u201cThis is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come,\u201d Britain\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, also said in a statement. \u201cFor so long we have witnessed an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, on campuses, on social media and elsewhere \u2014 this is the tragic result,\u201d he added.",
      "Since Israel launched its military offensive in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on the country, there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents in Britain, according to the Community Security Trust, a charity that coordinates security measures at Jewish institutions and tracks this data. The group defines antisemitism as \u201chatred, bigotry, prejudice or discrimination against Jews,\u201d on its website.",
      "That year, 2023, saw 4,103 antisemitic incidents reported to the CST \u2014 the most on record \u2014 and last year\u2019s 3,528 was the second highest. Swastikas and other graffiti have been daubed on synagogues and other sites, and security has been heightened at Jewish schools.",
      "In the space of a week last month, urine and feces were smeared over seven synagogues and a children\u2019s nursery in Golders Green, a part of north London known for its large Jewish population. \u201cThese repeated attacks have left our community anxious, hurt and increasingly worried,\u201d a spokesperson for the local Shomrim community Jewish patrol group said at the time.",
      "In May, a Jewish-owned business in nearby Stamford Hill, which has a large Orthodox Jewish community, was daubed in red paint and had its windows smashed. Graffiti alleged the firm had links to an Israeli arms manufacturer, but traumatized staff there said this wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the number of attacks has increased since the Gaza conflict,\u201d Graham Stringer, another member of Parliament serving Blackley and Middleton, another constituency close to Manchester, said  in an interview Friday. \u201cThe Jewish community has been angry and frightened and so, incidentally, has the Muslim community.\u201d",
      "There was an increase in religious hate crimes targeted against Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, with 3,866 offenses in the year leading up to March 2024, according to the latest government data. This was up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year, the data showed.",
      "Perhaps this is why the 2025 Jewish Landscape Report, an annual global survey, found that 81% of respondents in Britain felt the need to conceal their Jewishness in public.",
      "In a febrile atmosphere, Starmer is now under pressure to reassure British Jews \u2014 who make up just 290,000 of Britain\u2019s 70-million population, according to the last census in 2021 \u2014 that they are safe.",
      "He said Thursday he would do \u201ceverything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community.\u201d",
      "The necessity of that was evident hours after the incident in Manchester, when two cars drove past the scene displaying Palestinian flags, while some men in balaclavas could be heard muttering about \u201cJews\u201d, according to a Reuters journalist at the scene.",
      "Other observers were dismayed to see pro-Palestinian marches going ahead Thursday evening in Manchester, London and other cities.",
      "There have been regular marches and protests in cities across the country about Israel\u2019s conduct during the war, which will enter its third year Tuesday. Among the crowds, which have on occasion contained tens of thousands, there have been displays of violent antisemitic sentiment, as well as language that conflates enmity toward Israel, Zionism and Jews themselves.",
      "On Friday, protesters said they were supporting an urgent cause, specifically the aid flotilla that was intercepted by the Israeli military en route to Gaza.",
      "But for others \u2014 both in and outside the Jewish community \u2014 it was disappointing not to have a pause in the demonstrations that have often been interpreted as hostile by British Jews.",
      "\u201cI do think that carrying on in this way does feel un-British, it feels wrong,\u201d Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC. \u201cIt is important to draw a line between what is happening in the Middle East and what is happening at home.\u201d"

      "As the spiritual leader of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury heads a global Anglican community of around 85 million people across 165 countries.",
      "In a statement following her appointment, Mullally said: \u201cAs I respond to the call of Christ to this new ministry, I do so in the same spirit of service to God and to others that has motivated me since I first came to faith as a teenager.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt every stage of that journey, through my nursing career and Christian ministry, I have learned to listen deeply \u2014 to people and to God\u2019s gentle prompting \u2014 to seek to bring people together to find hope and healing.\u201d",
      "Mullally became the first female bishop of London in 2018, having first been ordained in 2001. Before joining the church, she had been a specialist cancer nurse, rising to become the government\u2019s youngest chief nursing officer for England at the age of 37.",
      "Mullally\u2019s appointment comes 11 months after the previous archbishop, Justin Welby, resigned after a damning report into his handling of the case of a prolific child abuser associated with the church.",
      "She will become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury since St.  Augustine was sent by Pope Gregory to convert the English people to Roman Christianity in 597.",
      "Starmer welcomed Mullally\u2019s appointment, saying she would play \u201ca key role in our national life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Church of England is of profound importance to this country. Its churches, cathedrals, schools, and charities are part of the fabric of our communities,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "In an address following her appointment, Mullally said that \u201cin the apparent chaos which surrounds us, in the midst of such profound global uncertainty, the possibility of healing lies in acts of kindness and love.\u201d",
      "She added that Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester showed that Church of England members \u201chave a responsibility to be a people who stand with the Jewish community against antisemitism in all its forms. Hatred and racism of any kind cannot be allowed to tear us apart.\u201d"

      "William was speaking with Canadian actor and comedian Eugene Levy in Windsor for Levy\u2019s Apple TV+ travel series, \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "Asked if the monarchy would be shifting in a different direction when he becomes king, the Prince of Wales said: \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that change is on my agenda. Change for good, and I embrace that and I enjoy that change. I don\u2019t fear it, that\u2019s the bit that excites me is the idea of being able to bring some change.\u201d",
      "William, heir to the throne currently held by King Charles, did not offer any specific changes he would be interested in making and said he did not want \u201coverly radical change,\u201d but said that \u201cif you\u2019re not careful, history can be a real weight and an anchor around you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that tradition stays, and tradition has a huge part in all of this,\u201d he said in a clip from the upcoming episode. \u201cBut there\u2019s also points where you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\u201d",
      "While giving Levy a private tour of Windsor Castle, where King Charles recently hosted a state banquet for President Donald Trump, William said he no longer found his royal duties overwhelming, but admitted that \u201cstuff to do with family overwhelms me quite a bit.\u201d",

We try to make sure we give them the security and the safety that they need. And we\u2019re a very open family, so we talk about things that bother us, and things that trouble us, but you never quite know the knock-on effects that it can have.\u201d",
      "William, who has historically been more averse to the media spotlight than his younger brother, Harry, also discussed how his experience of \u201cinsatiable\u201d media intrusion around his mother, the late Princess Diana, during his childhood has shaped the way he handles the press.",
      "\u201cThey wanted every bit of detail they could absorb, and they were in everything, literally everywhere.

      "The governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is voting for a new party leader after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced last month that he was stepping down.",
      "The winner is likely to become the new prime minister of Japan, a key U.S. ally and the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes in mid-October \u2014 though it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "Conservative nationalist Sanae Takaichi, 64, and the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi, 44, are the front-runners among the five candidates. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, who is currently the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, has also surged in public opinion polls and could end up on top.",
      "The new LDP leader will be selected by 295 lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members, who will be represented by another 295 votes. The top two candidates are likely to then enter a runoff.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, but right now, polls suggest that Koizumi is in the pole position,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "The LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II, is doing some \u201csoul-searching,\u201d Kingston said, after election losses spurred by a party corruption scandal as well as public dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living.",
      "Those who think the party hasn\u2019t done enough to root out corruption and needs a \u201creset\u201d are looking for a \u201cfresh face\u201d and to \u201chand the baton to a younger, more charismatic leader\u201d such as Koizumi, Kingston said.",
      "Koizumi, the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is a former environment minister but gained more prominence recently as agriculture minister when he was able to rein in runaway prices of rice, a staple Japanese food.",
      "He would be Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",
      "Others prefer Takaichi because she was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader, whose wing of the LDP has been tarnished by corruption scandals.",
      "\u201cTheir view is that the LDP has to return to its DNA to be the right-wing conservative party, and that Takaichi is the one best positioned to sort of return to the glory of Abe,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi, who has a passionate hard-line conservative base among rank-and-file party members, says one of her role models is former British leader Margaret Thatcher.",
      "\u201cShe does project strength in the way that Margaret Thatcher projected strength, and she wants to be that kind of Iron Lady of Japan,\u201d said Jeffrey Hall, a special lecturer in Japanese studies at Kanda University of International Studies.",
      "But some LDP lawmakers consider Takaichi too far right, expressing concern that her nationalistic historical views could undermine relations with China, Japan\u2019s biggest trading partner.",
      "Moderate forces could unite behind another candidate to block Takaichi from winning, much as they did in last year\u2019s leadership race when she lost to Ishiba.",
      "One person who stands to benefit from that scenario is Hayashi, who like Koizumi is Ivy League-educated. Having served in almost every major cabinet post, including foreign minister, Hayashi \u201creally stands for experience and stability,\u201d Hall said.",
      "All of the candidates have talked tough on immigration, an increasingly sensitive issue in Japan, where tourists are coming in record numbers and foreign-born residents make up a growing proportion of the population as the government grapples with labor shortages.",
      "But Takaichi has taken the strongest stances, decrying the rudeness of foreign tourists and accusing them of abusing the famous deer in Nara.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s definitely appealing to the online conservatives who have very strong anti-foreign feelings,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Koizumi, Takaichi and Hayashi all have roughly the same policy toward the U.S., \u201cwhich is keeping the status quo,\u201d he said.",
      "At the moment, the U.S. relationship \u201cis a huge headache for Japan,\u201d and there are signs that the trade deal reached with President Donald Trump in July is \u201cunraveling,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "The impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs has been especially felt by Japan\u2019s crucial auto industry, including brands popular in the U.S. such as Nissan, Honda and Toyota.",
      "Last month the U.S. tariff on cars imported from Japan was lowered to 15% from 27.5%, the same rate the U.S. imposes on almost all Japanese goods under the deal, which has yet to be put in writing. But that is still considerably higher than the previous 2.5%.",
      "The tariffs were lowered in part because Japan pledged $550 billion in U.S. investment, though there are disagreements between Washington and Tokyo as to what form that investment will take and how each country will benefit.",
