      "Kara Young\u2019s work in the play \u201cPurpose\u201d has earned her a Tony Award nomination and a chance to make history",
      "NEW YORK -- Don't bother asking Kara Young which one of her roles is her favorite. They're all her favorite.",
      "\u201cEvery single time I\u2019m doing a show, I feel like it is the most important thing on the planet,\u201d she says. \u201cI don't have a favorite. It\u2019s like this: Every, every single project has held its own weight.\u201d",
      "Right now, the weighty project on her mind is Broadway's celebrated \u201cPurpose,\u201d Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019 drawing-room drama at the Helen Hayes Theater about an accomplished Black family revealing its hypocrisy and fault lines during a snowed-in gathering.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much in this play,\u201d says Young, who plays an outsider who witnesses the implosion. \u201cLike a lot of the great writers, he creates these universes in a line or the space between the words.\u201d",
      "\u201cPurpose\u201d is set in the Jasper family\u2019s living room in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Chicago. The patriarch is Pastor Solomon Jasper, a Civil Rights legend, and his steely wife, Claudine.",
      "They are reuniting with their two sons \u2014 Junior, a disgraced former state senator, recently released after serving a prison sentence for embezzling funds, and Naz, who fled divinity school and is now a nature photographer.",
      "Young plays Aziza, a Harlem-bred social worker who has been close friends with Naz but didn't know anything about his family. \u201cThis kind of thing never happens to me! I never meet famous people and you\u2019ve been famous this whole time?\u201d she screams.",
      "Her awe quickly fades as sibling jealousies, parental frustrations, past sins and the pressures of legacy come tumbling out over a fraught dinner. There is some slapping.",
      "\u201cWe are so susceptible to get angry with the people we love the most,\u201d says Young. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the less than 12 hours of them being together for the first time in two years, they\u2019re sitting down and having dinner, and all of these things come up, as they often do.\u201d",
      "Young's work has earned her a Tony Award nomination and a chance to make history. Already the first Black person to be nominated four times consecutively, if she wins, she\u2019ll be the first Black performer to win two Tonys in a row.",
      "Young made her Broadway debut in 2021 in \u201cClyde\u2019s,\u201d was in \u201cCost of Living\u201d the next year and co-starred opposite Leslie Odom Jr. in 2024's \u201cPurlie Victorious: A Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch,\u201d winning a Tony.",
      "Jacobs-Jenkins calls Aziz in his script a \u201cdeeply perceptive person and empathetic\u201d and that could also apply to Young, She says she closely identifies with her character in \u201cPurpose,\u201d \u2014 they're both Harlem-bred advocates for others, hoping to make the planet better.",
      "\u201cI feel connected to that core of her,\u201d says Young. \u201cEvery single play I've done since my 10-minute play festivals, I\u2019m always like, \u2018Wow, this feels like this can change the world,\u2019 you know? And I feel like at the core of Aziza, that\u2019s how she feels. She wants to change the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cPurpose,\u201d directed by Phylicia Rashad, also stars LaTanya Richardson Jackson, Harry Lennix, Jon Michael Hill, Alana Arenas and Glenn Davis.",
      "Hill, who as Naz also earned a Tony nomination for best lead male actor in a play, calls Young \u201cthe heart and joy of our little family over there at the Helen Hayes.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe enters the building and she just makes time for everyone and is genuinely excited to see people and hear about how they\u2019re doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve really never seen anyone have as much room in their consciousness and their being for everyone she encounters. She approaches every day with joy and curiosity and enthusiasm.\u201d",
      "If there's one story that shows who Young is, it would be from the day of the Met Gala, which she and cast members of \u201cPurpose\u201d were invited, along with its playwright. That same day, Jacobs-Jenkins won the Pulitzer Prize for drama.",
      "Young found out while getting her makeup done and began screaming. When she got to the gala \u2014 a look-at-me moment, if there ever was one \u2014 she was a walking advertisement for the play. \u201cI told everybody, \u2018You have to come and see this play. He just won a Pulitzer!\u2019\u201d",
      "Hill was right behind her and smiling as Young made connections and introductions. \u201cShe was just going up to everyone and introducing us and talking about our show and trying to get folks in the door.\u201d",
      "Young made her 2016 stage debut in Patricia Ione Lloyd\u2019s play \u201cPretty Hunger\u201d at the Public Theater, a play about a 7-year-old Black girl who didn't know she was Black. The playwright told her she wrote it with Young in mind.",
      "\u201cIone Lloyd is one of the people who really made me see myself as an artist,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that kind of set a path for me in a really beautiful way.\u201d",
      "Next up for Young is the movie \u201cIs God Is,\u201d which playwright Aleshea Harris is directing from her own 2018 stage play. Sterling K. Brown, Vivica A. Fox and Janelle Mon\u00e1e are in the cast. Young calls it \u201ca spaghetti Western-meets-Tarantino-meets-the Greeks.\u201d Next summer on Broadway, she'll star in a revival of \u201cThe Whoopi Monologues\u201d opposite Kerry Washington.",
      "After that, who knows? \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next, but I can\u2019t wait, whatever that is,\u201d she says. \u201cIf something comes along, it\u2019s about jumping into the next thing. If there\u2019s life in me, I got to live it.\u201d",

      "YouTube\u2019s biggest creator is offering an exclusive weekend on the set of Beast Games Season 2 to the first 40 donors who make $100,000 gifts to his registered nonprofit. The earliest contributors and up to two guests each will spend June 27-29 touring MrBeast\u2019s North Carolina studio, hearing from the production team in a private Q&A and visiting Beast Philanthropy\u2019s food pantry.",
      "The invitation comes as Jimmy Donaldson\u2019s reported $5 billion media empire surpasses 400 million subscribers on YouTube, where he had already set the record for the biggest following. But the call raises a question: Who among his following of young people and their parents can make a six-figure donation?",
      "\u201cI have some big charity projects I want to fund so I think it\u2019s a win/win,\u201d MrBeast said in a post on X.",
      "Rallying his fervent fan base to make their own contributions marks a new fundraising strategy for Donaldson. He has long stated that his YouTube pages\u2019 featured charitable work is funded with his Beast Philanthropy channel\u2019s revenue.",
      "The content has drawn a mix of praise from fans for working with local nonprofits to support previously unfunded projects and pushback from critics who accused Donaldson of exploiting vulnerable people for clickbait \u201cinspiration porn.\u201d Campaigns have involved treating rheumatic heart disease in Nigeria and protecting endangered animals in Kenya. Other examples include building wells in countries across Africa and covering the cost of cataract surgery for 1,000 people.",
      "The call also signals Donaldson\u2019s continued philanthropic presence after comments suggesting he would get \u201cless hate\u201d if he stepped away from philanthropy altogether. Responding to allegations that he uses philanthropy as a shield, Donaldson said he thinks \u201cit paints a negative spotlight on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople hate me more because I do good,\u201d Donaldson said in a conversation uploaded last November on the YouTube channel oompaville. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s too crazy of a statement. I\u2019m not trying to sound like a victim here or anything.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe truth is, I just find videos where I help people more fun than videos where I don\u2019t,\u201d he added.",
      "Monday\u2019s announcement comes shortly after Amazon Prime Video renewed Beast Games for two more seasons. The reality competition series pitted 1,000 contestants against each other for a $5 million grand prize that doubled in the Feb. 13 finale. Forbes reported that the show broke the streaming service\u2019s record by totaling 50 million views in the 25 days after its premiere.",

      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\u201cWhy is there a spiral there?\u201d said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum\u2019s educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\u201d said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",

      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",

The show, narrated by actor Pedro Pascal, features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker \u2014 including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",

      "When he was first asked to lead the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number",
      "NEW YORK -- When he was first asked to helm the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number. It was just too delicious.",
      "\u201cWhen they sent it to me, I was cooking and I burnt dinner because my mind was spinning,\" he says. \"I was, like, \u2018This is a gift. I will never get an opening number like this again.\u2019\u201d",
      "So Gattelli worked out everything else about how to put Robert Zemeckis\u2019 1992 comic cult classic onto a stage and only then turned to the big, brassy song, \u201cFor the Gaze,\u201d a winking valentine to gay men, punning along the way.",
      "\u201cI was able to do the show and then have my full brain on that number because I knew the potential of what it could be,\u201d he says.",
      "What Gattelli crafted is an opening number for the ages, led by Megan Hilty: There are mid-song costume changes, dance breaks, chorus boys hoisting Hilty, spangly jumpsuits and tuxedos, high-kicking Vegas showgirls with feather headdresses, a body double doing somersaults, a rainbow flag of top-hatted dancers, and Hilty doing a Liza Minnelli cameo, all ending with the grand finale of Hilty as Judy Garland's Dorothy from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d complete with a little stuffed dog.",
      "\u201cI heard the pocket in that song, and I was like, \u2018I know there\u2019s a giant laugh there. I can hear giant laughs, what\u2019s that giant laugh?'\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest gay reference? Then I literally I just worked backwards.\u201d",
      "That number telegraphs to the audience exactly what to expect for the rest of the night \u2014 a perfectly rehearsed, lushly costumed, silly, self-aware comedy.",
      "\u201cOnce we hit \u2018For the Gaze,\u2019 the audience knows exactly what the show is,\" he says. \"And then I think they\u2019re in for the ride.\u201d",
      "The work on \u201cFor the Gaze\u201d has helped Gattelli see his show earn 10 Tony Award nominations, including one for his Broadway debut as a director and another for his choreography.",
      "The musical is based on the film, which starred Meryl Streep as a self-centered actor and Goldie Hawn as her suffering-in-the-shadows writer friend. Their mutual desperate measures for achieving eternal youth turn comically grotesque. Hilty plays the Streep role, while Jennifer Simard plays the Hawn one.",
      "\u201cIt felt like just the perfect fit for what I do and what I love to do,\" Gattelli says. \"I love comedy and I love to direct comedy and I love to do these big splashy numbers. It felt like everything I\u2019ve been itching to do.\u201d",
      "Gattelli \u2014 who was a dancer in the original \u201cCats\u201d \u2014 has been a mainstay on Broadway of late, able to choreograph such venerable works as \u201cThe King and I\u201d and \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d but also irreverent musicals as \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d and the jukebox variety, like \u201cThe Cher Show.\u201d",
      "He made his directing debut off-Broadway in 2011 with \u201cSilence!\u201d a parody musical of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d complete with a chorus of dancing lambs running across the stage.",
      "Lowe Cunningham, lead producer of \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d saw it in Los Angeles and later asked Gattelli about the experience, how he collaborated and his approach to the work. She was impressed by his openness to all ideas and his caring.",
      "\u201cI think first and foremost, his talent is clear and it\u2019s been out there in the world of choreography for a long time. He is innovative, he does things other people aren\u2019t doing, but the other thing is that he\u2019s renowned as being an incredibly kind human being,\u201d she says.",
      "Gattelli, who won a 2012 Tony for choreographing \u201cNewsies the Musical\u201d \u2014 one of his show-stopping moments was dancers sliding on newspapers \u2014 was brought in relatively late to \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d only a year and half before opening on Broadway.",
      "\u201cIt was a great lesson in trusting your instincts,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said, \u2018We want a lush, opulent, sexy, magical sparkling evening.\u2019 And we just started taking big swings.\u201d",

      "The musical is filled with very funny special effects that are decidedly low-tech. At one point, the two leading ladies are replaced by two men duking it out in dresses and wigs. The audience roars at the deception and Gattelli even advised one of the male combatants not to shave his arm hair.",
      "\u201cThe audience is in on the joke,\u201d he says. \u201cI love that they go on that ride with us. They\u2019re laughing with us. We\u2019re all laughing together and it feels good.\u201d",

      "The creative team \u2014 which also included set designer Derek McLane, lighting designer Justin Townsend and sound designer Peter Hylenski \u2014 decided to make it a dance punctuated by sound effects.",
      "Warren Yang \u2014 an actor with a gymnastics background \u2014 wears Hilty's outfit and a wig as he tumbles slowly, acrobatically and theatrically down the stairs, somersaulting as thunder sounds crash and we hear what seems like bones cracking. (The stairs were made of the rubber Neoprene for safety.)",
      "\u201cThere are very simple techniques that make a big impact,\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cI just went back to it\u2019s a beautiful, lush, gorgeous show, but, at the core, it\u2019s just theatrical magic and stagecraft.\u201d",

      "\u201cLilo & Stich\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u2014The Final Reckoning\u201d dominated the box office charts again after fueling a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend. Theaters in the U.S. and Canada had several new films to offer this weekend as well, including Sony\u2019s family friendly \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d and the A24 horror movie \u201cBring Her Back. \u201d According to studio estimates Sunday, it added up to a robust $149 million post-holiday weekend that\u2019s up over 120% from the same timeframe last year.",
      "Disney\u2019s live-action hybrid \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d took first place again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. It was enough to pass \u201cSinners\u201d to become the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Globally, its running total is $610.8 million. \u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, is still going strong in its seventh weekend with another $5.2 million, bumping it to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million globally.",
      "The eighth \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie also repeated in second place, with $27.3 million from 3,861 locations. As with \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d that's down 57% from its opening. With $122.6 million in domestic tickets sold, it\u2019s performing in line with the two previous installments. But with a reported production budget of $400 million, profitability is a ways off. Internationally, it added $76.1 million (including $25.2 million from China where it just opened), bringing its global total to $353.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis is the year of longterm playability,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst. \u201cThe currency of word of mouth and the strong hold is more important than opening weekend dollars.\u201d",
      "Leading the newcomers was Sony\u2019s \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d with an estimated $21 million from 3,809 locations. The movie brings Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio together to train a new kid, the kung fu prodigy Li Fong ( Ben Wang ). Chan starred in a 2010 reboot of the 1984 original, while Macchio has found a new generation of fans in the series \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d which just concluded a six-season run.",
      "Reviews might have been mixed, but opening weekend audiences gave the PG-13 rated film a strong A- CinemaScore and 4.5 stars on PostTrak. It also only cost a reported $45 million to produce and has several weeks until a new family-friendly film arrives. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d opened earlier internationally and has a worldwide total of $47 million.",
      "Fourth place went \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d which earned $10.8 million in its third weekend. The movie is the highest-grossing in the franchise, not accounting for inflation, with $229.3 million globally.",
      "The weekend\u2019s other big newcomer, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d rounded out the top five with $7.1 million from 2,449 screens. Starring Sally Hawkins as a foster mother with some disturbing plans, the film is the sophomore feature of twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou, who made the 2023 horror breakout \u201cTalk to Me.\u201d It earned a rare-for-horror B+ CinemaScore and is essentially the only new film in the genre until \u201c28 Years Later\u201d opens on June 20.",
      "A new Wes Anderson movie, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d also debuted in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, where it made $270,000. It expands nationwide next weekend.",
      "The summer box office forecast remains promising, though there\u2019s a long way to go to get to the $4 billion target (a pre-pandemic norm that only the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer has surpassed). The month of May is expected to close out with $973 million \u2013 up 75% from May 2024, according to data from Comscore.",

      "Hindoyan will conduct two productions in 2026-27 and three in each of the following four seasons, LA Opera President Christopher Koelsch said. Koelsch hopes Hindoyan can lead works with Yoncheva, who has not sung a staged production at the LA Opera.",
      "Like other companies, the LA Opera has struggled with increased costs following the pandemic and scrapped a planned pair of world premieres over finances. Tenor and conductor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo was a key figure in fundraising for the company as general director from 2003-19.",
      "\u201cPart of my job as a music director and the job of any musician is to really take care of the art form as much as we can,\" Hindoyan said, \"not only on stage, not only studying at home (but also) the connection with the community and the connection to the donors.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan was born in Caracas, played violin and is a product of El Sistema, the Venezuelan music education system that was instrumental in the careers of Gustavo Dudamel and Rafael Payare. He was an assistant to Daniel Barenboim at Berlin\u2019s Staatsoper unter den Linden.",
      "\u201cGiven Barenboim's extremely exacting standards, I was impressed that he had that job and held onto that job,\" Koelsch said. \u201cAnd then I saw a performance of 'Tosca' and was kind of immediately struck by the elegance of the baton technique and just the sort of the absolute clarity of what he was conveying.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan has been chief conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic since the 2021-22 season. He first conducted the LA Opera last November in Gounod\u2019s \u201cRom\u00e9o et Juliette.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of a natural warmth and charisma to him. In my experience, he almost always coaxes the best out of people,\" Koelsch said. \u201cThe 'Rom\u00e9o' run for me was kind of a test run of how those qualities resonated inside our building, how it worked with the orchestra and the chorus and the administration and the audiences.\u201d",

      "Al Clausen, the Emmy-winning composer who provided the music for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d for 27 years, has died at age 84",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Alf Clausen, the Emmy-winning composer whose music provided essential accompaniment for the animated antics of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d for 27 years, has died.",
      "His daughter Kaarin Clausen told The Associated Press that Alf Clausen died Thursday at his home in Los Angeles after struggling with Parkinson's Disease for about a decade. He was 84.",
      "Clausen, who also scored TV series including \u201cMoonlighting\u201d and \u201cAlf\u201d (\"no relation,\" he used to joke) was nominated for 30 Emmy Awards, 21 of them for \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d winning twice.",
      "Al Jean, an early \u201cSimpsons\u201d writer who was one of the key creative figures on the show in the 1990s, said in a post on X Friday that \u201cClausen was an incredibly talented man who did so much for The Simpsons.\"",
      "While Danny Elfman wrote the show's theme song, Clausen joined the Fox animated series created by Matt Groening in 1990 and provided essentially all of its music until 2017, composing nearly 600 scores and conducting the 35-piece orchestra that played it in the studio.",
      "His colleagues said his music was a key component of the show's comedy, but Clausen believed the best way to back up the gags of Homer, Marge Bart and Lisa was by making the music as straight as possible.",
      "\u201cThis is a dream job for a composer,\u201d Clausen told Variety, which first reported his death, in 1998. \u201cMatt Groening said to me very early on, \u2018We\u2019re not a cartoon. We\u2019re a drama where the characters are drawn. I want you to score it like a drama.\u2019 I score the emotions of the characters as opposed to specific action hits on the screen.\u201d",
      "Groening, in a 1996 interview, called him \u201cone of the unacknowledged treasures of the show.\u201d",
      "Clausen was born in Minneapolis and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota. He graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 1966, and moved to Los Angeles seeking a career in music.",
      "In the 1970s he was a musical director on several TV variety shows including \u201cDonny & Marie.\u201d",
      "Clausen worked as an orchestrator for composer Lee Holdridge in his scores for 1980s films including \u201cSplash\u201d and \u201cThe Beastmaster.\u201d",
      "It was Holdridge who first got the composing job on \u201cMoonlighting,\" the late-80s ABC rom-com detective series starring Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd, but he handed the gig off to Clausen, who would get six Emmy nominations for his music on it.",
      "Clausen won his Emmys for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in 1997 and 1998 and also won five Annie Awards, which honor work in animation in film and television.",
      "He was fired from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in a cost-cutting move in 2017, to the outrage of his collaborators and fans. He sued over his dismissal.",
      "Clausen is survived by his wife Sally, children Kaarin, Scott and Kyle, stepchildren Josh and Emily, and 11 grandchildren.",

      "WASHINGTON -- One day before the kickoff concert for World Pride 2025 in the nation's capital, headlining performer Shakira has abruptly cancelled due to equipment difficulties.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that unforeseen circumstances have forced the cancellation\u201d of the concert, the Capital Pride Alliance, the main World Pride organizer, said in a Friday statement. \u201cUpdates about the relocated Opening Ceremony program will be released as soon as they are finalized!\u201d",
      "The multi-platinum singer had been scheduled to headline the opening celebrations Saturday night at Nationals Park. The reasons are apparently an extension of equipment issues related to her Thursday night concert in Boston's Fenway Park, which was also cancelled hours before it was set to begin. A Friday night concert at Fenway for country star Jason Aldean was also cancelled.",
      "\u201cDue to complications with the previous show in Boston, Shakira\u2019s full tour production cannot be transported to Washington, D.C. in time for her scheduled performance at Nationals Park,\u201d the Capital Pride Alliance statement said. \u201cDespite every effort to make it happen, it is not possible to move forward as planned.\u201d",
      "The Alliance noted that the full slate of citywide events was still on for opening weekend, and said the kickoff ceremony would be relocated and reorganized.",
      "The cancellation presents a further challenge for the Alliance, but at least a non-political one. Organizers have already said they expected international attendance to measurably suffer as a result of concern and anger in the LGBTQ+ community over President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Trump\u2019s public antipathy for trans protections and drag shows has already prompted two international LGBTQ+ organizations, Eagle Canada and the African Human Rights Coalition, to issue warnings against traveling to the U.S. at all. The primary concern is that trans or non-binary individuals would face trouble entering the country if passport control officers enforce the administration\u2019s strict binary view of gender status.",
      "Some potential international participants have already announced plans to skip this year\u2019s events, either out of fear of harassment or as a boycott against Trump\u2019s policies. But others have called for a domestic mobilization to flood the capital.",
      "Capital Pride Alliance Executive Director Ryan Bos said that security fencing would be installed surrounding the final two-day concert and rally on a multi-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "Early hotel reservation numbers for the final World Pride weekend, June 6-8, were originally down from the previous year, according to Destination D.C., which tracks reservations.",
      "But Destination D.C. President Elliott Ferguson told reporters on Thursday that, \u201cwhat we\u2019re seeing now is a surge at the last minute, especially with the national community.\u201d",
      "Ferguson speculated that concerns about international attendance had \u201cgalvanized the local community, the national community to want to come to the city.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The nation's public television service, PBS, has filed suit against President Donald Trump's executive order that it be stripped of federal funding",
      "PBS filed suit Friday against President Donald Trump and other administration officials to block his order stripping federal funding from the 330-station public television system, three days after NPR did the same for its radio network.",
      "In its lawsuit, PBS relies on similar arguments, saying Trump was overstepping his authority and engaging in \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d because of his claim that PBS' news coverage is biased against conservatives.",
      "\u201cPBS disputes those charged assertions in the strongest possible terms,\u201d lawyer Z.W. Julius Chen wrote in the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u201cBut regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS's programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.\u201d",
      "It was the latest of many legal actions taken against the administration for its moves, including several by media organizations impacted by Trump's orders.",
      "PBS was joined as a plaintiff by one of its stations, Lakeland PBS, which serves rural areas in northern and central Minnesota. Trump's order is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the station, the lawsuit said.",
      "A PBS spokesman said that \u201cafter careful deliberation, PBS reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television\u2019s editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations.\u201d",
      "Through an executive order earlier this month, Trump told the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to stop funding the two systems. Through the corporation alone, PBS is receiving $325 million this year, most of which goes directly to individual stations.",
      "PBS, which makes much of the programming used by the stations, said it gets 22% of its revenue directly from the feds. Sixty-one percent of PBS' budget is funded through individual station dues, and the stations raise the bulk of that money through the government.",
      "Trump's order \u201cwould have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS member stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans,\u201d Chen wrote.",
      "PBS said the U.S. Department of Education has canceled a $78 million grant to the system for educational programming, used to make children's shows like \u201cSesame Street,\u201d \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog\u201d and \u201cReading Rainbow.\u201d",
      "For Minnesota residents, the order threatens the \u201cLakeland Learns\u201d education program and \u201cLakeland News,\u201d described in the lawsuit as the only television program in the region providing local news, weather and sports.",
      "Besides Trump, the lawsuit names other administration officials as defendants, including Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. PBS says its technology is used as a backup for the nationwide wireless emergency alert system.",
      "The administration has fought with several media organizations. Government-run news services like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are struggling for their lives, The Associated Press has battled with the White House over press access and the Federal Communications Commission is investigating television news divisions.",

      "Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy Awards playing Major Margaret Houlihan on the pioneering hit TV series \u201cM.A.S.H.,\" has died. She was 87.",
      "NEW YORK -- Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy Awards playing Major Margaret Houlihan, the demanding head nurse of a behind-the-lines surgical unit during the Korean War on the pioneering hit TV series \u201cM.A.S.H.,\u201d has died. She was 87.",
      "Publicist Harlan Boll says Swit died Friday at her home in New York City, likely from natural causes.",
      "Swit and Alan Alda were the longest-serving cast members on \u201cM.A.S.H.,\u201d which was based on Robert Altman\u2019s 1970 film, which was itself based on a novel by Richard Hooker, the pseudonym of H. Richard Hornberger.",
      "The CBS show aired for 11 years from 1972 to 1983, revolving around life at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, which gave the show its name. The two-and-a-half-hour finale on Feb. 28, 1983, lured over 100 million viewers, the most-watched episode of any scripted series ever.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine put \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d at No. 25 of the best TV shows of all time, while Time Out put it at No. 34. It won the Impact Award at the 2009 TV Land annual awards. It won a Peabody Award in 1975 \u201cfor the depth of its humor and the manner in which comedy is used to lift the spirit and, as well, to offer a profound statement on the nature of war.\u201d",
      "In Altman\u2019s 1970 film, Houlihan was a one-dimensional character \u2014 a prickly, rules-bound head nurse who was regularly tormented by male colleagues, who gave her the nickname \u201cHot Lips.\u201d Her intimate moments were broadcast to the entire camp after somebody planted a microphone under her bed.",
      "Sally Kellerman played Houlihan in the movie version and Swit took it over for TV, eventually deepening and creating her into a much fuller character. Her sexuality was played down and she wasn\u2019t even called \u201cHot Lips\u201d in the later years.",
      "The growing awareness of feminism in the \u201970s spurred Houlihan\u2019s transformation from caricature to real person, but a lot of the change was due to Swit\u2019s influence on the scriptwriters.",
      "\u201cAround the second or third year I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes,\u201d Swit told Suzy Kalter, author of \u201cThe Complete Book of \u2018M.A.S.H.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cTo oversimplify it, I took each traumatic change that happened in her life and kept it. I didn\u2019t go into the next episode as if it were a different character in a different play. She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.\u201d",
      "\u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d wasn\u2019t an instant hit. It finished its first season in 46th place, out of 75 network TV series, but it nabbed nine Emmy nominations. It was rewarded with a better time slot for its sophomore season, paired on Saturday nights with \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d then TV\u2019s highest-rated show. At the 1974 Emmys, it was crowned best comedy, with Alda winning as best comedy actor.",
      "The series also survived despite cast churn. In addition to Swit and Alda, the first season featured Wayne Rogers, McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville and Gary Burghoff. Harry Morgan, Mike Farrell and David Ogden Stiers would later be added, while Jamie Farr and William Christopher had expanded roles.",
      "\u201cLoretta Swit\u2019s portrayal of Margaret \u2018Hot Lips\u2019 Houlihan was groundbreaking \u2014 bringing heart, humor, and strength to one of television comedy\u2019s most enduring roles. Her talent extended well beyond that iconic character, with acclaimed work on both stage and screen that showcased her intelligence, versatility, and passion,\" National Comedy Center Executive Director Journey Gunderson said in a statement.",
      "Swit appeared in all but 11 episodes of the series, nearly four times longer than the Korean War itself, exploring issues like PTSD, sexism and racism. Swit pushed for a better representation for women.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I liked, with Loretta\u2019s prodding, was every time I had a chance to write for her character, we\u2019d get away from the Hot Lips angle and find out more about who Margaret was. She became more of a real person,\u201d Alda told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018.",
      "The series ended on a happy note for Houlihan, who spends much of the finale debating whether she wants to head to Tokyo or Belgium for her next overseas post. Ultimately she opts to return to America and work at a hospital, citing her father \u2014 a career Army man.",
      "Swit didn\u2019t personally agree that was the correct decision for a military-minded official: \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was correct for my Margaret,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment in 2023. \u201cI think her next move was Vietnam. So I didn\u2019t agree with that, but that\u2019s what they wanted her to do.\u201d",
      "But the actor did get to write the speech that Houlihan delivers to her fellow nurses on their final night together, in which she says: \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor and privilege to have worked with you. And I\u2019m very, very proud to have known you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was consumed with writing that. And I still get letters from women all over the world who became nurses because of Margaret Houlihan. To have contributed to someone\u2019s life like that is remarkable,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment.",
      "During her run, Houlihan had an affair with Hawkeye\u2019s foil, the bumbling Frank Burns, played by Linville in the TV version, and in Season 5, Houlihan returns from a stay in Tokyo engaged to a handsome lieutenant colonel, a storyline that Swit says she advocated for with the writers.",
      "\u201cI told them: \u2018Can you imagine what fun you\u2019re going to have with Larry when I come back to town and I tell him I\u2019m engaged? He\u2019ll rip the doors off of the mess tent!\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what they had him do. So we were all of the same mind.\u201d",
      "Toward the end, Swit was tempted to leave the show. She played the role of Chris Cagney in a 1981 television movie, \u201cCagney & Lacey,\u201d and was offered the part when it was picked up as a midseason series for the spring of 1982. But producers insisted she stay with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d for its last two seasons.",
      "Swit told The Florida Times-Union in 2010 she might have stayed with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d anyway. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but get better as an actor working with scripts like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in something that literate, well, we got spoiled.\u201d",
      "In 2022, James Poniewozik, The New York Times\u2019s chief television critic, looked back on the show and said it held up well: \u201cIts blend of madcap comedy and pitch-dark drama \u2014 the laughs amplifying the serious stakes, and vice versa \u2014 is recognizable in today\u2019s dramedies, from \u2018Better Things\u2019 to \u2018Barry,\u2019 that work in the DMZ between laughter and sadness.\u201d",
      "After the TV series, Swit became a vocal animal welfare activist, selling SwitHeart perfume and her memoir through her official website, with proceeds benefiting various animal-related nonprofit groups.",
      "In 1983, she married actor Dennis Holahan, whom she\u2019d met when he was a guest star on \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d They divorced in 1995.",
      "Born in Passaic, New Jersey, the daughter of Polish immigrants, Swit enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, then paid her dues for years in touring productions.",
      "In 1969, she arrived in Hollywood and was soon seen in series such as \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d \u201cHawaii Five-O,\u201d \u201cMission Impossible\u201d and \u201cBonanza.\u201d Then in 1972, she got her big break when she was asked to audition for the role of \u201cHot Lips.\u201d",
      "She would regularly return to theater, starring on Broadway in 1975 in \u201cSame Time, Next Year\u201d and \u201cThe Mystery of Edwin Drood\u201d in 1986. She was in \u201cAmorous Crossing,\u201d a romantic comedy, at Alhambra Theatre & Dining in 2010 and in North Carolina Theatre\u2019s production of \u201cMame\u201d in 2003.",

      "The lighthouse appeared overnight",
      "MARSEILLE, France -- The lighthouse appeared overnight. Painted on a wall tucked away in a quiet Marseille street, its beam aligned perfectly with the real-life shadow of a metal post on the pavement. At its center, stenciled in crisp white, are the words: \u201cI want to be what you saw in me.\u201d",
      "Banksy had struck again.",
      "On Friday, the elusive British street artist confirmed the work by posting two images on his official Instagram account \u2014 without caption or coordinates. Fans quickly identified the location as 1 Rue F\u00e9lix Fr\u00e9gier, in the Catalans district of Marseille\u2019s 7th arrondissement, near the sea.",
      "Since then, crowds have gathered at the site. Tourists snap photos. Children point. Locals who usually walk past the building stop to take a closer look.",
      "There is no official explanation for the phrase. But its emotional pull is unmistakable \u2014 a quiet plea for recognition, love or redemption. Some speculate it references a country ballad by Lonestar. Others call it a love letter. Or a lament. Or both.",
      "The image is deceptively simple: a lone lighthouse, dark and weathered, casting a stark white beam. But what gives it power is the way it plays with light \u2014 the real and the painted, the seen and the imagined. The post in front of the wall becomes part of the piece. Reality becomes the frame.",
      "Marseille\u2019s mayor, Beno\u00eet Payan, was quick to react online. \u201cMarseille x Banksy,\u201d he wrote, adding a flame emoji. By midday, the hashtag #BanksyMarseille was trending across France, and beyond.",
      "Though often political, Banksy\u2019s art is just as often personal, exploring themes of loss, longing and identity. In recent years, his works have appeared on war-ravaged buildings in Ukraine, in support of migrants crossing the Mediterranean and on walls condemning capitalism, Brexit, and police brutality.",
      "The artist, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world\u2019s best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \u201cLaugh now, but one day I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d",
      "His work has sold for millions of dollars at auction, and past murals on outdoor sites have often been stolen or removed by building owners soon after going up. In December 2023, after Banksy stenciled military drones on a stop sign in south London, a man was photographed taking down the sign with bolt cutters.

      "Former Japanese princess Mako Komuro has given birth to her first child",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Former Japanese princess Mako Komuro has given birth to her first child, palace officials confirmed Friday, though they gave no details, saying she is no longer a royal member.",
      "The Imperial Household Agency said both the mother and child are in good health, but did not disclose the baby's date of birth or gender.",
      "The former princess, 33, is a niece of Emperor Naruhito. She married a former college classmate Kei Komuro, a commoner, and renounced her royal status in 2021 as required by Japan's Imperial House Law. Days after their marriage, the couple moved to New York where her husband works as a lawyer.",
      "Officials said that while the birth involved a former royal, the palace decided to publicly confirm the news after media reports earlier this month on the baby's arrival. They added that they hoped Mako would live in a quiet environment.",
      "Mako's parents, Crown Prince Akishino and his wife Kiko, and younger siblings \u2014 Princess Kako and Prince Hisahito \u2014 are delighted and wished Mako's family happiness, officials said.",
      "Japanese tabloid magazine Josei Seven recently published images of Mako and Kei Komuro seen walking with a baby stroller in a neighborhood of New York.",
      "Mako and her husband met at Tokyo\u2019s International Christian University. They announced in September 2017 their intention to marry the following year, but the wedding was suspended for four years due to a financial dispute involving Kei Komuro's mother.",
      "Due to the controversy, Mako also declined a dowry to which she was entitled for leaving the imperial family.",
      "Mako\u2019s loss of royal status comes from the Imperial House Law, which allows only male succession.",
      "The rule leaves only Akishino and his son Hisahito in line to succeed Naruhito. A government panel is discussing a more stable succession system, but conservatives reject female succession and only plan to allow female royals to help perform public duties after marriage.",

      "LONDON -- Actor and comedian Russell Brand pleaded not guilty in a London court Friday to rape and sexual assault charges involving four women dating back more than 25 years.",
      "Brand, who turns 50 next week, denied two counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault. He said \"not guilty\u201d after each charge was read in Southwark Crown Court.",
      "His trial was scheduled for June 3, 2026 and is expected to last four to five weeks.",
      "Prosecutors said that the offenses took place between 1999 and 2005 \u2014 one in the English seaside town of Bournemouth and the other three in London.",
      "Brand didn't speak to reporters as he arrived at court wearing dark sunglasses, a suit jacket, a black collared shirt open below his chest and black jeans. In his right hand, he clutched a copy of the \u201cThe Valley of Vision,\u201d a collection of Puritan prayers.",
      "The \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor known for risqu\u00e9 stand-up routines, battles with drugs and alcohol, has dropped out of the mainstream media in recent years and built a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories, as well as discussing religion.",
      "On a five-minute prayer video he posted Monday on social media, Brand wrote: \u201cJesus, thank you for saving my life.\u201d",
      "When the charges were announced last month, he said that he welcomed the opportunity to prove his innocence.",
      "\u201cI was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord,\u201d he said in a social media video. \u201cI was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile. But what I never was was a rapist. I\u2019ve never engaged in nonconsensual activity. I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.\u201d",

      "The third accuser was a television employee who met Brand at a birthday party in a bar in 2004, where he allegedly grabbed her breasts before pulling her into a toilet and forcing her to perform oral sex.",
      "The final accuser worked at a radio station and met Brand while he was working on a spin-off of the \u201cBig Brother\u201d reality television program between 2004 and 2005. She said Brand grabbed her by the face with both hands, pushed her against a wall and kissed her before groping her breasts and buttocks.",

      "Big Ocean, the world\u2019s first K-pop group composed entirely of deaf and hard-of-hearing artists, is breaking barriers with high-tech tools and inclusive performances",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Big Ocean, a three-member K-pop group composed entirely of artists with hearing disabilities, is redefining the limits of music and performance \u2014 one beat at a time.",
      "When Big Ocean takes the stage, they seamlessly incorporate sign language into their performances. But their polished shows are built on extensive preparation using high-tech tools born from necessity \u2014 vibrating smartwatches that pulse with musical beats and LED visual metronomes that flash timing cues during practice sessions. This technological approach represents significant progress in South Korea\u2019s entertainment industry, where career opportunities for people with disabilities have historically been limited.",
      "The trio, PJ, Jiseok and Chanyeon, made their debut in April 2024 and recently wrapped a solo European tour marking their first anniversary. The band performed in four countries, including France and the U.K., while promoting their second mini-album, \u201cUnderwater,\u201d which dropped on April 20.",
      "PJ rose to prominence as a YouTuber who educated viewers about hearing disabilities. Chanyeon previously worked as an audiologist. Jiseok was a professional ski racer.",
      "To achieve the precision crucial in K-pop\u2019s demanding choreography and music, Big Ocean relies on technologies rarely seen in the genre. Members wear modified vibrating smartwatches that deliver rhythmic cues to their wrists and practice with visual metronomes \u2014 flashing light guides displayed on monitors \u2014 to help stay in sync when audio alone isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Chanyeon uses a hybrid hearing device with Bluetooth that streams music directly from mobile devices. The group also uses a pitch-checking app and AI voice conversion technology to support vocal training and enhance audio output after recordings.",
      "\u201cWe each felt rhythm differently when dancing,\u201d PJ told The Associated Press. \u201cSo when we\u2019d play the same song and dance in front of the mirror, one of us would move faster while another would move slower. To solve this timing issue, we decided to memorize everything together and create our own cues with each other.\u201d",
      "This precision becomes critical during live performances, where unexpected disruptions can derail even experienced performers. \u201cWhen we performed in France, our fans were cheering so loudly we lost the beat,\u201d said Jiseok. \u201cBut we looked at each other and quickly handled the situation \u2014 just like we practiced.\u201d",
      "Stage effects and certain musical styles create additional obstacles. \u201cWhen a lot of smoke comes up, sometimes we momentarily can\u2019t see the stage movements in front of us,\u201d PJ said. \u201cOur concentration gets disrupted instantly in those moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s no clear beat in a song, it\u2019s really hard for us to stay synchronized,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen the bass is overwhelming, it\u2019s difficult for us to catch it accurately.\u201d",
      "Despite these challenges, Big Ocean\u2019s commitment to accessibility and inclusion has inspired their global fanbase. Big Ocean\u2019s global fanbase \u2014 known as PADO \u2014 has responded with similar commitment.",
      "\u201cWhile communicating with PADO, we\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re actually learning Korean sign language for us, or learning various sign languages to communicate with us,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen we see how much they\u2019re preparing and putting in that effort, we feel so grateful.\u201d",
      "The group uses English for basic communication with international fans and incorporates Korean Sign Language, American Sign Language and International Sign to promote accessibility and inclusion.",
      "Jiseok credits BTS\u2019s RM with inspiring his musical journey. He said RM\u2019s donation to his former school \u2014 a private institution for deaf and hard of hearing students \u2014 gave him access to music and dance for the first time. \u201cWithout those learning opportunities, I probably never would have dreamed of becoming a K-pop idol,\u201d he said.",
      "Looking ahead, Big Ocean hopes to build on its growing global profile.",
      "\u201cWe recently saw Justin Bieber\u2019s Instagram post asking for music collaborators, so we sent him a DM,\u201d PJ said. \u201cAll of us would love the opportunity to work with him. And personally, I\u2019d also love to work with Billie Eilish.\u201d",
      "As the band reflects on its first year, Chanyeon said their biggest growth has been internal.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always liked playing it safe \u2014 even with food, I only ate what I was used to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut through Big Ocean, I\u2019ve gained confidence in trying new things. That\u2019s what I\u2019m most satisfied with.\u201d",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand flag printed with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d and laid on the floor of an art gallery has once again been packed away following public outcry, 30 years after protests forced the removal of the same artwork.",
      "The Suter Art Gallery in the city of Nelson said Thursday it had taken down the work by M\u0101ori artist Diane Prince due to escalating tensions and safety fears. The episode mirrored an Auckland gallery's removal of the work amid public backlash and complaints to law enforcement in 1995.",
      "This time, the flag was meant to remain on display for five months. Instead, it lasted just 19 days, reigniting long-running debates in New Zealand over artistic expression, national symbols and the country\u2019s colonial history.",
      "Police told The Associated Press on Friday that officers were investigating \u201cseveral\u201d complaints about the exhibition.",
      "The piece, titled Flagging the Future, is a cloth New Zealand flag displayed on the floor with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d stenciled across it. The flag features the British Union Jack and red stars on a blue background.",
      "The work was part of an exhibition, Diane Prince: Activist Artist, and was meant to provoke reflection on the M\u0101ori experience since New Zealand's colonization by Britain in the 19th century. Prince created the piece in 1995 in response to a government policy that limited compensation to M\u0101ori tribes for historical land theft.",
      "\u201cI have no attachment to the New Zealand flag,\u201d Prince told Radio New Zealand in 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t call myself a New Zealander. I call myself a M\u0101ori.\u201d",
      "Prince couldn\u2019t be reached immediately for comment Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s reckoning with its colonial past has gathered pace in recent decades. But there has been little appetite among successive governments to sever the country\u2019s remaining constitutional ties to Britain or change the flag to a design that doesn't feature the Union Jack.",
      "New Zealand is among countries where desecrating the national flag is considered taboo and prohibited by law. Damaging a flag in public with intent to dishonor it is punishable by a fine of up to 5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,984), but prosecutions are fleetingly rare.",
      "As in the United States and elsewhere, the country\u2019s flag is synonymous for some with military service. But for others, particularly some M\u0101ori, it\u2019s a reminder of land dispossession, and loss of culture and identity.",
      "Protests of the artwork in the city of Nelson, population 55,000, included videos posted to social media by a local woman, Ruth Tipu, whose grandfather served in the army\u2019s M\u0101ori Battalion during World War II. In one clip, she is seen lifting the flag from the floor and draping it over another artwork, an action Tipu said she would repeat daily.",
      "A veterans\u2019 group also denounced the piece as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d City council member Tim Skinner said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the work\u2019s inclusion.",
      "But others welcomed it. Nelson\u2019s deputy mayor, Rohan O\u2019Neill-Stevens, posted on social media \u201cin strong defense of artistic expression and the right for us all to be challenged and confronted by art.\u201d",
      "The work was perhaps expected to provoke controversy and in the exhibition\u2019s opening days, The Suter Gallery defended its inclusion. But a statement on its Facebook page late Thursday said a \u201csharp escalation in the tone and nature of the discourse, moving well beyond the bounds of respectful debate\u201d had prompted the flag\u2019s removal.",
      "\u201cThis should not be interpreted as a judgement on the artwork or the artist\u2019s intent,\u201d the statement said. The gallery didn\u2019t detail specific incidents of concern and a gallery spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for an interview on Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s Police said in a statement Friday that while officers were investigating complaints, they weren\u2019t called to any disturbances at the exhibition. Prince said when she revived the work in 2024 that threats of prosecution by law enforcement had prompted its removal from the Auckland gallery in 1995.",

      "As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it",
      "NEW YORK -- As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it.",
      "We should all be so alive and so remembered at his age. Fogerty, in the midst of an international tour, played a rowdy 100-minute set Thursday night to an adoring, near-capacity audience at Manhattan's Beacon Theatre. Crowd members spanned from those likely to remember \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cFortunate Son\u201d and other Creedence Clearwater Revival hits when first released a half-century ago to those looking young enough to have heard about them through their grandparents.",
      "At least from a distance, Fogerty didn't look or sound much different from his prime with Creedence, which was rarely off the charts between 1969 and 1971. He wore his trademark flannel shirt; had the same shaggy haircut, although with his bangs brushed back; sang with a vintage roar that has mellowed only slightly; and even played the same guitar, a Rickenbacker, that he had acquired back in the late '60s.",
      "Fogerty presented himself as a proud rock \u2018n' roller, and a very proud family man. His band includes two of his sons on guitar, Shane and Tyler, with daughter Kelsy briefly joining them on a third guitar. Off to the side was his wife, Julie, whom he praised as the love and the hero of his life, if only because she gave one of the greatest gifts an old rock star could ask for: She helped win back rights to his song catalogue. Fogerty had battled over his copyrights for decades, and at one point found himself being sued for plagiarizing one of his Creedence hits, which at the time he didn\u2019t own.",
      "He has marked his victory with an upcoming album, \u201cLegacy,\u201d for which he recorded new versions of 20 songs. If you were in the house Thursday night, you couldn't help hearing about it. A promotional film about \u201cLegacy\u201d opened the show and Fogerty mentioned it again before his encore set. Both the album, subtitled \u201cThe Creedence Clearwater Revival Years,\u201d and his concert tell a story of how he wants to look back.",
      "As Fogerty noted at one point Thursday night, Creedence Clearwater Revival soared to the highest heights before imploding bitterly in the early \u201870s and never again recording or touring together. Only Creedence diehards would have known the identity of the other band members \u2014 drummer Doug Clifford, bassist Stu Cook, and guitarist Tom Fogerty, John\u2019s brother, who died in 1990. Their names were never mentioned, their faces near-invisible among the rush of images that appeared Thursday on a screen behind Fogerty and his band. The new tracks on \u201cLegacy,\u201d each labeled \u201cJohn's Version,\u201d leave only John Fogerty from the original group.",
      "The Beacon show was very much about where is he now, and how much he likes it. He dashed about the stage, rocked out on his Rickenbacker with the joy of a teenager on air guitar and even poured himself champagne. Fans clapped and danced, while being showered with confetti and dazzled with lasers and fog. The more informed sang along with \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain\u201d and the baseball anthem \u201cCenterfield,\" Fogerty's most famous post-Creedence song. Virtually all stood and cheered to serenade the night\u2019s guest of honor, whose birthday was the day before.",

      "ATLANTA -- The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia's death row from execution.",
      "Executions in Georgia were halted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the state attorney general's office entered into an agreement with lawyers for people on death row to set the terms under which they could resume for a specific group of prisoners. At least one of those conditions, having to do with the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, has not been met, and seeking an execution date for a prisoner covered by the agreement would breach the agreement, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram ruled.",
      "The agreement includes three conditions that had to be met before executions could be set for the affected prisoners: the expiration of the state\u2019s COVID-19 judicial emergency, the resumption of normal visitation at state prisons and the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cto all members of the public.\u201d Once those conditions were met, the state agreed to give three months' notice before pursuing an execution warrant for one of the prisoners covered by the agreement and six months' notice for the rest.",
      "The state has argued that the agreement should no longer apply, contending the conditions have been met. But defense attorneys say it's still valid because the vaccine isn't yet available to infants under 6 months old, and visitation at state prisons has not returned to normal.",
      "Ingram's ruling, issued Friday, addressed only the vaccination question. She plans to handle the visitation issue separately.",
      "Ingram wrote that the state's arguments \u201call boil down to an attempt to rewrite the Agreement.\u201d The state is \u201c(u)nhappy with the language it drafted\u201d and wants to change it so that the condition would be satisfied once vaccines are available to \u201cmost members of the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut courts cannot rewrite contracts to relieve a party of their regrets,\u201d she wrote. She ruled that the agreement is \u201cbinding and enforceable,\u201d that the vaccination condition hasn't been met and that seeking an execution warrant before the requirements have been met would breach the agreement.",
      "The state attorney general's office plans to appeal, a spokesperson said Tuesday.",
      "Ingram noted that the Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical trials for infants under 6 months old, and newborns receive other vaccines. That shows it is possible for the COVID-19 vaccine to ultimately be available for that age group, and the state should have foreseen that that could take years, she wrote.",
      "Experts for both sides had testified that it was probable that the COVID-19 vaccine would eventually become available to babies under the age of 6 months, Ingram wrote.",
      "That was before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed U.S. health secretary. Kennedy last week announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. A few days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website, which had said those groups should get the shots, was revised to say the vaccinations \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "The agreement covers fewer than 10 of the 34 people currently on Georgia's death row.",
      "While Georgia stopped carrying out executions during the pandemic, death penalty cases continued to wind their way through the court system, and as people exhausted their appeals, they became eligible for execution.",
      "A committee of a judicial task force on COVID-19 in early 2021 instructed lawyers for people on death row and the state attorney general\u2019s office to come up with terms under which executions could safely resume. The two sides reached the agreement in April 2021.",
      "The agreement only applied to people on death row whose requests to have their appeals reheard were denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals while the judicial emergency was in place. The agreement was to remain in effect through Aug. 1, 2022, or one year from the date on which the conditions were met \u2014 whichever was later.",
      "The legal fight arose from a lawsuit filed when officials set a May 2022 execution date for Virgil Delano Presnell Jr. The Federal Defender Program, which represents Presnell, said the state had violated the agreement because the conditions hadn\u2019t all been met.",
      "Based on that argument, a Fulton County Superior Court judge halted the execution less than 24 hours before it was to take place, and the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in December 2022 that the agreement was a binding contract.",
      "People on death row who are not covered by the agreement have since become eligible for execution. One of them, Willie James Pye, was put to death in March 2024.",

      "A judge says the federal Bureau of Prisons must keep providing hormone therapy to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment",
      "WASHINGTON -- The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that the bureau's own medical staff has deemed appropriate.",
      "The judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don\u2019t match.",
      "\u201cIn light of the plaintiffs\u2019 largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The bureau doesn\u2019t dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.",
      "The Republican president\u2019s executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren\u2019t spent \u201cfor the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d",
      "Lamberth\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.",
      "The lawsuit\u2019s named plaintiffs include Alishea Kingdom, a transgender woman who was prescribed hormone therapy injections and approved to receive social accommodations, including women\u2019s undergarments and cosmetics. Kingdom was denied her hormone shot three times after Trump signed his order, but she had it restored roughly a week after she sued. Her access to feminine undergarments hasn\u2019t been restored, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cIn Ms. Kingdom\u2019s case, there is no indication at all that the BOP means to leave her hormone therapy in place long-term; indeed, as noted above, she was informed by BOP personnel that the decision to resume her treatment was a consequence of this litigation itself, raising the specter that her treatments might be discontinued as soon as the litigation has concluded,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "Trump\u2019s order also directed the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that \u201cmales are not detained in women\u2019s prisons.\u201d In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men\u2019s facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.",
      "The judge said there's no evidence Trump or prison officials considered the harm the new polices could do to transgender inmates.",
      "\u201cThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged irreparable harm because they are all currently receiving hormone medications. But it suffices to say that all three plaintiffs\u2019 access to hormone therapy is, as best the Court can tell, tenuous,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, in 1987.",

      "A law firm says the number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000",
      "The number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000, a British law firm said on Monday.",
      "Rylands Garth, based in London, said more than 520 ex-players from rugby union and rugby league joined the lawsuit by Friday last week, which was the deadline for new applicants set by a court ahead of a hearing in July and before the case potentially goes to trial next year.",
      "It takes the total number of players who are part of the lawsuit to approximately 1,100, Rylands Garth said in a statement.",
      "The former players contend, according to Rylands Garth, that \u201crugby governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect them from the impacts of concussive and sub-concussive blows during their playing careers, despite knowing of the risks.\u201d",
      "Claimants are seeking compensation from World Rugby, the English Rugby Football Union and Welsh Rugby Union \u2014 governing bodies in 15-a-side rugby \u2014 and the English Rugby Football League and British Amateur Rugby League Association \u2014 from 13-a-side rugby league \u2014 for lost earnings, medical bills and care costs associated with their injuries, the firm said.",
      "\u201cRylands Garth is also calling for urgent and substantive reform of the game to better protect the safety of current and future players \u2014 including the creation of an independent brain health ombudsman for the sport,\u201d it said.",
      "Among those to have previously joined the class action was World Cup-winning former England hooker Steve Thompson, former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman and former Wales flanker Alix Popham.",
      "\u201cThis surge in claimants exposes the deep-rooted issues in rugby,\u201d Rylands Garth said, adding: \"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement issued by World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU, the governing bodies said they \u201care aware of the latest update shared by the claimants\u2019 legal representatives with the final number of claimants.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe now await full details of their diagnosis and the claims being made. Our thoughts are with any former player facing challenges.",
      "\u201cAcross the game, we continue to build on a strong foundation of world-leading initiatives designed to make rugby union as safe as possible.\"",
      "That includes \u201csmart mouthguard technology in the elite game, trials of lower tackle height in the community game, and the continued rollout of brain health services to support former players.\u201d",
      "Rylands Garth said it also represents approximately 130 former soccer players who are taking similar legal action against soccer governing bodies. The next court hearing for the soccer case is due on June 26.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.",
      "The 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.",
      "Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.",
      "Kennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d",
      "His comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.",
      "Some worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.",
      "Ohio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who's 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d",
      "While announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.",
      "For Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.",
      "Daniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.",
      "\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d",
      "The Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.",
      "\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d",
      "Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.",
      "Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.",
      "At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.",
      "Lamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.",
      "\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d",
      "Copeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.",
      "Ashley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.",
      "\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d",
      "Doctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.",
      "Kennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.",
      "Both he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.",
      "Last week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.",
      "Eileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she'd like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about what\u2019s the cause but how do we help,\u201d she said.",
      "For Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s study may hold answers she\u2019s wrestled with since Daniel was diagnosed many years ago. She\u2019s aware that research has found no link between vaccines and autism, but she\u2019s still not convinced. Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.",
      "\u201cWhy did this happen to him?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years and years and years.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "A ban on disposable vapes has come into force across the U.K. as the British government aims to stem their illegal use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment",
      "LONDON -- A ban on disposable vapes came into force across the U.K. on Sunday as the British government aims to stem their use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment.",
      "The ban makes it illegal for any retailer \u2014 online or in-store \u2014 to sell vapes, whether they contain nicotine or not. They will still be able to sell reusable vapes.",
      "The crackdown follows the soaring use of disposable vapes in schools and a rising tide of trash as users dispose of the vapes. It is estimated that as many as 5 million disposable vapes are thrown in bins or littered every week across the U.K., rather than being recycled.",
      "A number of countries are seeking to regulate the vape market, which has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Australia outlawed the sale of vapes outside pharmacies last year in some of the world\u2019s toughest restrictions on electronic cigarettes, while Belgium became the first European Country to ban the use of disposable vapes at the start of this year. California has been at the forefront of bringing in new regulations in the U.S.",
      "The U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said usage among young people remained too high, and the ban would \u201cput an end to their alarming rise in school playgrounds and the avalanche of rubbish flooding the nation\u2019s streets.\u201d",
      "Also known as single-use vapes, disposable vapes are non-refillable and unable to be recharged, and are typically thrown away with general waste or just thrown on the street. Even when they are recycled, they need to be taken apart by hand, while their batteries are a fire risk to recycling facilities and can leak harmful chemicals into the environment and potentially harming wildlife.",
      "Businesses were given six months to prepare for the change by selling any existing stock. Rogue traders who continue to sell them risk a fine of 200 ($260) in the first instance, followed by an unlimited fine or jail time for repeat offending.",
      "The U.K. Vaping Industry Association said its members had moved quickly to comply with the June 1 deadline, but warned of \u201cserious unintended consequences\u201d emanating from too much regulation.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that this ban will encourage former smokers who have already transitioned from cigarettes, which kill 220 people every day in the U.K, to return to combustible tobacco or opt for unregulated vapes,\" said its director general, John Dunne.",

      "French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, known as the inventor of the abortion pill, died on Friday aged 98 at his home in Paris",
      "ROME -- French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, best known as the inventor of the abortion pill, died on Friday aged 98 at his home in Paris, his institute said in a statement.",
      "Both a doctor and a researcher, Baulieu was known around the world for the scientific, medical and social significance of his work on steroid hormones.",
      "\u201cHis research was guided by his attachment to the progress made possible by science, his commitment to women\u2019s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,\u201d the Institut Baulieu said in the statement posted on its website.",
      "Born Etienne Blum in Strasbourg on Dec. 12, 1926, he took the name \u201c\u00c9mile Baulieu\u201d when he joined the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation at the age of 15.",
      "An endocrinologist with a doctorate in medicine completed in 1955 and one in science eight years later, in 1963 Baulieu founded a pioneering research unit working on hormones at INSERM, the French institute for health and medical research. He remained as head of the unit until 1997.",
      "He is best known for his development, in 1982, of RU 486, the so-called \u201cabortion pill\u201d that changed the lives of millions of women throughout the world, offering them the possibility of voluntary medical termination of pregnancy, in physical and psychological safety.",
      "The Institut Baulieu said it was \u201ca non-invasive method, less aggressive and less delayed than surgery,\u201d noting that following his discovery the researcher faced fierce criticism and even threats from opponents of women's abortion rights.",
      "\u201cEven today, access to this method is opposed, banned in some countries, and is currently being challenged in the United States, where it is the most widely used abortion method,\u201d the institute added.",
      "Baulieu\u2019s research into DHEA, a hormone whose secretion and anti-aging activity he had discovered, led him to work on neurosteroids -- or steroids of the nervous system. He also developed an original treatment to combat depression, for which a clinical trial is currently underway in several university hospitals.",
      "In 2008, he founded the Institut Baulieu to understand, prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.",
      "Honored with the grand crosses of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur (legion of honor) and the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (national order of merit), he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1982, which he chaired in 2003 and 2004.",
      "He was a member of the national advisory committee on life sciences and health (1996-2002) and received numerous awards, both in France and abroad.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Baulieu in a post on X, calling him \u201ca beacon of courage\u201d and \u201ca progressive mind who enabled women to win their freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cFew French people have changed the world to such an extent,\u201d he added.",
      "After the death of his first wife, Yolande Compagnon, he remarried, to Simone Harari Baulieu. He is survived by three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, his institute said.",

      "Attorneys for a woman who had challenged Kentucky's near-total ban on abortion have dropped the lawsuit",
      "Attorneys for a woman who sued Kentucky seeking to restore the right to an abortion have dropped their challenge to the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "The attorneys filed a motion Friday to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit, but did not give a reason for seeking to drop the case. The lawsuit had been filed last year in state court in Louisville on behalf of a woman who was seven weeks pregnant at the time and identified only by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, which had represented the woman, said in a statement it would not give additional details about the dismissal.",
      "\u201cPeople have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,\u201d said Amber Duke, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cWe are strategizing our next steps in this fight.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities. The trigger law took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cKentuckians can be proud that our pro-life values won the day today and innocent lives will continue to be saved as a result,\u201d Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican, posted on X.",
      "The trigger law bans abortions except to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. Republican lawmakers earlier this year inserted several new medical exceptions, though abortion-rights supporters said the exceptions don't add clarity and in fact undermine the judgment of doctors by remaining silent on other situations.",

      "Americans are losing an array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee.",
      "State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big \u2014 and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities \u2014 are being hollowed out.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed.",
      "Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.",
      "The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That's one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.",
      "\"It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d",
      "Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.",
      "Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.",
      "\u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said.",
      "The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated.",
      "The Mecklenburg County department, with \"Protecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.",
      "\u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d",
      "What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.",
      "Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d",
      "State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.",
      "Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department's budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.",
      "At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening.",
      "\u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.",
      "A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.",
      "The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.",
      "A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d",
      "HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.",
      "In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.",
      "In Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.",
      "The cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d",
      "CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.",
      "So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.",
      "She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines.",
      "\u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.",
      "With health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California\u2019s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.",
      "But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation \u2014 some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County\u2019s health director. \u201cWhat really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. ... We were still pretty trim, but we weren\u2019t just, like, bones.\u201d",
      "In Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 \u2014 slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs.",
      "In Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu.",
      "The cuts are not over.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC\u2019s budget, enough to cut the agency\u2019s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities.",
      "Michael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States.",
      "\u201cWithout the appropriate funding, we can\u2019t properly address these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.\u201d",

      "The nation\u2019s top public health agency has posted new recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women may \u2014 but no longer should \u2014 get COVID-19 vaccinations",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get COVID-19 vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.",
      "The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "But the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt's not as bad as it could have been.\"",
      "Kennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.",
      "A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.",
      "\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\"",
      "That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.",
      "Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "A CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.",
      "But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.",
      "The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \"incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.",

      "Carlos Alcaraz has been wearing nasal strips in some matches since last season",
      "PARIS -- If more tennis players find themselves breathing easier, it might just be thanks to Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "The four-time Grand Slam champion, whose bid for a second consecutive French Open title was scheduled to continue with a third-round match Friday night, has often worn a nasal strip in matches since last season \u2014 although not during his first two contests at Roland-Garros this week \u2014 and the sport's other athletes took note.",
      "After all, if Alcaraz finds something useful on the court, their thinking goes, maybe it makes sense to give the adhesive bands a shot.",
      "\u201cI saw Carlos playing in it,\u201d said 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, a semifinalist in Paris last year and the No. 6 women's seed this time. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty interested to try and see if there is really a difference. If he plays matches in it, then probably there is.\u201d",
      "At the 2024 season-ending ATP Finals last November, Alcaraz said: \u201cIt is something that I\u2019m going to wear more often. I could recover better between points.\u201d",
      "Once associated with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, the bands, which essentially look like a Band-Aid worn across the bridge of the nose, are popping up on tennis courts \u2014 sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of curiosity.",
      "They are designed to open the nostrils slightly, making it easier to breathe through the nose. Originally marketed to reduce snoring, they\u2019re being embraced to enhance air intake during physical exertion.",
      "The idea is simple: Better breathing could mean better oxygen intake.",
      "In practice, the science is less convincing.",
      "In 2021, Brazilian academic Ricardo Dinardi reviewed more than 600 studies on nasal strips and found they didn\u2019t make a real difference in how much air athletes took in, their heart rate or how strenuous exercise felt.",
      "\u201cThe effect on athletic performance is mostly placebo,\u201d Dinardi said. \u201cBut in elite sports, even perceived benefits can count.\u201d",
      "Three-time major finalist Casper Ruud, who wore the strips in matches earlier this year, knows the evidence is shaky. But he still liked using them \u2014 both on the court and while sleeping. Like Alcaraz, Ruud did not wear one in Paris before his second-round exit.",
      "But he has been testing a prototype of a different version.",
      "\u201cI tried out a device that\u2019s very early in development. It will be a bit more comfortable to wear, because it\u2019s inside the nose and it looks like I have this bullring under,\u201d said Ruud, who was the runner-up at Roland-Garros to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023. \u201cIt will return, don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
      "For other players, like Nicol\u00e1s Jarry, the strips are more than a trend \u2014 they\u2019re a necessity. After nasal surgery in 2020, the Chilean still needed help to draw air into his nose, so he puts them on for every practice and every match he plays.",
      "\u201cWithout it, I cannot breathe. My nostrils shut when I try,\u201d he said, inhaling to demonstrate for a reporter. \u201cOthers don\u2019t have that issue and still use them.\u201d",
      "Jarry definitely has noticed a recent spike in interest among players. He said that even though he's worn the strips for years, including at this French Open, other competitors on tour never asked about them \u2014 until Alcaraz started wearing one last year, sometimes in black, sometimes in pink.",

      "Russia took weeks to present to Ukraine with a \u201cmemorandum\u201d setting out its conditions for a ceasefire, as well as key guidelines for a comprehensive treaty to end the more than 3-year-old war. To practically no one\u2019s surprise, it\u2019s a list of the Kremlin\u2019s longstanding, maximalist demands that Kyiv and its Western allies see as nonstarters.",
      "Ukraine had set its negotiating stance before Monday\u2019s direct peace talks in Istanbul, emphasizing its readiness to declare a 30-day ceasefire immediately without preconditions that was proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Kyiv reaffirmed its refusal to abandon a bid for NATO membership and rejected acknowledgment of Russia's annexation of any of its regions.",
      "Both sides have established mutually exclusive red lines that make any quick deal unlikely.",
      "Moscow's demands, published in the Russian media, make it clear that President Vladimir Putin is determined to ensure the fulfillment of the goals in Ukraine he set when he launched the invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Key points of the Russian and Ukrainian documents:",
      "Russia offered Ukraine a choice of two options for establishing a 30-day ceasefire.",
      "One option is that Ukraine must withdraw its forces from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 the four regions Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully captured.",
      "The second option described by Moscow as the \u201cpackage\u201d proposal, presses Ukraine to halt its mobilization efforts and freeze Western arms deliveries \u2014 conditions that were suggested earlier by Putin.",
      "On top of that, the document also demands that Ukraine begin demobilizing its military, halt any redeployment of forces and ban the presence of any third-country forces on its soil.",
      "The \u201cpackage\u201d option further proposes that Ukraine end martial law and hold elections, after which the two countries could sign a comprehensive peace treaty.",
      "The Russian document declares that conditions for peace must include the \u201cinternational legal recognition\u201d of Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and its 2022 annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.",
      "It says a future peace treaty should have Ukraine declare its neutral status between Russia and the West, and abandon its bid to join NATO. The document demands that Ukraine limit the size of its armed forces, recognize Russian as an official language on par with Ukrainian, ban \u201cglorification and propaganda of Nazism and neo-Nazism\u201d and dissolve nationalist groups -\u2013 conditions reflecting Putin\u2019s goals from the outset of his invasion.",
      "The false allegations that neo-Nazi groups were shaping Ukraine\u2019s politics under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, have been vehemently dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies.",
      "In Russia\u2019s view, a comprehensive peace treaty should also see both countries lift all sanctions and restrictions, abandon any claims to compensation for wartime damage, resume trade and communications, and reestablish diplomatic ties. It also suggests that the peace treaty between Russian and Ukraine be endorsed by a resolution of the U.N. Security Council.",
      "The memorandum that Ukraine submitted to Moscow before the talks and shared with its allies emphasized the need for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to set stage for peace negotiations.",
      "It reaffirmed Ukraine's consistent rejection of Russian demands for neutral status as an attack on its sovereignty, declaring it is free to choose its alliances and adding that its NATO membership will depend on consensus with the alliance.",
      "It emphasized Kyiv's rejection of any restrictions on the size and other parameters of its armed forces, as well as curbs on the presence of foreign troops on its soil.",
      "Ukraine's memorandum also opposed recognizing any Russian territorial gains, while describing the current line of contact as a starting point in negotiations.",
      "The document noted the need for international security guarantees to ensure the implementation of peace agreements and prevent further aggression.",
      "The Ukrainian peace proposal also demanded the return of all deported and illegally displaced Ukrainian children and an \u201call-for-all\u201d prisoner exchange.",
      "It held the door open to gradual lifting of some of the sanctions against Russia if it abides by the agreeme",
      "The sharply conflicting demands leave little hope for any quick progress in talks.",
      "By maintaining its maximalist demands, Moscow is seemingly unfazed by repeated threats of sanctions by the West or other pressure to make real concessions.",
      "Some observers see the Russian memorandum as a way by Moscow to formalize its negotiation position.",
      "\u201cEven an unsigned document gives the Kremlin a firmer diplomatic foothold,\u201d said Moscow-based defense analyst Sergei Poletaev.",
      "Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center noted that the document reflects Putin\u2019s key goal of of securing a \u201cfriendly\u201d Ukraine without a full-fledged military or ties of any kind with its Western allies.",
      "She noted the Russian document offers Ukraine a choice between the two options because Moscow knows that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the four regions \"is not viable and seeks to push Kyiv toward the second as the primary course.\u201d At the same time, Moscow\u2019s memorandum appears to indicate that \u201cRussia is open to considering leaving parts of the annexed regions that it does not control to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Stanovaya said Moscow\u2019s maximalist demands mean that \u201cthe fighting is set to continue, even if bilateral interactions persist.\u201d",

      "CAIRO -- An attack on an aid convoy in Sudan\u2019s  Darfur region left five people dead, the United Nations said Tuesday, and the warring parties in the northeast African nation traded blame for the attack.",
      "The attack on the 15-truck convoy came Monday night near the Rapid Support Forces-controlled town of Koma in North Darfur province. It was trying to reach el-Fasher city, according to a joint statement from the World Food Program and UNICEF. Both agencies called for an investigation into the attack.",
      "Sudan was plunged into a war more than two years ago, when tensions between Sudan's army and its rival paramilitary RSF exploded with street battles in the capital of Khartoum that quickly spread across the country.",
      "Monday night's attack, in which many trucks were burned and aid was damaged, also wounded members of the convoy, the statement said. It didn\u2019t say who was responsible for the attack.",
      "\u201cIt is devastating that the supplies have not reached the vulnerable children and families they were intended to,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The WFP and UNICEF said they were negotiating to complete the trip to el-Fasher, which is besieged by RSF, after traveling more than 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) from the eastern city of Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which serves as an interim seat for the country\u2019s military-allied government.",
      "The RSF said in a statement the convoy was hit by a military aircraft in a \u201cpreplanned attack.\u201d Footage shared by the RSF showed burned vehicles carrying what appeared to be flour bags.",
      "The military-led government, however, rejected the accusation and said in a statement that aid trucks were \u201ctreacherously attacked by assault drones operated by the rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia.\u201d",
      "The Resistance Committees in el-Fasher tracked the fighting in and around the city and blamed the paramilitaries for the attack, saying the RSF statement aimed to \u201cmislead public opinion and evade accountability.\u201d",
      "El-Fasher, more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Khartoum, is one of the last strongholds of the Sudanese military in Darfur. The region has been under RSF siege since May 2024.",
      "Monday\u2019s attack was the latest on aid operations in the past two years. Last week, WFP\u2019s premises in el-Fasher were bombed, damaging a workshop, office building and clinic, according to the statement.",
      "The war has created the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. It has driven about 13 million people from their homes, including over 4 million who crossed into neighboring countries. Parts of Sudan have been pushed into famine.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, according to the U.N. and international rights groups.",

      "BAMAKO, Mali -- Extremists have killed dozens of soldiers in an attack on a military base in Mali, civil society and military sources said Tuesday, in the latest militant violence in West Africa's restive Sahel region.",
      "The attack on Sunday on the base in Boulkessi, near the border with Burkina Faso, killed at least 60 soldiers and wounded 40 more, a civil society activist in the area told The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.",
      "The al-Qaida-linked JNIM group claimed responsibility.",
      "A military source told the AP there were around 280 soldiers in the base, and \u201call of those who didn\u2019t die were taken prisoner by the terrorists.\u201d The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.",
      "Mali's army acknowledged the attack in a statement Monday, adding that soldiers had fought \u201cto their last breath.\u201d It did not provide an exact death toll.",
      "Mali, along with neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger, has battled an insurgency by armed groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, they have expelled French forces and turned to Russia\u2019s mercenary units for security assistance.",
      "In a separate attack on Monday, JNIM claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on a military airport, a military base and army checkpoints in the northern town of Timbuktu.",
      "Mali\u2019s army said Monday on social media it repelled the attack and that 13 extremists had been killed. It did not say whether any soldiers were killed.",

      "Timbuktu residents said they heard heavy gunfire and saw armed men enter the town on motorcycles. They spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals.",
      "Rida Lyammouri, a Sahel expert at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, said the high level of coordination in the two attacks shows that JNIM had been planning them for a while.",

      "A new report says that a record 38 million metric tons of sargassum piled up across the Caribbean and nearby areas in May, with more expected this month",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A record amount of sargassum piled up across the Caribbean and nearby areas in May, and more is expected this month, according to a new report.",
      "The brown prickly algae is suffocating shorelines from Puerto Rico to Guyana and beyond, disrupting tourism, killing wildlife and even releasing toxic gases that forced one school in the French Caribbean island of Martinique to temporarily close.",
      "The amount \u2014 38 million metric tons \u2014 is the biggest quantity of algae observed across the Caribbean Sea, the western and eastern Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico since scientists began studying the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt in 2011, said Brian Barnes, an assistant research professor at the University of South Florida who worked on the report published on Monday by the University of South Florida\u2019s Optical Oceanography Lab.",
      "The previous record was set in June 2022, with some 22 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cThe peaks just seem to keep getting bigger and bigger year after year,\u201d he said.",
      "But scientists don\u2019t know why yet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a supremely satisfying answer.\u201d",
      "Three different types of sargassum exist in the Caribbean and nearby areas, reproducing asexually as they remain afloat thanks to tiny air sacs. They thrive in different ways depending on sunlight, nutrients and water temperature, factors that scientists are currently studying, Barnes said.",
      "Experts also have said that agricultural runoff, warming waters and changes in wind, current and rain could have an effect.",
      "While large clumps of algae in the open ocean are what Barnes called a \u201chealthy, happy ecosystem\u201d for creatures ranging from tiny shrimp to endangered sea turtles, sargassum near or on shore can wreak havoc.",
      "It can block sunlight that coral reefs need to survive, and if the algae sinks, it can smother reefs and sea grasses. Once it reaches shore, the creatures living in the algae die or are picked off by birds, Barnes said.",
      "Huge piles of stinky seaweed also are a headache for the Caribbean, where tourism often generates big money for small islands.",
      "\u201cIt is a challenge, but it\u2019s certainly not affecting every single inch of the Caribbean,\u201d said Frank Comito, special adviser to the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association.",
      "In the popular tourist spot of Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, officials have invested in barriers to prevent sargassum from reaching the shore, he said.",
      "In the Dutch Caribbean territory of St. Maarten, crews with backhoes were dispatched in late May as part of an emergency clean-up after residents complained of strong smells of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which can affect a person\u2019s respiratory system.",
      "\u201cThe smell is quite terrible,\u201d Barnes said.",
      "Meanwhile, in the French Caribbean, officials expect to soon use storage barges and an upgraded special vessel that can collect several tons of seaweed a day.",
      "The sargassum \u201cdisfigures our coasts, prevents swimming and makes life impossible for local residents,\u201d French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou recently told reporters.",
      "But Comito said such vessels are \u201cmassively expensive\u201d and not a popular option, noting that another option \u2014 using heavy equipment \u2014- is labor-intensive.",
      "\u201cYou have to be careful because there could be sea turtle eggs affected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can go in there and massively rake and scrape the whole thing.\u201d",
      "Some Caribbean islands struggle financially, so most of the cleanup is done by hotels, with some offering guests refunds or a free shuttle to unaffected beaches.",
      "Every year, the amount of sargassum expands in late spring, peaks around summer and starts to decline in the late fall or early winter, Barnes said.",
      "The new record set is hardly stationary \u2014 experts said they expect even more sargassum for June.",

      "Araghchi\u2019s visit is his first since October, which came at the height of the Israel-Hezbollah war that ended a month later with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. The war killed more than 4,000 in Lebanon, displaced over 1 million people and caused destruction that the World Bank said will coast $11 billion in reconstruction.",

      "The visit also comes after the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad was removed from power in December by insurgent group\u2019s opposed to Iran\u2019s influence in the region. Assad was one of Tehran\u2019s closest allies in the Arab world and his country was a main link for the flow of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Appeals judges at the International Criminal Court gave a final greenlight Tuesday for the tribunal\u2019s first in absentia hearing by allowing the next step in proceedings against notorious fugitive Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony.",
      "The Hague-based court has scheduled a so-called confirmation of charges hearing at which prosecutors will present evidence in September to back up charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity against Kony, despite his whereabouts being unknown.",
      "Kony, the leader of the brutal Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, faces dozens of counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, sexual enslavement and rape.",
      "The ICC's rules do not allow trials entirely in absentia but can in some circumstances move forward with a confirmation of charges even if the suspect is not in custody.",
      "Kony\u2019s court appointed lawyers had argued his fair trial rights would be violated if the proceedings continued without their client.",
      "Judge Erdenebalsuren Damdin said the court has \u201cadequately robust safeguards\u201d for suspects to allow the confirmation of charges hearing to be held in absentia.",
      "The case had been seen as a trial balloon for the court moving forward with other cases where the suspect is not in custody, such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "However, the Kony decision was limited to situations where the wanted person has fled ICC custody or cannot be found, says Luigi Prosperi, an international criminal law expert at the University of Utrecht. Kony \u201cis a very peculiar situation,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "Kony was thrust into the global spotlight in 2012 when a video about his alleged crimes went viral. Despite the attention and international efforts to capture him, he is still at large.",
      "The LRA began its attacks in Uganda in the 1980s, when Kony sought to overthrow the government. After being pushed out of Uganda, the militia terrorized villages in Congo, Central African Republic and South Sudan. It was notorious for using child soldiers, mutilating civilians and enslaving women.",
      "In 2021, the court convicted Dominic Ongwen, a one-time child soldier who morphed into a brutal LRA commander of dozens of war crimes and crimes against humanity, ranging from multiple murders to forced marriages.",

      "Resource-rich Mongolia is facing political uncertainty following the resignation of its prime minister in the wake of protests over endemic corruption in the landlocked Asian country, squeezed between China and Russia",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Resource-rich Mongolia is facing political uncertainty following the resignation early on Tuesday of its prime minister in the wake of protests over endemic corruption in the landlocked Asian country, squeezed between China and Russia.",
      "Before he lost the confidence vote in the parliament, Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai warned that his removal could undermine Mongolia\u2019s fledgling democracy. The vote followed weeks of protests sparked by reports of lavish spending by his son and calls for him to step down.",
      "The reports, which cited expensive jewelry and helicopter rides for the son's female companion, underscored the vast gap between Mongolians who have grown extremely wealthy off the country's exports and much of the rest of the population, mired in poverty.",
      "Here is a look at why what is happening in Mongolia matters:",
      "Mongolia, a country of about 3.5 million people, borders Russia to the north and China to the south. Its stunning alpine mountains interspersed with vast deserts hold an abundance of coal, copper and other natural resources used in high-tech manufacturing.",
      "The question of who benefits from the wealth has been a key issue since Mongolia began negotiating with foreign mining giants \u2014 rumors of secret deals and under-the-table payments have circulated for years.",
      "After Mongolia threw off Communism at the end of the Cold War, it lost generous Soviet Union aid packages. Since then, it has been slowly becoming a democracy but is struggling to avoid falling into debt while holding Chinese and Russian interests at bay.",
      "China is a particularly important neighbor as its ruling Communist Party buys up 92% of Mongolia\u2019s exports.",
      "Over the years, the capital of Ulaanbaataar transformed itself from a city of clunky Soviet-era buildings surrounded by traditional herders' felt tents known as gers, into a metropolis of shopping malls and fancy hotels.",
      "The protesters have said the country\u2019s mineral riches have benefited business interests and the wealthy, while many Mongolians still live in poverty.",
      "Early on Tuesday morning, Oyun-Erdene only got 44 votes of support in the 126-seat legislature \u2014 the State Great Khural \u2014 well short of the 64 needed, according to the head of the counting commission, M. Narantuya-nara.",
      "Oyun-Erdene accepted defeat, saying it had been an honor to serve the nation through the coronavirus pandemic, Russia's war on Ukraine and the ongoing strife over U.S. tariffs.",
      "But he also warned of the threat of a \u201cspider\u2019s web\u201d of special interests that he said are working to hold the Mongolian people back.",
      "Oyun-Erdene, who ran a coalition government, will remain prime minister until his replacement is elected in parliament, most likely from the ranks of opposition lawmakers.",
      "Those who pick his successor will likely also have to find a platform that will satisfy the demands of the largely young and well-educated class that has led the protests. That could include moving ahead with a national sovereignty fund introduced recently to better help spread the wealth.",
      "In stepping down, Oyun-Erdene defended his integrity but said he had made the mistake of \u201cpaying insufficient attention to social and internal political matters.\u201d",
      "He also warned of political instability ahead, saying it \"could lead the public to lose faith in parliamentary rule and potentially put our democratic parliamentary system at risk of collapse.\u201d",
      "Erin Murphy, deputy director and senior fellow of India and emerging Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it's not easy to \"build that foundation for democracy\u201d at a time when Mongolia also must tackle economic problems.",
      "Julian Dierkes, a Mongolia expert at the University of Mannheim in Germany, said he doesn\u2019t expect any major policy changes, whoever becomes the next prime minister.",
      "\u201cThey will be selected on the basis of personal networks and patronage,\u201d Dierkes said.",
      "Many people on the street seemed worried for the future and some defended the outgoing prime minister on Tuesday.",
      "Oyun-Erdene should not be responsible for his son's failings, said Gansukh Batbayar, a military retiree in Ulaanbaatar who lauded what he described as Oyun-Erdene's efforts to \u201cconfiscate illegally earned assets and money of corrupt officials\u201d and distribute it more fairly.",
      "\u201cWe barely survive in these chaotic times and our pensions are very small,\u201d said an older woman on a public bus in Ulaanbaataar, who declined to give her name to speak about the political developments.",
      "She counts on her children \"to have food to eat and a roof over my head,\u201d she said.",

      "An Australian woman accused of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives with poisonous mushrooms has told a court she accepts the fatal lunch she served contained death caps",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- An Australian woman accused of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives with poisonous mushrooms told a court on Tuesday she accepted that the fatal lunch she served contained death caps.",
      "But Erin Patterson said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the fungi came from local stores. She denies three counts of murder and one of attempted murder over the beef Wellington meal she served to her parents-in-law and her estranged husband\u2019s aunt and uncle at her home in July 2023.",
      "Don Patterson, Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson were hospitalized and died after the lunch in the rural town of Leongatha in the Australian state of Victoria. Heather\u2019s husband, Ian Wilkinson, was gravely ill but survived.",
      "Patterson\u2019s lawyer earlier told the Supreme Court trial that the poisoning was a tragic accident but prosecutors said it was deliberate. If convicted, she faces a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder charges and 25 years in jail for attempted murder.",
      "Long queues formed outside the Latrobe Valley Courthouse on Tuesday after Patterson took the stand late Monday, which was the first time she had spoken publicly since the deaths.",
      "During several hours of evidence on Tuesday, Patterson, 50, told the court she began foraging fungi during the COVID-19 lockdown of March 2020, witnessed only by her children.",
      "\u201cI cut a bit of one of the mushrooms, fried it up with some butter and ate it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tasted good and I didn\u2019t get sick.\u201d",
      "Patterson said she also fed foraged mushrooms to her children, chopped up \u201cvery, very small\" so they couldn\u2019t pick them out of curries, pasta and soups.",
      "She developed a taste for exotic varieties, joined a \u201cmushroom lovers\u201d Facebook group, and bought a dehydrator to preserve her finds, Patterson said. Her lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, asked if she accepted that the beef Wellington pastries she had served to her lunch guests in 2023 contained death caps.",
      "\u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Patterson.",
      "The accused told her lawyer most of the mushrooms she used that day came from local supermarkets. She agreed she might have put them in the same container as dehydrated wild mushrooms she had foraged weeks earlier and others from an Asian food store.",
      "Mandy in April told the court his client had lied when she initially told investigators that she had never foraged before. But he denied that she had deliberately sought out death cap mushrooms and said she disposed of her dehydrator in a panic about the accidental deaths.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Patterson became tearful when she was asked about expletive-filled messages she had sent about her in-laws in December 2022 in a Facebook group chat that she described as a \u201csafe venting space\u201d for a group of women.",
      "\u201cI wish I\u2019d never said it. I feel very ashamed for saying it and I wish that the family didn\u2019t have to hear that I said it,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d",
      "Patterson, who said she had tried to have her parents-in-law mediate a dispute with her estranged husband, Simon, about school fees, said she was feeling hurt, frustrated and \u201ca little bit desperate.\u201d",
      "The couple formally separated in 2015 after earlier temporary splits, the court has heard. Simon Patterson was invited to the July 2023 lunch but did not attend.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s evidence also traversed Patterson\u2019s health after prosecutors' suggestions that her lunch invitation was unusual and that she'd organized it on a false pretense of receiving a cancer diagnosis. The mother of two admitted she never had cancer, but had been worried enough by symptoms to seek tests.",
      "Despite her separation from Simon, Patterson said she had hoped to reunite with her estranged husband and said she had remained close to her in-laws.",
      "\u201cIt never changed. I was just their daughter in law,\u201d said Patterson, through tears. \u201cThey just continued to love me.\u201d",
      "The 14-member jury has heard five weeks of prosecution evidence, including what the lunch guests told relatives before they died. Heather Wilkinson said shortly before she died that Patterson ate her individual beef wellington pastry from a different colored plate to the other diners, said prosecutor Nanette Rogers.",
      "Opening her case in April, Rogers said the poisoning was deliberate but that her case would not suggest a motive for the alleged killings. The prosecution says Patterson lied when she told investigators she had eaten the same meal as her guests and fed her children the leftovers.",
      "Patterson is due to continue giving evidence on Wednesday. Her evidence Tuesday did not include her account of the day of the lunch, or cross-examination from prosecutors.",

      "Pakistani officials say an inmate was killed and more than 100 escaped from a prison in the southern city of Karachi overnight after they were temporarily moved out of their cells following mild earthquake tremors",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- More than 100 inmates escaped from a prison and at least one was killed in a shootout in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi overnight after they were temporarily moved out of their cells following mild earthquake tremors, officials said Tuesday.",
      "Kashif Abbasi, a senior police official, said 216 inmates fled the prison in the capital of Sindh province before dawn. Of those, 78 had been recaptured. No one convicted or facing trial as a militant is among those who fled, he said.",

      "Ziaul Hassan, the home minister of Sindh province, said the jailbreak occurred after prisoners were evacuated from their cells for safety during the earthquake. The inmates were still outside of the cells when a group suddenly attacked guards, seized their weapons, opened fire and fled.",
      "Though prisoners have escaped while being transported to court for trial, prison beaks are not common in Pakistan, where authorities have enhanced security since 2013 when the Pakistani Taliban freed more than 200 inmates in an attack on a prison in the northwestern district of Dera Ismail Khan.",

      "Preliminary vote tallies from Mexico's first judicial elections indicate the ruling Morena party is headed toward control over the Supreme Court",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s ruling Morena party appeared to be heading toward control over the Supreme Court, preliminary vote tallies of the country's first judicial election indicated.",
      "While votes were still being counted for the majority of the 2,600 federal, state and local judge positions up for grabs in Sunday\u2019s judicial elections, results rolled in for the nine Supreme Court positions.",
      "The majority of the newly elected justices share strong ties and ideological alignments with the ruling party, shifting a once fairly balanced high court into the hands of the very party that overhauled the judicial system to elect judges for the first time.",
      "Experts warned the shift would undercut checks and balances in the Latin American nation: The governing party would now be close to controlling all three branches of government, and President Claudia Sheinbaum and her party also would have a easier path to push through their agenda.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re watching as power is falling almost entirely into the hands of one party,\u201d said Georgina De la Fuente, election specialist with the Mexican consulting firm Strategia Electoral. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any balance of power.\u201d",
      "Some of those headed toward election were members or former members of the party. A number of them, who were Supreme Court justices prior to the election, were appointed by former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum\u2019s mentor who pushed through the judicial overhaul last year.",
      "Others were advisers to the president or the party or campaigned with politically aligned visions for the judiciary.",
      "Not all of the prospective winners were explicitly aligned with Morena. One standout was Hugo Aguilar Ortiz, an Indigenous lawyer from the southern state of Oaxaca. He has no clear party affiliation, though Sheinbaum said repeatedly she hoped to have an Indigenous judge on the court.",
      "That Morena would emerge from the election with control of the judiciary was what critics had feared.",
      "The vote came after months of fierce debate, prompted when L\u00f3pez Obrador and the party jammed through the reforms for judges to be elected instead of being appointed based on merits. The overhaul will notably limit the Supreme Court as a counterweight to the president.",
      "Critics say the judicial reform was an attempt to take advantage of high popularity levels to stack courts in favor of the party. Sheinbaum and her mentor have insisted that electing judges will root out corruption in a system most Mexicans agree is broken.",
      "\u201cWhoever says that there is authoritarianism in Mexico is lying,\u201d Sheinbaum said during the vote. \u201cMexico is a country that is only becoming more free, just and democratic because that is the will of the people.\u201d",
      "The elections were marred by low participation \u2014 about 13% \u2014 and confusion by voters who struggled to understand the new voting system, something opponents quickly latched onto as a failure.",
      "De la Fuente said Morena is likely to use its new lack of counterweight in the high court to push through rounds of reforms, including electoral changes.",
      "Late Monday, more than 85% of the ballots had been tallied and counting was to continue overnight.",
      "\u2014 Hugo Aguilar Ortiz was the big surprise from the election. The Indigenous lawyer led all vote-getters, including several sitting Supreme Court justices. He\u2019s known as a legal activist fighting for the rights of Indigenous Mexicans and has criticized corruption in the judiciary.",
      "\u2014 Lenia Batres was already a Supreme Court justice and was appointed by L\u00f3pez Obrador. Previously a congresswoman, she\u2019s a member of Morena and clearly an ally of Mexico\u2019s president.",
      "\u2014 Yasm\u00edn Esquivel is a Supreme Court justice who was appointed by L\u00f3pez Obrador. She focused her campaign on modernizing the justice system and has pushed for gender equality. She was at the center of a 2022 controversy when she was accused of plagiarizing her thesis. She is considered an ally of the Morena party.",
      "\u2014 Loretta Ortiz is a justice on the Supreme Court who was appointed by L\u00f3pez Obrador. She also served in Congress and resigned from Morena in 2018 in a show of independence as a judge. Despite that, she\u2019s considered an ally of the party.",
      "\u2014 Mar\u00eda Estela R\u00edos Gonz\u00e1lez is a lawyer who acted as legal adviser to L\u00f3pez Obrador, first when he was mayor of Mexico City and later when he became president. She has a long history as a public servant and work in labor law and on a number of Indigenous issues.",
      "\u2014 Giovanni Figueroa Mej\u00eda is a lawyer from the Pacific coast state of Nayarit with a doctorate in constitutional law. He currently works as an academic at the Iberoamericana University in Mexico City. He\u2019s worked in human rights. While he holds no clear party affiliation, he supported the judicial overhaul pushed forward by Morena, saying in an interview with his university that the overhaul \u201cwas urgent and necessary in order to rebuild\u201d the judiciary. He said some of his work in constitutional law was cited in justifying the reform.",
      "\u2014 Irving Espinosa Betanzo is a magistrate on Mexico City\u2019s Supreme Court and has previously worked as a congressional adviser to Morena. He campaigned for the country's highest court on a platform of eliminating nepotism and corruption and pushing for human rights.",

      "Aid groups and opposition politicians in South Sudan say that dozens of civilians have been killed or badly injured in airstrikes in recent weeks as the country\u2019s army clashes with militia groups across the country",
      "AKOBO, South Sudan -- Wiyuach Makuach sat on her bed in a dimly lit ward of a hospital near South Sudan \u2019s border with Ethiopia and rested her remaining arm in her lap as she recalled the airstrike that took her other arm and nearly killed her.",
      "\u201cEverything was on fire,\u201d she said in an interview at the hospital in the border town of Akobo where she was being treated for her injuries.",
      "The bombing happened on May 3 at another hospital in the northern community of Fangak where she had traveled to be with her 25-year-old son while he sought treatment for tuberculosis. A series of strikes there, including several at the Doctors Without Borders facility, killed seven people.",
      "\u201cI ran outside and started rubbing mud on myself to stop the burning,\u201d Makuach said.",
      "Makuach, 60, is just one of the dozens of civilians who aid groups say have been killed or badly injured by airstrikes in recent weeks as South Sudan\u2019s army clashes with militia groups across the country. The army says it targets only combatants, and has not commented on civilian casualties.",
      "\u201cThe army displaced us and our families into the bush and that\u2019s when we decided we would fight back,\u201d said Gatkuoth Wie, 24, who was wounded while fighting in northern Jonglei State.",
      "The fighting has led to U.N. warnings that South Sudan is again on the brink of civil war. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to send to South Sudan a group of eight deportees from Cuba, Vietnam and elsewhere who have been convicted in the U.S. of serious crimes, sparking a legal fight that has reached the Supreme Court.",
      "Many of those wounded in the South Sudan clashes have been transported to Akobo, where the International Committee for the Red Cross has set up a temporary surgical response. Others have been stranded for days by the fighting.",
      "Doctor Bjarte Andersen, a surgeon working with the ICRC, says that the fighting has made it difficult to transport patients that have been critically wounded. \u201cWe know of one person who has died waiting for transportation, but there are probably more,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe most critical cases cannot even be moved, they are not likely to survive the journey,\u201d said Christina Bartulec, who oversees the organization\u2019s medical operation in Akobo.",
      "The ICRC does not track which patients are combatants and which are civilians. Most of the people brought to their facility are young men, several of whom told The Associated Press that they were engaged in fighting.",
      "In the past month, however, an increasing number of the victims have been women and a few children, according to hospital staff.",
      "One is Kuaynin Bol, 15, who was gravely injured by a blast as he lay asleep in his home. Surgeons have removed bone fragments from his brain and performed four operations on his leg, which was badly broken.",
      "Simmering tensions between the government and opposition groups erupted in March when a local militia called the White Army overran a military barracks in Nasir, a town in the country\u2019s northeast.",
      "The government pinned responsibility for the attack on First Vice President Riek Machar, placing him under house arrest and detaining other members of his SPLM-IO party. It also brought in Ugandan forces to support a sweeping military offensive against opposition troops and community militias across the country.",
      "That offensive centered on Upper Nile State and allegedly involved use of improvised incendiary weapons that Human Rights Watch has said killed at least 58 people, including children.",
      "In May, the fighting spread to northern Jonglei State where Fangak is located, a region previously unaffected by the violence, after the government alleged several barges were hijacked by opposition forces there.",
      "Isaac Pariel, a member of Machar's opposition party who is the local chairman in Fangak of the government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, said that at least 25 civilians have been killed this month. But the true toll is likely higher, as much of the fighting has taken place in remote areas that are inaccessible to medical workers.",
      "One bombardment in the village of Wichmon on May 15 killed 12 people including 8 children, according to local authorities and one eyewitness. The Associated Press was unable to independently verify those figures.",
      "The government has not officially claimed responsibility for the strikes.",
      "Army spokesman General Lul Ruai Koang told The Associated Press he was not authorized to comment on \u201congoing military operations across the country.\u201d",
      "The violence has been devastating for civilians already reeling from successive humanitarian crises.",
      "Much of the fighting has taken place in South Sudan\u2019s Greater Upper Nile region, a vast floodplain that in recent years has been ravaged by extreme weather, disease, and severe food insecurity.",
      "\u201cThe people here are moving all the time, just during the night,\u201d said William Nyuon, a Fangak resident. \u201cThey fear the plane will come and bomb them again.\u201d",

But the government faces a populist backlash against the shared currency on the eve of a key decision by European Union authorities.",
      "Fears of inflation, poverty and the unknown are mingling with disinformation spread on social media that aims to turn people against the euro. The discontent tracks with increased support for populist and anti-EU parties across Europe, which is exploited by nationalist and pro-Russian politicians in a country that remains one of Europe's poorest and most afflicted with corruption.",
      "\u201cAdopting the euro will make us feel the threshold of poverty. After all, prices will be in euros,\u201d said 78-year-old retiree Tanya Ignatova.",
      "\u201cBulgaria is not ready for the euro. Someday we may be ready, but not now,\" said another retiree, Mario Georgiev.",
      "Several thousand people rallied against the euro in the capital on Saturday, urging a referendum on whether to transition from the lev currency to the euro. The head of the pro-Russian Varazhdane party, Kostadin Kostadinov, told the crowd that \u201cBulgaria has risen and declared: Freedom, we choose the Bulgarian lev!\u201d",
      "Others in Bulgaria say the country already benefits from EU membership and it does not matter what the currency is. \"We have inflation now and we will have it in the future,\u201d said 26-year-old Konstantin Bozhinov.",
      "Aiming at deepening European integration amid growing geopolitical tensions, the government is pressing ahead. It has asked for a review of whether it meets the requirements of low inflation, sound government finances and legal conformity to EU institutions. On Wednesday, the European Commission will announce the results.",
      "If the commission gives a green light, other member states will decide on Bulgaria's candidacy in the coming weeks.",
      "At the last review in 2022, Bulgaria failed on the inflation requirement. Inflation has since fallen.",
      "President Rumen Radev has encouraged the anti-euro voices by proposing a referendum on the currency, citing public concerns over inflation and purchasing power. That followed a protest in February that saw the offices of the EU's executive commission in Sofia spattered with red paint and its entrance set on fire.",
      "The president's proposal was turned down by the pro-European majority in parliament, which accused Radev of acting in favor of Russia with his last-minute attempt to sabotage the euro adoption.",
      "According to the EU\u2019s multi-country Eurobarometer survey released last week, 50% of Bulgarians are against the adoption of the euro, while 43% are in favor. In contrast, trust in the euro continues to grow across the rest of the EU.",
      "Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. It has been plagued by political instability and corruption that have fueled euroscepticism among its 6.4 million citizens. Analysts say disinformation campaigns from abroad have fed fears of economic changes that could bring more poverty.",
      "Scores of false claims by opponents of the eurozone have been published on social networks. One claim says the EU plans to take away people\u2019s savings if they fail to spend them within a certain period. Another claims that plans to introduce a digital version of the euro are part of a plan to control everyone.",
      "\u201cThere is a powerful brainwashing of the average Bulgarian. Illusory fears are being spread, lies are being told wholesale, unscrupulously and brazenly,\" said Ognyan Minchev, director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies in Sofia.",
      "Economists say joining the euro will not bring massive change to Bulgaria's economy in the short run. That's because the government has pegged the currency to the euro by law, at a fixed rate of 1 lev for every 51 euro cents.",
      "Joining the euro can bring lower borrowing costs, greater ease in comparing domestic and foreign prices and no need to exchange money when vacationing in another euro country. More than that, it\u2019s a sign of integration into the EU and its large economy. Members get a seat on the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate-setting committee.",
      "Countries agree to join the euro when they join the EU, but so far 20 of 27 members have taken the step. Croatia was the last to join in 2023.",
      "Bulgaria's government has very little debt, at 24.1% of GDP \u2014 the second lowest in the EU and well below the 60% level in euro membership criteria. That's a sharp contrast to its neighbor, Greece, which entered the euro in 1999 with high debt that was concealed through complex financial transactions. Greece's broken finances eventually triggered a eurozone-wide crisis.",
      "Bulgaria's government has been \u201cfiscally super conservative ... the risk of Bulgaria becoming a fiscal risk to the eurozone is essentially zero,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.",
      "Fears of inflation are not entirely without basis. Experience in other countries shows that \u201cwhenever there is a changeover from national currency to the euro, there is often a minor inflation effect, but it's typically less than 1%,\u201d said Darvas",
      "Economists say a one-time increase occurs as service providers such as restaurants, which don't adjust prices as often as other sectors, take advantage of re-doing menus and price lists to implement hikes.",

      "No major damage was reported.",
      "The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency said the quake hit at 2:17 a.m. and was centered in the Mediterranean Sea, off the holiday resort of Marmaris. It was felt in neighboring regions, including on the Greek island of Rhodes, waking many from their sleep.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Activists on Monday celebrated a decision by Puerto Rico\u2019s Supreme Court to allow nonbinary and gender-nonconforming people to update their birth certificates.",
      "The ruling comes after a group of six nonbinary people filed a lawsuit against Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, its health secretary and other officials.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Millions of South Koreans are voting Tuesday for a new president in a snap election triggered by the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative who now faces an explosive trial on rebellion charges over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Pre-election surveys suggested Yoon\u2019s liberal archrival, Lee Jae-myung, appeared headed for an easy win, riding on deep public frustration over the conservatives in the wake of Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle.",
      "The main conservative candidate, Kim Moon Soo, has struggled to win over moderate, swing voters as his People Power Party remains in a quagmire of internal feuding over how to view Yoon\u2019s actions.",
      "This election serves as another defining moment in the country\u2019s resilient democracy, but observers worry a domestic divide worsened after Yoon's martial law stunt is far from over and could pose a big political burden on the new president.",
      "The past six months saw large crowds of people rallying in the streets to either denounce or support Yoon, while a leadership vacuum caused by Yoon\u2019s impeachment and ensuing formal dismissal rattled the country\u2019s high-level diplomatic activities and financial markets.",
      "The winning candidate will immediately be sworn in as president Wednesday for a single, full term of five years without the typical two-month transition period. The new president will face major challenges including a slowing economy, President Donald Trump\u2019s America-first policies and North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear threats.",
      "Voting began at 6 a.m. at 14,295 polling stations nationwide that will close at 8 p.m. Observers say the winner could emerge as early as midnight.",
      "As of 2 p.m., more than 13 million people had cast their ballots. Combined with the 15 million who voted during last week\u2019s two-day early voting period, voter turnout stood at 65.5%. South Korea has 44.4 million eligible voters.",
      "In a Facebook posting on Tuesday, Lee, whose Democratic Party led the legislative effort to oust Yoon, called for voters to \u201cdeliver a stern and resolute judgement\u201d against the conservatives over martial law.",
      "In one of his final campaign speeches Monday, Lee argued that a win by Kim would mean the \u201cthe return of the rebellion forces, the destruction of democracy and the deprival of people\u2019s human rights.\u201d He also promised to revitalize the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions. He urged the people to vote for him,",
      "Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, warned that a Lee win would allow him to wield excessive power, launch political retaliation against opponents and legislate laws to protect him from various legal troubles, as his party already controls parliament.",
      "Lee \u201cis now trying to seize all power in South Korea and establish a Hitler-like dictatorship,\u201d Kim told a rally in the southeastern city of Busan.",
      "Lee, who served as governor of Gyeonggi province and mayor of Seongnam city, has been a highly divisive figure in South Korean politics for years.",
      "As a former child laborer known for his inspirational rags-to-riches story, Lee came to fame through biting criticism of the country\u2019s conservative establishment and calls to build a more assertive South Korea in foreign policy. That rhetoric has given him an image as someone who can institute sweeping reforms and fix the country\u2019s deep-seated economic inequality and corruption.",
      "His critics view him as a dangerous populist who relies on a political division and backpedals on promises too easily.",
      "On foreign policy, Lee has not made any contentious remarks recently and has steadfastly vowed to pursue pragmatic diplomacy. He has called South Korea\u2019s alliance with the U.S. the foundation of its foreign policy and promised to solidify a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo partnership, a stance that is not much different than the position held by South Korea\u2019s conservatives.",
      "Experts say there aren\u2019t many diplomatic options for South Korea as it tries to address Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and calls for South Korea to pay more for the cost of the U.S. military presence, as well as North Korea\u2019s headlong pursuit of nuclear weapons. Experts say that has made both Lee and Kim avoid unveiling ambitious foreign policy goals.",
      "Lee\u2019s government still could become engaged in \u201ca little bit of friction\u201d with the Trump administration, while Kim\u2019s government, which prioritize relations with Washington, will likely offer more concessions to the U.S., said Chung Jin-young, a former dean of the Graduate School of Pan-Pacific International Studies at South Korea\u2019s Kyung Hee University.",
      "Chung predicted Lee won\u2019t be able to pursue overly drastic steps on foreign policy and security, given the country\u2019s foreign exchange and financial markets are very vulnerable to such changes.",
      "Lee has preached patience over Trump\u2019s tariff policy, arguing it would be a mistake to rush negotiations in pursuit of an early agreement with Washington. Kim has said he would meet Trump as soon as possible.",
      "On Monday, South Korean trade officials held an emergency meeting to discuss a response to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will raise tariffs on steel and aluminum products to 50% beginning June 4. South Korea\u2019s central bank last week sharply lowered its 2025 growth outlook to 0.8%, citing the potential impact of Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and weak domestic demand worsened by the political turmoil of past months.",
      "Relations with North Korea remain badly strained since 2019, with the North focused on expanding its nuclear arsenal while refusing dialogues with South Korea and the U.S.",
      "Since his second term began in January, Trump has repeatedly expressed his intent to resume diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but Kim has so far ignored the offer while making Russia his priority in foreign policy.",
      "Lee, who wants warmer ties with North Korea, recently acknowledged it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to realize a summit with Kim Jong Un anytime soon. Lee said he would support Trump\u2019s push to restart talks with Kim Jong Un, which he believed would eventually allow South Korea to be involved in some projects in North Korea.",
      "Foreign policy strategists for Lee understand there isn\u2019t much South Korea can do to bring about a denuclearization of North Korea, said Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University.",
      "He said Lee also doesn\u2019t share the Korean nationalistic zeal held by ex-liberal President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim Jong Un three times during his 2017-22 term.",

      "Top Trump administration officials on Tuesday headlined an energy conference led by the state\u2019s Republican governor",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Top Trump administration officials \u2014 fresh off touring one of the country's largest oil fields in the Alaska Arctic \u2014 headlined an energy conference led by the state's Republican governor on Tuesday that environmentalists criticized as promoting new oil and gas drilling and turning away from the climate crisis.",
      "Several dozen protesters were outside Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage, where U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin were featured speakers. The federal officials were continuing a multiday trip aimed at highlighting President Donald Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The trip has included meetings with pro-drilling groups and officials, including some Alaska Native leaders on the petroleum-rich North Slope, and a visit to the Prudhoe Bay oil field near the Arctic Ocean that featured selfies near the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline.",
      "Calls for additional oil and gas drilling \u2014 including Trump\u2019s renewed focus on getting a massive liquefied natural gas project built \u2014 are \u201cfalse solutions\u201d to energy needs and climate concerns, protester Sarah Furman said outside the Anchorage convention hall, as people carried signs with slogans such as \u201cAlaska is Not for Sale\u201d and \u201cProtect our Public Lands.\u201d",
      "\"We find it really disingenuous that they\u2019re hosting this conference and not talking about real solutions,\u201d she said.",
      "Topics at the conference, which runs through Thursday, also include mining, carbon management, nuclear energy, renewables and hydrogen. Oil has been Alaska\u2019s economic lifeblood for decades, and Dunleavy has continued to embrace fossil fuels even as he has touted other energy opportunities in the state.",
      "Another protester, Rochelle Adams, who is Gwich\u2019in, raised concerns about the ongoing push to allow oil and gas drilling on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Gwich\u2019in leaders have said they consider the coastal plain sacred, as caribou they rely on calve there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling as economically vital and have joined Alaska political leaders in welcoming Trump's interest in reviving a leasing program there.",
      "\u201cWhen these people come from outside to take and take and take, we are going to be left with the aftereffects,\u201d Adams said, adding later: \u201cIt's our health that will be impacted. It\u2019s our wellness, our ways of life.\u201d",
      "Zeldin, during a friendly question-and-answer period led by Dunleavy, said wildlife he saw while on the North Slope didn't appear \u201cto be victims of their surroundings\u201d and seemed \u201chappy.\u201d",
      "Burgum, addressing a move toward additional drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, said wildlife and development can coexist. His agency during the Alaska trip announced plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in portions of the petroleum preserve that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.",
      "Wright bristled at the idea of policy \"in the name of climate change\u201d that he said would have no impact on climate change. Stopping oil production in Alaska doesn't change demand for oil, he said.",
      "\u201cYou know, we hear terms like clean energy and renewable energy. These are inaccurate marketing terms,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no energy source that does not take significant materials, land and impact on the environment to produce. Zero.\u201d",
      "Joining for part of the U.S. officials' trip were representatives from Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and United Arab Emirates. Asian countries are being courted to sign onto the Alaska gas project, which has floundered for years to gain traction amid cost and other concerns. The project, as proposed, would include a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from the North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports of liquefied natural gas.",
      "Wright told reporters a goal in inviting them to the Prudhoe Bay stop was for them to see the oil pipeline infrastructure and environment and meet with residents and business leaders.",
      "Glenfarne Alaska LNG LLC, which has taken a lead in advancing the project, on Tuesday announced expressions of interest from a number of \u201cpotential partners.\" Costs surrounding the project \u2014 which have been pegged around $44 billion for the pipeline and other infrastructure \u2014 are in the process of being refined before a decision is made on whether to move forward.",

      "The life of South Korea's new President Lee Jae-myung is full of ups and downs",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Lee Jae-myung was a child laborer with an arm deformity. He attempted suicide. He later made his way through university and became a highly divisive politician who survived a stabbing attack and struggles with numerous criminal charges.",
      "His turbulent life climaxed, as Lee, 60, the candidate of the main liberal Democratic Party, was elected as South Korea's new president to succeed his conservative archrival Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted over his stunning imposition of martial law.",
      "There are both hopes and fears about Lee's win. Supporters think he's an able leader who can get things done and fix the country's deep-rooted economic inequality and corruption. But critics say Lee will likely oppress political opponents and intensify a domestic division.",
      "Here's a look at Lee, whose single, five-year presidency begins on Wednesday:",
      "After graduating from an elementary school, Lee had to work at various factories in Seongnam, a city near Seoul, because his family couldn\u2019t afford his secondary education.",
      "At a factory manufacturing baseball gloves, he had his left forearm crushed by a press machine, getting a permanent arm disability. Lee said he suffered beating at his factories and hated encountering a girl who was a neighbor when he helped his garbage collector father's work at a traditional market.",
      "Despaired, Lee tried to kill himself twice, both unsuccessfully. He later got back on his feet and entered Seoul's Chung-Ang University with a full scholarship, before he became a human rights lawyer.",
      "\u201cHopes and ordeals always come together. The roles of ordeals are not getting people to surrender, but testing how serious and desperate their hopes are,\u201d Lee said in a memoir published in 2017.",
      "Lee later entered politics and became Seongnam mayor and governor of Gyeonggi province. Once a political outsider, Lee rose to prominence in 2016 after he made a series of fiery street speeches criticizing then conservative President Park Geun-hye, who was later removed from office over a corruption scandal.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s seize her with our hands and consign her to history,\" Lee said during one rally in December 2016.",
      "Many of his comments have since sharply polarized South Koreans.",
      "Lee vilified South Korea's conservative establishment as greedy \u201cfake conservatives.\" He slammed a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea as a source of tensions and likened strengthening U.S.-Japan ties to a 1905 Washington-Tokyo agreement that he said helped Japan colonize the Korean Peninsula later.",
      "Lee's proposal of giving a universal basic income to all citizens have invited accusations that he's a populist.",
      "In 2022, he lost the hotly contested presidential election to Yoon. In 2024, Lee was attacked by a man who told investigators that he wanted to kill Lee to prevent him from becoming president.",
      "Recently, Lee has made few contentious or radical comments on foreign policy and security issues, and rather has promised to pursue pragmatic diplomacy.",
      "He's repeatedly described South Korea's alliance with the U.S. as the foundation of the country's foreign policy and stressed the need to maintain a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to what Lee said in the past, we don't know whether he made such comments only to appeal to his supporters or whether they showed his true nature,\u201d said Shin Yul, a politics professor at Seoul\u2019s Myonggi University.",
      "The major issues that Lee will immediately face is U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and other \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, and North Korea's advancing nuclear program. They are both vital issues for South Korea, but many experts say there isn't much diplomatic room for South Korea to maneuver in to produce major changes in its favor in both matters.",
      "Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University, said that Trump is \u201ctoo overwhelming and dominant,\u201d so that whoever is in South Korean leadership, the country's dealings with the U.S. won't be much different. He said that foreign policy advisers for Lee would also know that North Korea won't voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons.",
      "Lee comes to office under the shadow of his own legal troubles.",
      "He stands accused in five trials over corruption and other charges, and at one point, some of his legal battles threatened his bid for presidency.",
      "Lee celebrated in March when the Seoul High Court overturned a suspended prison sentence against him for violating the election law during the 2022 race. But he fumed in May when the Supreme Court quashed that ruling and sent the case back to the high court, citing a strong likelihood of his guilt. Hearings at the high court were eventually postponed until after the election.",
      "Had his conviction been finalized, Lee would have been barred from running for president.",
      "Other trials center around his roles in dubious development projects and illegal money transfers to North Korea, and his alleged misuse of official funds and persuading of a witness to commit perjury.",
      "Lee's five trials will likely stop as South Korea\u2019s constitution prevents a sitting president from being charged with most crimes. But his rivals will take issue with it, because the constitution doesn't clearly state whether a president can be convicted for crimes in which indictments came before taking up office.",
      "Lee\u2019s Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the National Assembly, has been pushing to revise the criminal procedure law to suspend ongoing criminal trials involving a sitting president until the end of their term. Conservatives have harshly lambasted the move.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Lee vowed not to pursue a vendetta against conservatives. However, he has also called for a thorough investigation into Yoon and his inner circle over rebellion allegations.",
      "Lee's opponents worry he could use those investigations to clamp down on Yoon associates and prosecutors who he thinks orchestrated inquiries involving his criminal charges.",
      "Yoon's martial law stunt intensified a domestic divide.",
      "Declaring martial law, Yoon portrayed Lee's party as \u201canti-state\u201d forces influenced by North Korea and China. He has also endorsed baseless election fraud theories to discredit the liberals\u2019 legislative majority, prompting his angry supporters to pour onto the streets with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d signs. Anti-Yoon activists and citizens, for their part, also rallied for weeks to demand his immediate dismissal.",
      "With liberals remaining in control of the legislature, Lee faces a far more favorable environment to advance his policies. Conservatives have voiced concern that Lee and the Democratic Party will wield virtually unchecked power to pass legislation previously blocked by Yoon\u2019s administration, including bills aimed at strengthening protections for labor unionists against corporate lawsuits and shielding farmers from volatile rice prices.",

    "story": [
      "Colombia\u2019s wind energy plans in La Guajira are faltering as major companies exit and projects remain stalled",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia\u2019s ambitious plans for wind energy development, especially in the resource-rich La Guajira region, are facing serious setbacks as major companies pull out and projects stall, industry experts say.",
      "Margarita Nieves, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, told The Associated Press that despite large targets \u2014 including 1.1 gigawatts awarded in a 2019 auction \u2014 only two wind farms are partially operating today, with a combined capacity of less than 32 megawatts.",
      "Colombia\u2019s Mining and Energy Planning Unit estimates the country could generate up to 18 gigawatts of wind energy \u2014 nearly double the nation\u2019s current installed electricity capacity of 20 gigawatts.",
      "Several companies brought equipment and infrastructure to Colombia around 2021 before securing permits, but parks remain unbuilt. Key obstacles include limited grid connection infrastructure in La Guajira, recent regulatory changes that reduce financial returns and complex social and leadership challenges.",
      "Colombia, Latin America\u2019s third-most populous country, has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. President Gustavo Petro, the country\u2019s first leftist leader, presents himself as an environmentalist and advocate of a just energy transition. Yet Colombia remains deeply reliant on fossil fuels \u2014 oil is its top export and a major source of government revenue.",
      "In 2023, Italian multinational Enel withdrew from the Windpeshi onshore wind energy project in La Guajira. By late 2024, EDP Renewables canceled two major projects, Alpha and Beta, two large-scale onshore wind farms in the same region. In May, Colombian state-owned oil company Ecopetrol acquired nine solar and wind energy projects from Norway\u2019s Statkraft, marking the European firm\u2019s exit from the country. The portfolio spans La Guajira, Sucre, Cordoba, Caldas, and Magdalena, with a combined potential capacity of 1.3 gigawatts. Only one project is currently operational, with others expected to come online between 2026 and 2027.",
      "The move is part of Ecopetrol\u2019s broader energy transition strategy to reduce reliance on oil and gas and meet net-zero goals by 2050. However, challenges like regulatory delays, governance concerns, and potential impacts on Colombia\u2019s fiscal stability raise questions about the transition\u2019s pace and economic effects.",
      "Nieves warned that the situation is \u201cvery concerning,\u201d with only two of over 20 planned projects advancing. She stressed the need to speed up regulatory processes, improve consultations with Indigenous communities \u2014 notably the Wayuu in La Guajira \u2014 and ensure sufficient electrical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cColombia has more than 20 years of delay in wind energy,\u201d Nieves said. \u201cBrazil, in contrast, has built over 1,300 onshore wind farms in the last two decades and is a top global turbine producer.\"",
      "The wind energy projects were part of Colombia\u2019s just energy transition, aiming to replace fossil fuels with renewables while supporting vulnerable groups like Indigenous peoples. The region is home to Cerrejon, one of the largest open-pit coal mines in the world and a major player in Latin America\u2019s mining sector, which has been in operation since 1985. The mine has just nine years left in its life span, and its closure, without alternative plans in place, will deal a significant blow to the region\u2019s economy.",
      "For Samuel Lanao, head of La Guajira\u2019s environmental authority, the main reason several licensed renewable energy projects are being sold off is because companies struggle with deep-rooted social tensions, particularly during the prior consultation process with local Indigenous communities. Lanao said confrontations have emerged between firms and residents, derailing expectations of development.",
      "\u201cThis has been a major blow to La Guajira,\u201d he said, \u201cas there were high hopes for economic and social progress through these projects.\u201d",
      "The Wayuu people, a seminomadic Indigenous group in the arid La Guajira region of northern Colombia and Venezuela, remain divided over wind energy development. While some have welcomed the economic support offered by companies building turbines on their ancestral lands, many others have raised concerns over environmental and cultural impacts, and a lack of meaningful prior consultation, in what is one of Colombia\u2019s poorest regions.",
      "Diego Patron, manager of the Jemeiwaa Ka\u2019I wind project, a large-scale wind farm cluster in La Guajira, acknowledged the pioneering nature of Colombia\u2019s early wind efforts, which began in a regulatory vacuum without clear institutional frameworks.",
      "\u201cThese foundational projects faced a steep institutional and territorial learning curve, resulting in the loss of key strategic projects,\u201d Patron said. \u201cHowever, their legacy now forms the cornerstone for new initiatives.\"",
      "Patron believes that barriers around legitimate Wayuu community representation, environmental permitting, and contract resolutions have been overcome, creating more stable conditions.\u201d",
      "Patron said misinformation deepened tensions and unfairly damaged firms like EDP that, he says, aimed to support communities.",

      "Trump met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune at the White House early this week and has been dialing senators for one-on-one chats, using both the carrot and stick to nudge, badger and encourage them to act. But it's still a long road ahead for the 1,000-page-plus package.",
      "\u201cHis question to me was, How do you think the bill's going to go in the Senate?\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said about his call with Trump. \u201cDo you think there's going to be problems?\u201d",
      "It's a potentially tumultuous three-week sprint for senators preparing to put their own imprint on the massive Republican package that cleared the House late last month by a single vote. The senators have been meeting for weeks behind closed doors, including as they returned to Washington late Monday, to revise the package ahead of what is expected to be a similarly narrow vote in the Senate.",
      "\u201cPassing THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL is a Historic Opportunity to turn our Country around,\u201d Trump posted on social media. He urged them Monday \u201cto work as fast as they can to get this Bill to MY DESK before the Fourth of JULY.\u201d",
      "But Trump's high-octane ally, billionaire Elon Musk, lambasted the package \u2014 and those voting for it.",
      "\u201cThis massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk posted on his site X, as some lawmakers have expressed reservations about the details. \u201cShame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\u201d",
      "Thune, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, has few votes to spare from the Senate's slim, 53-seat GOP majority. Democrats are waging an all-out political assault on GOP proposals to cut Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments to help pay for more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts \u2014 with many lawmakers being hammered at boisterous town halls back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if we could have everybody on board to do it, but, you know, individual members are going to stake out their positions,\u201d Thune said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cBut in the end, we have to succeed. Failure\u2019s not an option.\u201d",
      "At its core, the package seeks to extend the tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump's first term at the White House, and add new ones the presidents campaigned on, including no taxes on tips and others. It also includes a massive build-up of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security.",
      "To defray the lost tax revenue to the government and avoid piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services. Estimates are 8.6 million people would no longer have health care and nearly 4 million would lose Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits, known as SNAP.",
      "The package also would raise the nation's debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the bills.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump's bill \"is ugly to its very core.\u201d",
      "Schumer said Tuesday it's a \u201clie\u201d that the cuts won't hurt Americans. \u201cBehind the smoke and mirrors lies a cruel and draconian truth: tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy paid for by gutting health care for millions of Americans,\" said the New York senator.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to soon provide an overall analysis of the package's impacts on the government balance sheets, particular rising annual deficits. But Republicans are ready to blast those findings from the congressional scorekeeper as flawed.",
      "Trump Tuesday switched to tougher tactics, deriding the holdout Republican senators to get on board.",
      "The president laid into Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian-leaning deficit hawk who has made a career of arguing against government spending. Paul wants the package's $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling out of the bill.",
      "\u201cRand votes NO on everything, but never has any practical or constructive ideas. His ideas are actually crazy (losers!).\u201d Trump posted.",
      "Paul seemed unfazed. \u201cI like the president, supported the president,\u201d the senator said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t in good conscience give up every principle that I stand for and every principle that I was elected upon.\u201d",
      "The July 4th deadline is not only aspirational for the president, it's all but mandatory for his Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned Congress that the nation will run out of money to pay its bills if the debt ceiling, now at $36 trillion, is not lifted by mid-July or early August to allow more borrowing. Bessent has also been meeting behind closed doors with senators and GOP leadership.",
      "Thune acknowledged Tuesday that lifting the debt ceiling is not up for debate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got to be done,\u201d the South Dakota senator said.",
      "The road ahead is also a test for Thune who, like Johnson, is a newer leader in Congress and among the many Republicans adjusting their own priorities with Trump's return to the White House.",
      "While Johnson has warned against massive changes to the package, Thune faces demands from his senators for adjustments.",
      "To make most of the tax cuts permanent \u2014 particularly the business tax breaks that are the Senate priorities \u2014 senators may shave some of Trump's proposed new tax breaks on automobile loans or overtime pay, which are policies less prized by some senators.",
      "There are also discussions about altering the $40,000 cap that the House proposed for state and local deductions, known as SALT, which are important to lawmakers in high-tax New York, California and other states, but less so among GOP senators.",
      "\u201cWe're having all those discussions,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., another key voice in the debate.",
      "Hawley is a among a group of senators, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who have raised concerns about the Medicaid changes that could boot people from health insurance.",
      "A potential copay of up to $35 for Medicaid services that was part of the House package, as well as a termination of a provider tax that many states rely on to help fund rural hospitals, have also raised concerns.",
      "\u201cThe best way to not be accused of cutting Medicaid is to not cut Medicaid,\u201d Hawley said.",
      "Collins said she is reviewing the details.",
      "There's also a House provision that would allow the auction of spectrum bandwidth that some senators oppose.",

      "A Spanish government minister tells The Associated Press that Spain has sent a message with its recent crackdown on Airbnb",
      "MADRID -- MADRID (AP) \u2014 Spain 's government wanted to send a message last month with its crackdown on Airbnb: that the Spanish economy and its housing market are not a \u201cfree for all\" that value profits over the rule of law, a minister told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "The government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules by failing to list license numbers, listing the wrong license number or not specifying the apartment's owner. Airbnb is appealing the move.",
      "Spain is one of the world\u2019s most visited countries. Last year, the Southern European nation of 49 million received a record 94 million international visitors.",
      "But a housing affordability problem that is particularly acute in cities such as Madrid and Barcelona has led to growing antagonism against short-term holiday rentals. Airbnb is perhaps the best-known and most visible actor.",
      "The Spanish government says the two are related: the rise of Airbnb and other short-term rental companies, and rising rents and housing costs.",
      "\u201cObviously there is a correlation between these two facts,\u201d Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s not a linear relation, it\u2019s not the only factor affecting it, there are many others, but it is obviously one of the elements that is contributing.\u201d",
      "A recent Bank of Spain report said the country has a shortfall of 450,000 homes. In the tourist hot spots of the Canary and Balearic Islands, half the housing stock is tourist accommodations or properties owned by nonresidents, the report said.",
      "\u201cTourism is for sure a vital part of the Spanish economy. It\u2019s a strategic and very important sector. But as in every other economic activity, it must be conducted in a sustainable way,\" Bustinduy said. \u201cIt cannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people. Their right to housing, but also their right to well-being.\u201d",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Homemade signs including one that read \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d at a recent march in Madrid point to the growing anger.",
      "\u201cA balance must be found between the constitutional rights of the Spanish people and economic activities in general,\" Bustinduy said.",
      "Regional governments in Spain are also tackling the issue. Last year, Barcelona announced a plan to close down all of the 10,000 apartments licensed in the city as short-term rentals by 2028 to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents.",
      "Airbnb said that while its appeal goes through the courts, no holiday rentals would be immediately taken down from the site.",
      "In response to Spain's order, Airbnb has said the platform connects property owners with renters but it doesn't have oversight obligations, even though it requires hosts to show that they are compliant with local laws.",
      "Bustinduy said Spain's recent action reflects a desire in Spain, but also elsewhere, to hold tech companies like Airbnb to account.",
      "\u201cThere is a battle going on about accountability and about responsibility,\u201d Bustinduy said. \u201cThe digital nature of these extraordinarily powerful multinational corporations must not be an excuse to fail to comply with democratically established regulations.\u201d",
      "Bustinduy, who belongs to the governing coalition's left-wing Sumar party, dismissed the idea that the Spanish government's action toward Airbnb could discourage some tourists from visiting.",
      "\u201cIt will encourage longer stays, it will encourage responsible tourism and it will preserve everything that we have in this wonderful country which is the reason why so many people want to come here,\" he said.",
      "The minister also took a shot at low-cost airlines. Spain has pushed against allowing such airlines to charge passengers for hand baggage. Last year, it fined five budget airlines, including RyanAir and easyJet, a total of $179 million for charging for hand luggage.",
      "\u201cThe principle behind these actions is always the same: preserving consumer rights,\u201d Bustinduy said. \u201cPowerful corporations, no matter how large, have to adapt their business models to existing regulations.\u201d",

      "Goodyear began experimenting with vessels that would be lighter than aircraft in the early 1900s, and the dirigibles have since become a lasting and iconic symbol of the corporate brand. For some, it evokes nostalgia, while for others it offers a glimpse into a larger-than-life part of advertisement history.",
      "Here is a by-the-numbers look at Goodyear airships over time:",
      "Goodyear establishes an Aeronautics Department to build lighter-than-air aircrafts, and by 1912 the company had built its first balloon.",
      "In 1930, the \u201cDefender\u201d blimp became the first airship in the world to carry a lit neon sign so the company\u2019s name could be seen after dark.",
      "Goodyear began making airships for the U.S. Navy in 1917, and its first blimp \u2014 the first commercial non-rigid airship flown using helium \u2014 launched years later, becoming a marketing tool.",
      "From 1942 to 1944, the company built more than 150 airships for the Navy to serve in World War II, flying patrol over warships on the seas with zero reported loss of ships when a blimp was on watch.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform.",
      "Since that time, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology; safety innovations; high-definition cameras; aerial views captured with specialized systems that compensate for movement during filming, resulting in stable and smooth footage footage; and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "There currently are four Goodyear Blimps \u2014 the three in the U.S. and one in Friedrichshafen, Germany.",
      "Today\u2019s Goodyear Blimps are semi-rigid dirigibles, meaning they have an internal frame as compared to previous eras of blimps that could be fully deflated. In 2014, Goodyear transitioned to the New Technology semi-rigid airship platform designed to allow for improved maneuverability and speed.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp is 246 feet long (75 meters), which would cover about 80% of a football field. It is 58 feet (18 meters) high and holds three Olympic-sized swimming pools' worth of helium.",
      "Goodyear gets helium for its blimps from multiple sources. Because helium is a finite resource, the company purifies its helium every six to eight weeks to extend its life.",
      "The blimp travels more than 100 days per year, with trips ranging anywhere from three days to three weeks. A crew of nearly 20 people travel with the airship whenever it is touring. Today\u2019s Goodyear Blimps fly between 1,000 and 1,500 feet (305 meters and 457 meters) in the air and travel at speeds up to 73 miles per hour (117 kilometers per hour).",
      "There currently are fewer blimp pilots in the world than astronauts, according to Goodyear, which has 10 full-time pilots. To serve in that job, you must have a commercial pilot license followed by approximately 250 hours of training to earn an additional lighter-than-air airship rating from the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, but it was rapper Ice Cube who raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",

      "Traditionally, the legacy media does not want its journalists expressing opinions about people they cover, since it calls into doubt their ability to report without bias. But exceptions are often made in cases where media access is at issue, said Tom Rosenstiel, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
      "The New York Times, for example, institutionally called upon Joe Biden to meet more often with journalists when he was president. The Pentagon Press Association said Hegseth\u2019s restrictions were a direct assault on the freedom of the press.",
      "One America News Network makes no secret of its allegiance to Trump. When Matt Gaetz's nomination as Trump's attorney general fell apart following the election, OAN quickly signed him up as a contributor. OAN faced lawsuits \u2014 and negotiated settlements \u2014 for its promotion of Trump's false theories that he did not lose the 2020 election.",
      "When Hegseth earlier this year evicted several news organizations from their Pentagon workspaces and gave more room to friendly outlets, Cuccia was assigned space formerly held by NBC News. Before Hegseth aide Sean Parnell's only media briefing, Cuccia said Hegseth's team reached out to her in advance to find out what questions she wanted to ask, something that would never be done for most media outlets.",
      "If OAN is responsible for removing Cuccia, it's a \u201ctake no quarter position,\u201d Rosenstiel said. \u201cThere is no room, if you're on the team, to say anything that is negative.\u201d",
      "He said he'd be interested to see if any representatives from pro-Trump media outlets defend her. \u201cAre they silent, or do they rally to her in any way?\u201d he asked. Trump, in the past, has frequently criticized Fox News Channel for saying anything on the air that he deemed negative.",
      "Part of Cuccia's Substack post sounded almost prescient about what might happen to her, when she reminisced about the energy of the early Make America Great Again movement. Questioning government then, she noted, was a point of pride.",
      "\u201cSomewhere along the way, we as a collective decided \u2014 if anyone ever questioned a policy or person within the MAGA movement \u2014 that they weren't MAGA enough,\" she wrote. \"That they were deep state, that they couldn't be trusted, that they didn't love America as much as we do and that ... to put it bluntly, they sucked.\u201d",

    "summary": "Liberal opposition candidate Lee Jae-myung has been elected president of South Korea",
    "story": [
      "Liberal opposition candidate Lee Jae-myung has been elected president of South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Lee Jae-myung, who rose from childhood poverty to become South Korea\u2019s leading liberal politician vowing to fight inequality and corruption, will become the country's next president on Wednesday after an election that closed one of the most turbulent chapters in the young democracy.",
      "Lee, 60, the candidate of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, is taking office for a full, single five-year term, succeeding Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative who was felled over his stunning yet brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "It was unclear whether Lee\u2019s election would cause any major, immediate shift in South Korea\u2019s foreign policy. Lee, previously accused by critics of tilting toward China and North Korea and away from the U.S. and Japan, has repeatedly stressed South Korea's alliance with the U.S. as the foundation of its foreign policy.",
      "The toughest external challenges awaiting Lee are U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy and North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program. But experts earlier said whoever becomes president can't do much to secure major progress in South Korea\u2019s favor on those issues.",
      "As of 3:45 a.m. Wednesday, with over 99% of the votes counted, Lee obtained 49.3% of the votes cast in Tuesday's early election, while main conservative contender Kim Moon Soo trailed with 41.3% \u2014 a gap that was impossible to overcome mathematically.",
      "Preelection surveys have long suggested Lee appeared headed for an easy win, riding on deep public frustration over the conservatives in the wake of Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle.",
      "Even before Lee\u2019s win was formally declared, Kim conceded, telling journalists that he \u201chumbly accepts the people\u2019s choice,\u201d and congratulated Lee.",
      "Earlier, Lee appeared before thousands of cheering supporters on Seoul's streets. He didn't formally claim victory, but reiterated his major policy goals, such as revitalizing the economy, promoting peace with North Korea and easing a domestic divide.",
      "\u201cLet us move forward with hope and make a fresh start from this moment on,\u201d he said. \u201cThough we may have clashed for some time, even those who did not support us are still our fellow citizens of the Republic of Korea.\u201d",
      "Lee, who served as governor of Gyeonggi province and mayor of Seongnam city, has been a highly divisive figure in politics for years.",
      "As a former child laborer known for his inspirational rags-to-riches story, Lee came to fame through biting criticism of the country\u2019s conservative establishment and calls to build a more assertive South Korea in foreign policy. That rhetoric has given him an image as someone who can institute sweeping reforms and fix the country\u2019s deep-seated economic inequality and corruption.",
      "His critics view him as a dangerous populist who relies on political division and backpedals on promises too easily.",
      "On foreign policy, Lee has vowed to pursue pragmatic diplomacy. He has promised to develop the alliance with the U.S. and solidify a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo partnership, a stance that isn't much different from the position held by South Korea\u2019s conservatives.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll have to now see if the pressures of office will cause Lee Jae-myung to govern from the center \u2014 at least when it comes to matters of national security and the alliance with the United States,\u201d said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Lee said that he would pursue better ties with North Korea, but acknowledged that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un anytime soon. This signals Lee won't likely initiate any drastic steps meant to improve relations with North Korea.",
      "Experts say there aren\u2019t many diplomatic options for South Korea as it tries to address Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and calls for South Korea to pay more for the cost of the U.S. military presence, as well as North Korea\u2019s headlong pursuit of nuclear weapons. Experts say that has made both Lee and other candidates avoid unveiling ambitious foreign policy goals.",
      "Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University, said that foreign policy strategists for Lee understand there isn\u2019t much South Korea can do to bring about a denuclearization of North Korea. Paik said Lee also doesn\u2019t share the Korean nationalistic zeal held by ex-liberal President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim Jong Un three times during his 2017-22 term.",
      "There are still hopes that diplomacy between the U.S. and North Korea could resume, with Trump repeatedly expressing his intent to reach out to Kim Jong Un. Lee has said that he would support Trump's outreach.",
      "\u201cSouth Korea and the United States may be better aligned on engaging North Korea under the current constellation of leadership in both countries,\u201d Panda said. \u201cThe two sides should begin consultations soon to ensure they\u2019re aligned on their goals.\u201d",
      "Lee\u2019s government still could become engaged in \u201ca little bit of friction\u201d with the Trump administration, said Chung Jin-young, a former dean of the Graduate School of Pan-Pacific International Studies at South Korea\u2019s Kyung Hee University.",
      "Chung predicted Lee still won\u2019t be able to pursue overly drastic steps on foreign policy and security, given the country\u2019s foreign exchange and financial markets are vulnerable to such changes.",
      "Lee has preached patience over Trump\u2019s tariff policy, arguing it would be a mistake to rush negotiations in pursuit of an early agreement with Washington.",
      "On Monday, South Korean trade officials held an emergency meeting to discuss a response to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will raise tariffs on steel and aluminum products to 50% beginning Wednesday. South Korea\u2019s central bank last week sharply lowered its 2025 growth outlook to 0.8%, citing the potential impact of Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and weak domestic demand worsened by the political turmoil of past months.",
      "The election serves as another defining moment in the country\u2019s resilient democracy, but observers worry a worsened domestic divide could pose a big political burden on the new president.",
      "The past six months saw large crowds of people rallying to either denounce or support Yoon, while a leadership vacuum caused by Yoon\u2019s impeachment and ensuing formal dismissal rattled the country\u2019s high-level diplomatic activities and financial markets.",
      "Lee has promised to heal the national split, but his vow to thoroughly hold those involved in Yoon's martial law stunt accountable has sparked concerns that he would use investigations to launch political retaliations against his opponents.",
      "\u201cThe next question is just how Lee will represent and protect South Korea\u2019s democracy,\u201d said Soo Kim, a former CIA Korea analyst and geopolitical risk consultant.",
      "\u201cWill South Korea\u2019s politics still remain focused on retribution, or will Seoul finally look beyond this and work constructively and progressively for the country\u2019s best long-term democratic interests?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tall order for Lee.\u201d",

      "U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year from 2.8% last year as President Donald Trump\u2019s erratic trade wars disrupt global commerce, drive up costs and leave businesses and consumers paralyzed by uncertainty",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year from 2.8% last year as President Donald Trump\u2019s erratic trade wars disrupt global commerce, drive up costs and leave businesses and consumers paralyzed by uncertainty.",
      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Tuesday that the U.S. economy \u2014 the world's largest \u2014 will slow further to just 1.5% in 2026. Trump\u2019s policies have raised average U.S. tariff rates from around 2.5% when he returned to the White House to 15.4%, highest since 1938, according to the OECD. Tariffs raise costs for consumers and American manufacturers that rely on imported raw materials and components.",
      "World economic growth will slow to just 2.9% this year and stay there in 2026, according to the OECD's forecast. It marks a substantial deceleration from growth of 3.3% global growth last year and 3.4% in 2023.",
      "The world economy has proven remarkably resilient in recent years, continuing to expand steadily \u2014 though unspectacularly \u2014 in the face of global shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But global trade and the economic outlook have been clouded by Trump's sweeping taxes on imports, the unpredictable way he's rolled them out and the threat of retaliation from other countries.",
      "Reversing decades of U.S. policy in favor of freer world trade, Trump has levied 10% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country on earth along with specific duties on steel, aluminum and autos. He's also threatened more import taxes, including a doubling of his tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%.",
      "Without mentioning Trump by name, OECD chief economist \u00c1lvaro Pereira wrote in a commentary that accompanied the forecast that \"we have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment.''",
      "Adding to the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s trade wars: A federal court in New York last week blocked most of Trump\u2019s tariffs, ruling that he\u2019d overstepped his authority in imposing them. Then an appeals court allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the taxes while appeals worked their way through the U.S. courts.",
      "China \u2014 the world's second-biggest economy \u2014 is forecast to see growth decelerate from 5% last year to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026. Chinese exporters will be hurt by Trump's tariffs, hobbling an economy already weakened by the collapse of the nation's real estate market. Some of the damage will be offset by help from the government: Beijing last month outlined plans to cut interest rates and encourage bank lending as well as allocating more money for factory upgrades and elder care, among other things.",
      "The 20 countries that share the euro currency will collectively see economic growth pick up from 0.8% last year to 1% in 2025 and 1.2% next year, the OECD said, helped by interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank.",
      "The Paris-based OECD, comprising 38 member countries, works to promote international trade and prosperity and issues periodic reports and analyses.",

      "The head of the U.S. Energy Department says President Donald Trump wants to double the amount of oil coursing through Alaska\u2019s 800-mile pipeline system and build a massive natural gas export project as its twin",
      "DEADHORSE, Alaska -- President Donald Trump wants to double the amount of oil coursing through Alaska's vast pipeline system and build a massive natural gas project as its \u201cbig, beautiful twin,\u201d a top administration official said Monday while touring a prolific oil field near the Arctic Ocean.",
      "The remarks by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright came as he and two other Trump Cabinet members \u2014 Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin \u2014 visited Prudhoe Bay as part of a multiday trip aimed at highlighting Trump\u2019s push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state that drew criticism from environmentalists.",
      "During the trip, Burgum\u2019s agency announced plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in portions of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.",
      "The petroleum reserve is west of Prudhoe Bay and Deadhorse, the industrial encampment near the starting point of the trans-Alaska pipeline system. The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska\u2019s economic lifeline for nearly 50 years.",
      "Government and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials\u2019 trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday.",
      "For years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.",
      "Oil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape.",
      "\u201cYou have the big two right here,\" he said. \u201cLet\u2019s double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\u201d",
      "Oil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 \u2014 a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day.",
      "Those joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik.",
      "In Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump\u2019s push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.",
      "Alaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.",
      "Murkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \u201cwant to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\u201d",
      "Environmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed.",
      "Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \u201cvery frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.",
      "The three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

      "A construction project on one of Newark Liberty International Airport's three main runways wrapped up nearly two weeks early, so the Federal Aviation Administration should be able to ease flight limits soon, but the shortage of air traffic controllers could still cause problems.",
      "Federal Transportation Department officials plan to join the CEO of United Airlines and airport officials in providing an update on operations at New Jersey\u2019s biggest airport Monday afternoon. The runway was scheduled to go back into service Monday, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.",
      "Crews worked day and night to complete the $121 million construction project ahead of schedule and ease some of the problems at the airport. But Newark has also been plagued by cancellations and delays this spring because of a shortage of air traffic controllers after the FAA had technical problems that twice briefly knocked out the radar and communications at a facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of the airport.",
      "\u201cCompleting this major portion of the runway rehabilitation 13 days ahead of schedule is a testament to the extraordinary commitment and around-the-clock efforts of construction crews and our airport staff,\u201d said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O\u2019Toole.",
      "The FAA didn't immediately answer questions Monday morning about when operations might change at the Newark airport.",
      "Five air traffic controllers went on 45-day trauma leaves after the first radar and communications outage at the Philadelphia facility on April 28, and another one is out on medical leave. That left the facility with only 16 certified controllers and five supervisors. Officials have said there are another 16 experienced controllers in training that should get certified sometime between now and October.",
      "The FAA limited the Newark airport to 28 arrivals and 28 departures an hour last month because of the construction and staff shortages. The agency has said that it expects to be able to bump up the number of flights daily in Newark to 34 arrivals and 34 departures once the runway construction is done. But it's not immediately clear if the FAA will have to wait until the controllers on trauma leave are scheduled to return around the middle of the month.",
      "Before the air traffic control problems this spring, 38 or 39 flights typically took off and landed hourly at the Newark airport.",
      "The FAA has said it will revisit the limits again in October because it hopes to have more controllers trained by then.",
      "The government also upgraded the software at the air traffic control facility after a second radar outage on May 9. That helped prevent a repeat problem on May 11 when there was another problem with the lines carrying the radar signal down from New York.",
      "Verizon has installed a new fiber optic line between Philadelphia and New York after the problems but that isn't expected to go into service until July after testing is completed.",

      "The European Union is preparing \u201ccountermeasures\u201d against the United States if the two sides cannot reach a deal after surprise U.S. tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing negotiations between Brussels and Washington",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The European Union on Monday said it is preparing \u201ccountermeasures\u201d against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.",
      "EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to \u201caccelerate talks\u201d on a deal, but that if those trade negotiations fail \u201cthen we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side,\" European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.",
      "\u201cIn the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,\u201d Gill said.",
      "He said the EU is finalizing an \u201cexpanded list of countermeasures\u201d that would \u201cautomatically take effect on July 14 or earlier.\u201d That\u2019s the date when a 90-day pause, intended to ease negotiations, ends in tariffs announced by the two economic powerhouses on each other. About halfway through that grace period, Trump announced a 50% tariffs on steel imports.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away. Top officials at the EU\u2019s executive commission says they\u2019re pushing hard for a trade deal to avoid a 50% tariff on imported goods.",
      "The EU could possibly buy more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the U.S., as well as lower duties on cars, but it isn't likely to budge on calls to scrap the value added tax \u2014 which is akin to a sales tax \u2014 or open up the EU to American beef.",
      "The EU has offered the US a \u201czero for zero\u201d outcome in which tariffs would be removed on both sides industrial goods including autos. Trump has dismissed that but EU officials have said it\u2019s still on the table.",
      "The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on steel imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are so ubiquitous in packaging, they\u2019re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.",

      "LONDON -- The United Kingdom will build new nuclear-powered attack submarines, get its army ready to fight a war in Europe and become \u201ca battle-ready, armor-clad nation,\u201d Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday, part of a boost to military spending designed to send a message to Moscow \u2014 and Washington.",
      "Starmer said Britain \u201ccannot ignore the threat that Russia poses\u201d as he pledged to undertake the most sweeping changes to Britain's defenses since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than three decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe threat we face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer told workers and journalists at a navy shipyard in Scotland.",
      "Like other NATO members, the U.K. has been reassessing its defense spending since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The government announced military plans in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It's the first such review since 2021, and lands in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and by the re-election of President Donald Trump last year.",
      "Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \u201cfighting big tank battles on European landmass\u201d are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.",
      "Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air sea and in cyberspace.",
      "The measures include increasing production of submarines and weapons and \u201clearning the lessons of Ukraine,\" which has rapidly developed its drone technology to counter Moscow's forces and even hit targets deep inside Russia.",
      "The government said the U.K, will also establish a cyber command to counter \u201cdaily\u201d Russia-linked attacks on Britain's defenses.",
      "Monday\u2019s announcements include building \u201cup to 12\u201d nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds in Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret.",
      "The government will also increase conventional Britain\u2019s weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.",
      "Starmer said rearming would create a \u201cdefense dividend\u201d of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs \u2014 a contrast to the post-Cold War \u201cpeace dividend\u201d that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \u201ca message to Moscow,\u201d and transform the country\u2019s military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a two-century low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.",
      "Healey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \u201con track\u201d and that there\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d it will hit 3% before 2034.",
      "Starmer said the 3% goal is an \u201cambition,\u201d rather than a firm promise, and it\u2019s unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.",
      "Starmer said he wouldn\u2019t make a firm pledge until he knew \u201cprecisely where the money is coming from.\u201d",
      "Even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.",
      "It's also a message to Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defense.",
      "European countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don\u2019t pull their weight.",
      "Starmer said his government would make \u201cBritain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will never fight alone,\u201d he said. \u201cOur defense policy will always be NATO-first.\u201d",

      "Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist conservative, as its next president \u2014 a win that signals a turn to the right in one of the European Union's member states",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian and staunch nationalist, as its next president in a closely watched vote that signals a resurgence of right-wing populism in the heart of Europe.",
      "Nawrocki, who is set to take office on Aug. 6, is expected to shape the country\u2019s domestic and foreign policy in ways that could strain ties with Brussels while aligning the Central European nation of nearly 38 million people more closely with the administration of President Donald Trump in the United States.",
      "Here are some key takeaways:",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s victory underscores the enduring appeal of nationalist rhetoric among about half of the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union, and its deep social divisions.",
      "The 42-year-old historian who had no previous political experience built his campaign on patriotic themes, traditional Catholic values, and a vow to defend Poland's sovereignty against the EU and larger European nations like Germany.",
      "His win also reflects the appeal of right-wing nationalism across Europe, where concerns about migration, national sovereignty, and cultural identity have led to surging support for parties on the right \u2014 even the far right in recent times.",
      "Far-right candidates did very well in Poland's first round of voting two weeks earlier, underlining the appeal of the nationalist and conservative views. Nawrocki picked up many of those votes.",
      "As his supporters celebrate his win, those who voted for the defeated liberal candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, worry that it will hasten the erosion of liberal democratic norms.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s presidency presents a direct challenge to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who returned to power in late 2023 pledging to mend relations with the EU and restore judicial independence which Brussels said was eroded by Law and Justice, the party that backed Nawrocki.",
      "But Tusk's coalition \u2014 a fragile alliance of centrists, leftists, and agrarian conservatives \u2014 has struggled to push through key promises including a civil union law for same-sex couples and a less restrictive abortion law.",
      "Nawrocki, who opposes such measures, will have the power to veto legislation, complicating Tusk\u2019s agenda and potentially triggering political gridlock.",
      "Nawrocki's election could signal a stronger relationship between Poland and the Trump administration.",
      "Poland and the U.S. are close allies, and there are 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in Poland, but Tusk and his partners in the past have been critical of Trump. Nawrocki, however, has a worldview closely aligned with Trump and his Make America Great Again ethos.",
      "Trump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago and his administration made clear in other ways that he was its preferred candidate.",
      "While Nawrocki has voiced support for Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russian aggression, he does not back Ukrainian membership in NATO and has questioned the long-term costs of aid \u2014 particularly support for refugees.",
      "His rhetoric has at times echoed that of Trump, for instance by accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of what he said was insufficient gratitude for Poland\u2019s assistance. With growing public fatigue over helping Ukrainian refugees, Nawrocki\u2019s approach could shift Poland\u2019s posture from strong ally to conditional partner if the war drags on much longer.",
      "The election result is a setback for the EU, which had welcomed Tusk\u2019s return in 2023 as a signal of renewed pro-European engagement.",
      "Nawrocki and the Law and Justice party have criticized what nationalists view as EU overreach into Poland's national affairs, especially regarding judicial reforms and migration policy.",
      "While the president does not control day-to-day diplomacy, Nawrocki\u2019s symbolic and veto powers could frustrate Brussels\u2019 efforts to bring Poland back into alignment with bloc standards, particularly on rule-of-law issues.",
      "Though an EU member, Poland has its own currency, the zloty, which weakened slightly on Monday morning, reflecting investor concerns over potential policy instability and renewed tensions with EU institutions.",
      "Billions of euros in EU funding has been linked to judicial reforms which Tusk's government will now be unlikely to enact without presidential cooperation.",

      "The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. And businesses and investors must contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",

      "And in response to recent comments by Trump, it said of the U.S.: \u201cInstead of reflecting on itself, it has turned the tables and unreasonably accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts.\u201d",
      "Trump stirred further controversy Friday, saying he will no longer be nice with China on trade, declaring in a social media post that the country had broken an agreement with the United States.",
      "Hours later, Trump said in the Oval Office that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and \u201chopefully we\u2019ll work that out,\u201d while still insisting China had violated the agreement.",
      "\u201cThe bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cSo much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\u201d",
      "The Trump administration also stepped up the clash with China in other ways last week, announcing that it would start revoking visas for Chinese students studying in the U.S.",
      "U.S. campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "Both countries are in a race to develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, with Washington seeking to curb China\u2019s access to the most advanced computer chips.

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "\u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d has once again placed first on the box office charts",
      "\u201cLilo & Stich\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u2014The Final Reckoning\u201d dominated the box office charts again after fueling a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend. Theaters in the U.S. and Canada had several new films to offer this weekend as well, including Sony\u2019s family friendly \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d and the A24 horror movie \u201cBring Her Back. \u201d According to studio estimates Sunday, it added up to a robust $149 million post-holiday weekend that\u2019s up over 120% from the same timeframe last year.",
      "Disney\u2019s live-action hybrid \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d took first place again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. It was enough to pass \u201cSinners\u201d to become the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Globally, its running total is $610.8 million. \u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, is still going strong in its seventh weekend with another $5.2 million, bumping it to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million globally.",
      "The eighth \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie also repeated in second place, with $27.3 million from 3,861 locations. As with \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d that's down 57% from its opening. With $122.6 million in domestic tickets sold, it\u2019s performing in line with the two previous installments. But with a reported production budget of $400 million, profitability is a ways off. Internationally, it added $76.1 million (including $25.2 million from China where it just opened), bringing its global total to $353.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis is the year of longterm playability,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst. \u201cThe currency of word of mouth and the strong hold is more important than opening weekend dollars.\u201d",
      "Leading the newcomers was Sony\u2019s \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d with an estimated $21 million from 3,809 locations. The movie brings Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio together to train a new kid, the kung fu prodigy Li Fong ( Ben Wang ). Chan starred in a 2010 reboot of the 1984 original, while Macchio has found a new generation of fans in the series \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d which just concluded a six-season run.",
      "Reviews might have been mixed, but opening weekend audiences gave the PG-13 rated film a strong A- CinemaScore and 4.5 stars on PostTrak. It also only cost a reported $45 million to produce and has several weeks until a new family-friendly film arrives. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d opened earlier internationally and has a worldwide total of $47 million.",
      "Fourth place went \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d which earned $10.8 million in its third weekend. The movie is the highest-grossing in the franchise, not accounting for inflation, with $229.3 million globally.",
      "The weekend\u2019s other big newcomer, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d rounded out the top five with $7.1 million from 2,449 screens. Starring Sally Hawkins as a foster mother with some disturbing plans, the film is the sophomore feature of twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou, who made the 2023 horror breakout \u201cTalk to Me.\u201d It earned a rare-for-horror B+ CinemaScore and is essentially the only new film in the genre until \u201c28 Years Later\u201d opens on June 20.",
      "A new Wes Anderson movie, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d also debuted in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, where it made $270,000. It expands nationwide next weekend.",
      "The summer box office forecast remains promising, though there\u2019s a long way to go to get to the $4 billion target (a pre-pandemic norm that only the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer has surpassed). The month of May is expected to close out with $973 million \u2013 up 75% from May 2024, according to data from Comscore.",
      "With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",

      "The Minnesota Timberwolves have plenty of reason to run back the same roster after reaching the Western Conference finals for the second straight time",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Timberwolves have plenty of reason to run back the same roster after reaching the Western Conference finals for the second straight time.",
      "But that was their initial assessment last year, too, before the big trade went down right before the beginning of training camp. Not many moves can be ruled out, particularly in this era of the NBA that never seems far from the next surprising swap involving star players.",
      "\u201cWe feel very happy with the core we have. We don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s tremendous pressure to do much,\" president of basketball operations Tim Connelly said. \"But until you\u2019re raising the trophy, you\u2019ve got to be as active and as creative as possible to get to the point where you\u2019re the final team.\u201d",
      "Connelly later added: \u201cThose organizations that can show patience tend to have a really high level of success. But patience shouldn\u2019t lead to risk aversion. If there\u2019s something that if we have to shake it up and make us a better team, we\u2019re certainly open to that.\u201d",
      "The most pressing matters for Connelly and the front office over the next month will be negotiations with the agents for Julius Randle and Naz Reid, the two power forwards with vastly different styles and backgrounds who both face the same decision on whether to exercise a contract option for 2025-26 or decline it to become a free agent.",
      "Randle's is for more than $30 million, a deal inherited from the New York Knicks when he was acquired with Donte DiVincenzo in the trade that sent away cornerstone Karl-Anthony Towns. He raved about settling his family in Minnesota and playing for Chris Finch, and his performance during the first two rounds of the playoffs was superb, until some struggles against Oklahoma City in the conference finals.",
      "Reid's is for about $15 million, making him at age 25 more likely to opt out in favor of a larger and longer deal. But that doesn't mean the Timberwolves won't be aggressive about trying to bring the fan favorite back.",
      "\u201cI would tell you I was optimistic even if I was lying to you, but we\u2019re pretty optimistic. Those guys are really really good players who play really really well together,\" Connelly said. \"We have nothing but positive indicators both of these guys will be in Wolves jerseys next season.\u201d",
      "Nickeil Alexander-Walker, another vital part of the eight-player rotation, will be an unrestricted free agent. Connelly gave no indication he'll be limited by ownership in what he can commit to player salaries, but after spending this season above the NBA's second apron for team payrolls the Wolves clearly have little appetite for staying there \u2014 not just because of the steep tax but for the roster-building penalties that come with spending that high on the scale.",
      "Bringing back Alexander-Walker as well as Randle and Reid without again passing the second apron might be impossible.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to keep everybody. What\u2019s neat is the players are all very happy here. They love the coaching staff, they love the teammates, they love the community. When the player wants to be here and the team wants to have them back, there\u2019s always room for optimism. Certainly these guys have finite windows to earn a lot of money. We\u2019re very appreciative of what the market might look like. We\u2019re pretty cautiously optimistic we\u2019re in a good place with all of the guys.\u201d",
      "The other factor in play is the desire to increase the roles for rookies Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr. and second-year player Jaylen Clark, who was essentially a rookie in 2024-25 after sitting his first season out in recovery from an Achilles tendon injury. The Wolves also have the 17th and 31st overall picks in the NBA draft later this month.",
      "One key figure for this franchise whose future appears settled is Connelly, who agreed to push back by a year an option on his contract that would essentially make him a free agent out of deference to the ownership transfer process that was complicated at the time. After an arbitration panel sided with the group fronted by Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez in a decision reached in February, the sale by Glen Taylor is awaiting final NBA approval.",
      "\u201cSuper happy here. It\u2019s been great \u2014 not just as working with the team, but this whole community really feels like home,\u201d Connelly said. \u201cI think you guys are stuck with me.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- Lo\u00efs Boisson had never played at the French Open, let alone in the biggest arena at Roland-Garros.",
      "They didn't faze the French wild card.",
      "Boisson, ranked 361st, threw her head back and roared after beating American No. 3 Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Court Philippe-Chatrier in Monday's fourth-round play.",
      "She is by far the lowest-ranked woman to beat someone ranked in the top five at the French Open in 40 years. The lowest previously in that span was No. 179 Aniko Kapros, who eliminated No. 5 Justine Henin in the first round in 2002.",
      "Boisson also is the lowest-ranked woman to reach the quarterfinals at Roland-Garros since at least 1985.",
      "Quite some victory, considering also Pegula was the U.S. Open runner-up last year. Understandably, Boisson was nervous as she served for the match and saved three break points.",
      "After Pegula missed an easy-looking winner at the net and clutched her head in her hands, Boisson had her first match point, the biggest point of her career.",
      "Pegula returned a strong serve to the back of the court where Boisson unleashed a brilliant forehand winner down the line. She then raised her arms and realized the enormity of her win.",
      "\u201c\u2018Thank you to all of you,'\" Boisson told the crowd in her post-match interview. \u201cPlaying on this court with such an atmosphere was really incredible.\u201d",
      "Boisson made the notoriously hard-to-please crowd laugh when she added: \u201cI'm really happy on here. I can stay a long time if you like.\u201d",
      "The crowd broke into chants of \u201cLo\u00efs, Lo\u00efs\" and she waved back to them.",
      "She was in the news last month. British player Harriet Dart apologized to Boisson after asking the chair umpire to tell her to put some deodorant on. Now she's the only French player \u2014 male or female \u2014 left at Roland-Garros. But she feels comfortable on clay, having played on it regularly since taking up tennis when she was eight years old.",
      "Asked what her ambitions were for the rest of the tournament \u2014 she plays sixth-seeded Mirra Andreeva on Wednesday in the quarterfinals \u2014 she replied, \u201cI hope to win, right?\u201d",
      "That prompted more laughter from the crowd, which included tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, who has been criticized by some for the lack of women players in night sessions.",
      "Top-ranked Jannik Sinner was playing his fourth-round match later Monday in the night session against No. 17 Andrey Rublev, following 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic's match against Britain's Cameron Norrie.",

She playfully threw her wristband at Andreeva when they came to the net and Andreeva joked she would keep it.",
      "No. 7 Madison Keys advanced on Court Suzanne-Lenglen after beating Hailey Baptiste 6-3, 7-5 in an all-American contest. There's another one coming for Keys against Gauff.",

      "LEBANON, Tenn. -- Bubba Wallace sees NASCAR having all the momentum possible right now with different media partners.",
      "Perfect timing then for NASCAR's \u201cIn-season Challenge\u201d to debut, right?",
      "Well, Wallace forgot that was about to debut.",
      "\u201cFor me to forget about it and remember how exciting it was when they announced, I think it\u2019s going to be big for the fans to tune in and and give them a little bit more ... you\u2019re just invested more,\" Wallace said.",
      "Kyle Larson just tried his latest attempt at \u201cthe Double\u201d of the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600. Count him among those who didn't realize NASCAR's new in-season competition had its field of 32 set after Sunday night's Cup Series race at the Nashville Superspeedway.",
      "\u201cI just really haven\u2019t seen anything promoted about it, so I think it\u2019s easy to forget about it,\" Larson said.",
      "NASCAR announced this new in-season competition in May 2024, so drivers can be forgiven for being focused on the second half of the season.",
      "The format is simple: 32 drivers race for seeding over the next three races starting at Michigan on Sunday and concluding at Pocono on June 22. Drivers are seeded by their best finish for the five-race competition starting at Atlanta.",
      "Then it goes to single elimination with the field cut to 16 at Chicago, eight at Sonoma, four at Dover and the final two at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The winner gets $1 million, and that does get drivers' attention as part of the new media rights deal that includes TNT.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be something fun that you pay attention to, and there\u2019s good money on the line,\u201d said Larson, the 2021 Cup Series champ. \u201cSo, you've just got to be really consistent throughout.\u201d",
      "Chris Buescher of RFK Racing is among those who didn't realize this challenge is starting. He needs race victories after losing points for a penalty at Kansas in May. The prize is nice.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s real money,\" Buescher said. \"But I don\u2019t want that to change how we go to the race track. We need to figure out how to win races. There\u2019s a lot more than that on the line at the end of the year.\u201d",
      "Three-time Cup Series champ Joey Logano compared this event's prize to the money up for grabs in the All-Star Race and this new competition like a stage win.",
      "\u201cThis is a little longer thing, but it\u2019s a race within the race,\" Logano said. \u201cSo you\u2019re not willing to give up a lot to do that, right?\u201d",
      "Denny Hamlin was excited when the In-season Challenge was first announced. Then he saw the courses for this competition, and his enthusiasm dimmed with the number of road courses included.",
      "\u201cTruthfully, we\u2019re going to get pretty lucky or have such a good draw that just things kind of work out,\" Hamlin said. \"I wish it was more conventional ovals, but I think that\u2019s just the way the schedule works out. And it\u2019s unfortunately not probably my prime part of the season.\u201d",
      "Brad Keselowski and his No. 6 Ford for RFK Racing went into Nashville at 32 \u2014 right on the line to be included in that chase for seeding. He hadn't given the competition much thought focused on this season. But he thinks it will be fun once it starts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good for the sport, good for our fans and it\u2019s a competition,\u201d Keselowski said. \"If there\u2019s competition, we want to win it. But that said, I think our heads down on one week at a time, in some ways one day at a time. ... And it\u2019s hard to look further ahead than that.\u201d",
      "With Ryan Blaney's first victory of the season at Nashville Superspeedway, Team Penske now has its three drivers qualified for the NASCAR Cup playoffs even with Nashville the first race of the second half of this year.",
      "Blaney, who hadn't won since November, joined Austin Cindric, who won at Talladega, and three-time Cup Series champ Joey Logano, a winner at Texas. Josh Berry, whose Wood Brothers Racing team has a relationship with Team Penske, also won at Las Vegas.",
      "Michael Nelson, president of Team Penske's NASCAR operations, said it was nice to have that pressure off all the teams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s obviously pretty awesome to have a little bit of that pressure off for the guys,\" Nelson said. \"And again ... it gives you a chance to go out and take some chances here and there and try to rack up a bunch of wins. So now we\u2019re grateful to be at this point with our cars this time of year.\u201d",
      "Carson Hocevar matched his career-best finish driving from 26th to second at Nashville. The 22-year-old driver in his second Cup Series season with Spire Motorsports ticked off Ricky Stenhouse Jr. with his aggressive style.",
      "Hocevar clipped Stenhouse on Lap 106 of 300, sending him into the wall and out of the race. Stenhouse said Hocevar was overly aggressive and will talk to the young driver. Just not after the race.",
      "\u201cNo,\" Stenhouse said, \"that costs too much money.\u201d",

      "Tyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner beamed as they carried the Indiana Pacers shiny, new Eastern Conference championship trophy into their postgame news conferences Saturday night",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The Pacers have finally ended the franchise's 25-year NBA Finals drought, achieving the unthinkable after starting 10-15 and looking like anything but a title contender.",
      "Now Indiana will try to exorcise the demons of its decades-long, snake-bitten history and actually win the title when the Pacers take on the Oklahoma City in the NBA Finals.",
      "\u201cIt is really a special thing that happened 25 years ago, I wasn\u2019t even six months old,\u201d Tyrese Haliburton said after Indiana's series-ending victory over New York. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fans who have never seen success from this organization, especially people around my age. They weren\u2019t alive for it.",
      "\"So it\u2019s really special what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re just trying to keep making this a special place, a place where people want to come.\u201d",
      "The Pacers play in a state where basketball is treated like religion, championship teams become royals and players and coaches emerge as revered figures when they achieve the unexpected like these Pacers.",
      "But Indiana hasn't always been that dream destination for NBA players, instead being tabbed as snake-bitten franchise for most of its 48 seasons in the league.",
      "\u2014 After winning three ABA titles, it took a telethon to save the financially floundering NBA newbie in July 1977.",
      "\u2014 The Pacers made just one playoff appearance during their first decade in the NBA, losing both games to Philadelphia.",
      "\u2014 Fans booed resoundingly when the Pacers used a first-round draft pick on Reggie Miller in 1987 instead of home-state favorite Steve Alford.",
      "\u2014 And their pathway to championships in the 1990s seemed hopelessly blocked by Michael Jordan's Bulls or Patrick Ewing's the Knicks until the breakthrough run in 2000 only to lose to Shaquille O'Neal, the late Kobe Bryant and the Lakers.",
      "And though Miller was still playing at a high level, it has taken another quarter-century to make it back.",
      "The journey hasn't been an easy one.",
      "This Pacers team rallied to eliminate some other snake-bitten opponents. They knocked out the 2021 NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks, the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers and the rival Knicks. The second final chapter begins Thursday in Oklahoma City.",
      "The expectations were different 25 years ago.",
      "Donnie Walsh revamped Indiana's roster by surrounding Miller with younger players following the 1999-2000 season, and four seasons later the Pacers posted the league's best record in 2003-04. They wound up losing the conference final in six games to Detroit.",
      "Then came the franchise-changing Malice in the Palace brawl in November 2004.",
      "Several lengthy suspensions gutted the team, derailing Miller's last title run while sending the franchise into a downward spiral. Larry Bird fired coach Rick Carlisle, his friend and ex-teammate, two years later and his departure was followed by a rash of devastating injuries.",
      "Danny Granger's budding career was cut short by knee tendinitis. Paul George suffered a compound fracture in his right leg in 2014 and he was traded to Oklahoma City in 2017. Two years later, All-Star guard Victor Oladipo ruptured his right quadriceps tendon and was subsequently traded, too.",
      "Myles Turner experienced most of the ups and downs of that decade from the Pacers locker room, and it only made his opportunity to hug Miller and Nancy Leonard, the widow of former Pacers longtime coach and broadcaster Bobby \u201cSlick\u201d Leonard, so much sweeter after winning the conference crown.",
      "\u201cIt was just pure excitement, pure validation,\" Turner said. \u201cJust all the years, all the hate, all the love, everything in between. So, man, in that moment, it was just pure exuberance.\u201d",
      "Turner was a pivotal piece \u2014 not the central one \u2014 when president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard embarked on another rebuild midway through the 2021-22 season to form the core of this year's squad.",
      "He started by dealing All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis to Sacramento for Haliburton. Five months later, Indiana acquired forward Aason Nesmith from Boston for Malcolm Brogdon. And when Pritchard sent Bruce Brown to Toronto for Pascal Siakam in January 2024, Pritchard figured the Pacers finally had their big three.",
      "Fans were skeptical, but the Pacers ushered in a new era of basketball, one that combined Indiana's favorite sport with its longtime auto racing tradition, creating a track-like pace brand of basketball.",
      "In some ways, these Pacers are a throwback to their ABA roots \u2014 fast, high scoring, flurries of 3-pointers and made-for-television entertainment right down to the dance team.",
      "\u201cThe pace, it just fits who I am as a person, like the way I play the game,\u201d said Siakam, who won a championship ring with Toronto. \u201cWe have a lot of people who look down on us as an underdog and that's my style. I like that because that's been me my whole life.\u201d",
      "The Pacers will open as the underdog against the Thunder, the team George landed with all those years ago. Two former ABA powers, San Antonio and Denver, have won NBA titles. But if the Pacers can capture the Larry O'Brien trophy, they would be the league's only team to be crowned ABA and NBA champions.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to be popping champagne,\u201d said Carlisle, who led the Dallas Mavericks to the 2010-11 title. \u201cGetting to the NBA Finals is an accomplishment. But if you start looking at it that way, you'll go into it with the wrong mindset. When you get to this point of the season, its two teams, it's one goal so it becomes an all or nothing thing.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhy is there a spiral there?\u201d said the museum's Jackie Faherty.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",

Another one headed toward Earth on Monday could produce more aurora sightings.",
      "Authorities are monitoring for possible disruptions, though the worst is already over. The weekend\u2019s storms may have caused brief disruptions to high-frequency radio, said Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Auroras could be visible \u2014 especially in darker, rural areas \u2014 in Alaska, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine and northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Iowa, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about auroras and how to spot them.",
      "The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.",
      "Last spring, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And last fall, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major facelift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",
      "Severe storms are capable of scrambling radio and GPS communications.",
      "The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.",
      "Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.",
      "When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit.",
      "In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and caught telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.",
      "Space weather experts aren\u2019t able to predict a solar storm months in advance. Instead, they alert relevant parties to prepare in the days before a solar outburst hits Earth.",
      "Northern lights forecasts can be found on NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app.",
      "Consider aurora-watching in a quiet, dark area away from city lights. Experts recommend skygazing from a local or national park. And check the weather forecast because clouds can cover up the spectacle entirely.",

      "Past theories put a collision between the two \u2014 resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda \u2014 as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner.",
      "For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way's movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances.",
      "Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years.",
      "\u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study,",
      "A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy's name.",
      "More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what's happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos.",
      "While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\" according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\"",

      "Scientists say 4 billion people, about half the world\u2019s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses, and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cAlthough floods and cyclones often dominate headlines, heat is arguably the deadliest extreme event,\u201d the report said. Many heat-related deaths are unreported or are mislabeled by other conditions like heart disease or kidney failure.",
      "The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries in the world, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change.",
      "Caribbean islands were among the hardest hit by additional extreme heat days. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, endured 161 days of extreme heat. Without climate change, only 48 would have occurred.",
      "\u201cIt makes it feel impossible to be outside,\u201d said Charlotte Gossett Navarro, chief director for Puerto Rico at Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit focused on social and environmental issues in Latino communities, who lives in the San Juan area and was not involved in the report.",
      "\u201cEven something as simple as trying to have a day outdoors with family, we weren\u2019t able to do it because the heat was too high,\" she said, reporting feeling dizzy and sick last summer.",
      "When the power goes out, which happens frequently in Puerto Rico in part because of decades of neglected grid maintenance and damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017, Navarro said it is difficult to sleep. \u201cIf you are someone relatively healthy, that is uncomfortable, it\u2019s hard to sleep ... but if you are someone who has a health condition, now your life is at risk,\u201d Gossett Navarro said.",
      "Heat waves are silent killers, said Friederike Otto, associate professor of climate science at Imperial College London, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fall dead on the street in a heat wave ... people either die in hospitals or in poorly insulated homes and therefore are just not seen,\u201d he said.",
      "Low-income communities and vulnerable populations, such as older adults and people with medical conditions, suffer the most from extreme heat.",
      "The high temperatures recorded in the extreme heat events that occurred in Central Asia in March, South Sudan in February and in the Mediterranean last July would have not been possible without climate change, according to the report. At least 21 people died in Morocco after temperatures hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) last July. People are noticing temperatures are getting hotter but don't always know it is being driven by climate change, said Roop Singh, head of urban and attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, in a World Weather Attribution statement.",
      "\u201cWe need to quickly scale our responses to heat through better early warning systems, heat action plans, and long-term planning for heat in urban areas to meet the rising challenge,\u201d Singh said.",
      "City-led initiatives to tackle extreme heat are becoming popular in parts of South Asia, North America, Europe and Australia to coordinate resources across governments and other agencies. One example is a tree-planting initiative launched in Marseille, France, to create more shaded areas.",
      "The report says strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient.",
      "But without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.",

      "Google will return to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department's attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it's navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power.",
      "The legal and technological threats facing Google are among the key issues that will be dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared as an illegal monopoly by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last year.",
      "Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers will attempt to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.",
      "Google lawyers are expected to assert only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice's four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.",
      "\u201cOver weeks of testimony, we heard from a series of well-funded companies eager to gain access to Google\u2019s technology so they don\u2019t have to innovate themselves,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t hear was how DOJ\u2019s extreme proposals would benefit consumers.\u201d",
      "After the day-long closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can't take until the judge orders a remedy.",
      "While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry's future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.",
      "The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won't rein in Google's power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that's the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.",
      "Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet's main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.",
      "The debate over Google's fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.",
      "Apple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department's proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn't compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.",
      "In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department's proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company's business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.",
      "The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department's proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry.",
      "Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realize their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. \u201cDevelopers will be overcome by uncertainty\u201d if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",
      "Buy Y Combinator, an incubator that has helped create hundreds of startups collectively worth about $800 billion filed documents pushing for the dramatic overhaul of Google, whose immense power has discouraged venture capitalists from investing in areas that are considered to be part of the company's \u201ckill zone.\u201d",
      "Startups \u201calso need to be able to get their products into the hands of users, free from restrictive dealing and self-preferencing that locks up important distribution channels. As things stand, Google has locked up the most critical distribution channels, freezing the general search and search text advertising markets into static competition for more than a decade,\u201d Y Combinator told Mehta.",

      "In a pristine corner of the Amazon, Brazilian and British scientists have spent more than two decades simulating drought to understand how the rainforest might respond to a drier future",
      "CAXIUANA NATIONAL FOREST, Brazil -- A short walk beneath the dense Amazon canopy, the forest abruptly opens up. Fallen logs are rotting, the trees grow sparser and the temperature rises in places sunlight hits the ground. This is what 24 years of severe drought looks like in the world\u2019s largest rainforest.",
      "But this patch of degraded forest, about the size of a soccer field, is a scientific experiment. Launched in 2000 by Brazilian and British scientists, Esecaflor \u2014 short for \u201cForest Drought Study Project\u201d in Portuguese\u2014 set out to simulate a future in which the changing climate could deplete the Amazon of rainfall. It is the longest-running project of its kind in the world, and has become a source for dozens of academic articles in fields ranging from meteorology to ecology and physiology.",
      "Understanding how drought can affect the Amazon, an area twice the size of India that crosses into several South American nations, has implications far beyond the region. The rainforest stores a massive amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. According to one study, the Amazon stores the equivalent of two years of global carbon emissions, which mainly come from the burning of coal, oil and gasoline. When trees are cut, or wither and die from drought, they release into the atmosphere the carbon they were storing, which accelerates global warming.",
      "To mimic stress from drought, the project, located in the Caxiuana National Forest, assembled about 6,000 transparent plastic rectangular panels across one hectare (2.5 acres), diverting around 50% of the rainfall from the forest floor. They were set 1 meter above ground (3.3 ft) on the sides to 4 meters (13.1 ft) above ground in the center. The water was funneled into gutters and channeled through trenches dug around the plot\u2019s perimeter.",
      "Next to it, an identical plot was left untouched to serve as a control. In both areas, instruments were attached to trees, placed on the ground and buried to measure soil moisture, air temperature, tree growth, sap flow and root development, among other data. Two metal towers sit above each plot.",
      "In each tower, NASA radars measure how much water is in the plants, which helps researchers understand overall forest stress. The data is sent to the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where it is processed.",
      "\u201cThe forest initially appeared to be resistant to the drought,\" said Lucy Rowland, an ecology professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "That began to change about 8 years in, however. \"We saw a really big decline in biomass, big losses and mortality of the largest trees,\u201d said Rowland.",
      "This resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the total weight of the vegetation and the carbon stored within it from the plot. The main findings were detailed in a study published in May in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. It shows that during the years of vegetation loss, the rainforest shifted from a carbon sink, that is, a storer of carbon dioxide, to a carbon emitter, before eventually stabilizing.",
      "There was one piece of good news: the decades-long drought didn\u2019t turn the rainforest into a savanna, or large grassy plain, as earlier model-based studies had predicted.",
      "In November, most of the 6,000 transparent plastic covers were removed, and now scientists are observing how the forest changes. There is currently no end date for the project.",
      "\u201cThe forest has already adapted. Now we want to understand what happens next,\u201d said meteorologist Jo\u00e3o de Athaydes, vice coordinator of Esecaflor, a professor at the Federal University of Para and coauthor of the Nature study. \u201cThe idea is to see whether the forest can regenerate and return to the baseline from when we started the project.\u201d",
      "During a visit in April, Athaydes guided Associated Press journalists through the site, which had many researchers. The area was so remote that most researchers had endured a full-day boat trip from the city of Belem, which will host the next annual U.N. climate talks later this year. During the days in the field, the scientists stayed at the Ferreira Penna Scientific Base of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, a few hundred yards (meters) from the plots.",
      "Four teams were at work. One collected soil samples to measure root growth in the top layer. Another gathered weather data and tracking soil temperature and moisture. A third was measured vegetation moisture and sap flow. The fourt focused on plant physiology.",
      "\"We know very little about how drought influences soil processes,\u201d said ecologist Rachel Selman, researcher at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Nature study, during a break.",
      "Esecaflor's drought simulation draws some parallels with the past two years, when much of the Amazon rainforest, under the influence of El Nino and the impact of climate change, endured its most severe dry spells on record. The devastating consequences ranged from the death of dozens of river dolphins due to warming and receding waters to vast wildfires in old-growth areas.",
      "Rowland explained that the recent El Nino brought short-term, intense impacts to the Amazon, not just through reduced rainfall but also with spikes in temperature and vapor pressure deficit, a measure of how dry the air is. In contrast, the Esecaflor experiment focused only on manipulating soil moisture to study the effects of long-term shifts in rainfall.",
      "\u201cBut in both cases, we\u2019re seeing a loss of the forest\u2019s ability to absorb carbon,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, along with the loss of forest cover.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply",
      "NEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply.",
      "Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can\u2019t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits.",
      "The Associated Press\u2019 CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from the survey:",
      "The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.",
      "CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.",
      "The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.",
      "\u201c2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,\u201d said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.",
      "Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent \u201clong-overdue\u201d increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills.",
      "Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023.",
      "Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted.",
      "Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards.",
      "The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar.",
      "\u201cFor CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,\" said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. \"Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.\u201d",
      "Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is \u201cthat share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.\" But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a \u201cphenomenal rise\u201d in CEO compensation \u201ctracking recent years' market performance,\u201d which has \"widened the pay gap within workplaces.\"",
      "Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla\u2019s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle.",
      "Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30.",
      "At half the companies in AP\u2019s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company\u2019s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018.",
      "The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries.",
      "Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included.",
      "\u201cWith CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,\u201d Anderson said. \"These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value \u2013 they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.\u201d",
      "For the 27 women who made the AP survey \u2014 the highest number dating back to 2014 \u2014 median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts.",
      "The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.",
      "Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million).",
      "Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we\u2019re really not moving the needle significantly,\u201d she said.",
      "Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023.",
      "Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.",

      "A push in Texas to ban children under 18 years old from social media platforms is fading at the state Capitol",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A push in Texas to ban social media accounts for children under 18 faded Thursday after lawmakers did not take a key vote on creating one of the nation's toughest restrictions aimed at keeping minors off platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.",
      "The bill, which already passed the GOP-controlled state House, aims to go further than a Florida social media ban for minors under 14. Australia banned social media accounts for anyone under 16.",
      "But earlier momentum behind the Texas measure slowed at the eleventh hour in the state Senate as lawmakers face a weekend deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has not said publicly whether he supported the proposed ban, which was opposed by tech trade groups and critics who called it it an unconstitutional limit on free speech.",
      "\u201cThis bill was the best way to protect children in this state,\u201d state Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican carrying the measure, said Wednesday.",
      "The legislative session ends Monday. That leaves a narrowing path for the proposal that, if passed, would set up another test of state efforts to set boundaries on how and when children can access social media.",
      "Many tech companies have established a presence in Texas, including X, which is owned by Elon Musk.",
      "Earlier this week, Abbott signed into law a separate measure requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of online app store users, as well as parental consent to download apps and make in-app purchases for users under 18. Utah passed a similar bill earlier this year.",
      "The proposed Texas ban aimed at minors is the latest move in a growing bipartisan push nationwide to address the impacts of social media on the well-being of children. Critics accuse platforms of using addictive functions to lure children onto their site and keep them there, and of not doing enough to curb violent or age-inappropriate content, or online abuse.",
      "Nearly half of American teenagers say they are online \u201cconstantly\u201d despite concerns about the effects of social media and smartphones on their mental health, according to a December 2024 report published by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The American Psychological Association has called on tech companies and lawmakers to protect children\u2019s mental health, arguing that social media platforms are \u201cparticularly risky\u201d to young people who cannot disengage from sites and struggle with impulse control.",
      "States and countries have passed various measures to address the problem, and some have run into legal challenges.",
      "A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah\u2019s first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",

      "All, authorities allege, were victims tied to cryptocurrency-related crimes that have spilled out from behind computer screens and into the real world as the largely unregulated currency surges in value.",
      "While crypto thefts are not new, the use of physical violence is a far more recent trend, said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas in Austin who tracks financial crimes.",
      "\u201cI think this kind of physical violence is a natural manifestation of the emboldened nature of crypto activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that might clearly be outside of social norms in other spaces \u2014 like robbing a bank \u2014 are somehow just part of the game here.\u201d",
      "In the New York case, two American crypto investors \u2014 John Woeltz and William Duplessie \u2014 have been arrested on kidnapping and assault charges in recent days after a 28-year-old Italian man told police they tortured him for weeks to get his Bitcoin password. Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",
      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records. Police stopped the carjacking and arrested six men.",

      "Earlier this year, men in masks attempted to drag the daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO and a founder of the Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium, into a van, but were thwarted by a shopkeeper armed with a fire extinguisher.",
      "And in January, the co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were also kidnapped for ransom from their home in the region of Cher of central France. They also were rescued by police and 10 people were arrested.",

      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

    "summary": "A security guard testified in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs\u2019 sex-trafficking and racketeering trial that the rap mogul paid him $100,000 to bury the video at the heart of the case.",
    "story": [
      "The security guard said Combs promised \"he would take care of me.\"",
      "A hotel security guard on Tuesday told the jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex-trafficking and racketeering trial that the rap mogul paid him $100,000 in an attempt to secure his silence and bury a video that is now the central piece of evidence in the criminal case that threatens to send him to prison for life.",
      "In the video captured in 2016 by security cameras at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles -- and shown to the jury during the testimony of three different witnesses -- Combs is seen kicking and dragging his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. Ventura, a musician who testified as the government's star witness, said she was trying to escape Combs and one of his drug-fueled orgies, called \"freak-offs.\"",
      "\"When I chose to leave, I grabbed what I could and I got out,\" Ventura testified during the second week of the trial. \"Sean followed me into the hallway before the elevators and grabbed me up, threw me on the ground, kicked me, [and] tried to drag me back to the room.\"",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges in the case. His lawyers have said that Combs takes \"full responsibility\" for the domestic violence captured in the video but argue that the rap mogul has not committed the sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and prostitution alleged by federal prosecutors.",
      "Hotel security guard Eddy Garcia testified Tuesday that Combs frantically worked to make sure the CCTV video never saw the light of day, paying $100,000 to obtain what Combs thought was the only copy of the recording.",
      "\"He was concerned this video would get out and it would ruin his career,\" Garcia testified. According to Garcia, Combs promised \"he would take care of me\" and ended up paying $100,000 in cash to the man he later referred to as \"Eddy my angel.\"",
      "When the video was obtained by CNN last year, the condemnation was swift and led to Combs offering a public apology, saying he was \"truly sorry\" for his conduct and that he \"sought professional help\" after the incident.",
      "Prosecutors have argued that Combs' $100,000 payment to Garcia was a bribe and one of the underlying crimes at the heart of their allegation that the hip-hop superstar is guilty of racketeering conspiracy. They allege that Combs realized the episode could reveal years of criminal conduct and might pull back the curtain on how the mogul used his business empire to coerce women into sex, threaten them into silence, and protect his public reputation.",
      "The trial is set to resume Wednesday when three more witnesses are expected to take the stand.",
      "Frank Piazza, a video expert, is expected to be the first witness followed by Bryana Bongolan, who has alleged Combs threatened to kill her by dangling her over a balcony in the presence of Ventura. Bongolan made similar allegations in a civil case, which Combs has denied.",
      "A woman being called \"Jane\" is expected to take the stand on Wednesday afternoon and to testify for as long as five days, according to prosecutors. Jane is expected to be the third and final alleged victim to testify against Combs.",
      "Garcia testified Tuesday that he heard about the assault shortly after he clocked in for his shift at the InterContinental Hotel on March 5, 2016. Garcia told the jury he understood law enforcement was not contacted at the time because Ventura did not request medical or police attention.",
      "About an hour into his shift, Garcia explained to jurors that he got an unexpected call on his work phone from Combs' assistant Kristina Khorram, who requested a copy of the security video. Despite telling her she would need to contact hotel management or get a subpoena to view the footage, Garcia testified Khorram arrived in the hotel lobby an hour later to watch the recording.",
      "\"She was asking about the video and if there was any way she could see it,\" he said. \"She wanted to know what they were dealing with.\"",
      "Garcia said he apologized and said he could not show it to her, though he testified he warned her, \"Off the record: it's bad.\"",
      "That evening, Garcia testified he once again received a call on his personal cell from Khorram. He told the jury within seconds, a noticeably \"nervous\" Combs came on the other end of the line, trying to explain his actions.",
      "\"He asked me if I knew who he was. I said yes,\" Garcia said. \"Mr. Combs sounded very nervous. Just was talking really fast. Was just saying that he had a little too much to drink and that I knew how things was with women when one thing led to another.\"",
      "Garcia testified, \"He stated that I sounded like a good guy, that I sounded like I wanted to help, that something like this could ruin him. He was concerned this video would get out and it would ruin his career.\"",
      "He said he also remembered Combs telling him, \"he would take care of me.\" After Garcia informed Combs that he would accept $100,000 in exchange for the video, Garcia testified that Combs \"sounded excited\" and \"referred to me as 'Eddy my angel.'\"",
      "\"He wanted the video as soon as possible,\" Garcia told the court. He explained he was then given an address about a 20-minute drive from the InterContinental Hotel, where he was to make the trade.",

      "\"When I got passed the phone, I said, 'Hi', she said 'Hi' and she said she had a movie coming out and it wasn't a good time for this to come out and she wanted it to go away,\" Garcia responded.",
      "Garcia told jurors that Combs demanded he sign a nondisclosure agreement, agree to a certification that there was only one copy of the video, and hand over his ID as well as the identifications of his supervisor and coworker. Garcia then testified Combs left the room and returned with a brown bag and a money counter, which Combs fed \"stacks of $10,000 at a time.\"",

Prosecutors have argued that Combs' companies doubled as a criminal enterprise that allowed the rap mogul to commit crimes for years with few repercussions.",
      "Ferguson, who worked as the chief financial officer for Bad Boy Entertainment for 12 years, walked the jury through Combs' bank accounts, financial arrangements, how the businesses managed cash and how employees were reimbursed for expenses charged to their corporate cards.

      "Jurors also saw documents showing a series of wire transfers in 2011 to and from Cassie Ventura's mother. While Ferguson said he did not know the reason for the $20,000 payment, jurors last month heard directly from Regina Ventura, who testified that she and her husband took out a home equity loan to fund the payment. She testified Combs demanded to \"recoup\" money he had spent on Cassie Ventura \"because he was angry that she had a relationship with Scott Mescudi.\" Mescudi is also a well-known rapper, performing under the name Kid Cudi.",

      "The guidance was issued after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade.",
      "The Trump administration announced on Tuesday it is rescinding Biden-era guidance that uses a federal law to require hospitals to stabilize patients in need of emergency care -- including by providing an abortion.",
      "In July 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued guidance that, under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), doctors must perform abortions in emergency departments -- even in states where the procedure is illegal -- particularly if it serves as a \"stabilizing medical treatment\" for an emergency medical condition.",
      "Emergency medical conditions included, but were not limited to, \"ectopic pregnancy, complications of pregnancy loss, or emergent hypertensive disorders, such as preeclampsia with severe features.\"",
      "EMTALA, which was passed in 1986, ensures that emergency patients receive services and treatment regardless of ability to pay. Hospitals that refuse to provide \"necessary stabilizing care\" or \"an appropriate transfer\" can face civil monetary penalties.",
      "The HHS guidance was one of the attempts of the Biden administration to preserve abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, ending federal protections for abortion rights.",
      "However, HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rescinded the guidance, as well as an accompanying letter from former HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, saying they \"do not reflect the policy of this Administration.\"",
      "\"CMS will continue to enforce EMTALA, which protects all individuals who present to a hospital emergency department seeking examination or treatment, including for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy,\" a press release from the agency read.",

      "Abortion rights groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, criticized the administration and accused President Donald Trump of walking back on a campaign promise not to interfere with abortion access.",
      "\"By rescinding this guidance, the Trump administration has sent a clear signal that it is siding not with the majority, but with its anti-abortion allies -- and that will come at the expense of women's lives,\" Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, deputy director of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. \"The ACLU will use every lever we have to keep President Trump and his administration from endangering our health and lives.\"",
      "The Biden administration's guidance has faced legal challenges in the past. In January 2024, a federal appeals court ruled that Texas hospitals and doctors are not required to perform emergency abortions despite the guidance.",
      "Meanwhile, earlier this year, the Department of Justice dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Biden administration against the state of Idaho, claiming its near-total abortion ban violated EMTALA.",

The president may disagree with the Court and some of its rulings, but he will always respect its foundational role.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane season began on Sunday, June 1, and goes through Nov. 30.",
      "Acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Director David Richardson told staff in an all-hands meeting that he was unaware hurricane season had started, according to sources familiar with the meeting.",
      "Hurricane season started on Sunday, June 1, and goes through Nov. 30. It is unclear if Richardson, who has led the agency since mid-May, was joking in the Monday meeting, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson argued he was.",
      "When asked by reporters Tuesday during a White House press briefing whether President Donald Trump is \"still comfortable\" with Richardson following his remarks, press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed concerns and said FEMA is taking hurricane season \"seriously, contrary to some of the reporting we have seen based on jokes that were made and leaks from meetings.\"",
      "Reuters first reported on Richardson's comments.",
      "Richardson's comments follow an internal review indicating FEMA is \"not ready\" for the 2025 hurricane season in mid-May.",
      "The DHS spokesperson denied FEMA is unprepared, saying, \"Despite meanspirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy, there is no uncertainty about what FEMA will be doing this Hurricane Season.\"",
      "\"FEMA is laser-focused on disaster response and protecting the American people,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., slammed Richardson, posting on X that he is \"unaware of why he hasn\u2019t been fired yet.\"",
      "\"Trump's FEMA chief is incompetent,\" Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., added. \"People will die.\"",
      "The meeting was held Monday morning after Richardson had said he would update staff on a plan to tackle hurricane season.",
      "\"It's not a secret that under Secretary Noem and acting Administrator Richardson, FEMA is shifting from bloated, D.C.-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\" the spokesperson added. \"The old processes are being replaced because they failed Americans in real emergencies for decades.\"",
      "However, sources in the meeting said Richardson is sticking with the original plan, made during the Biden administration, in order to avoid getting in the way of FEMA's Review Council, which was established by President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "Dan Stoneking, a former FEMA official and owner of Stoneking Strategic Communications, argued this reveals that the Trump administration believes its best chance at success this hurricane season is relying on the last administration's plan, rather than its own.",
      "Still, Stoneking said the original plan was created with more funding and before thousands of employees departed FEMA since the Trump administration took over, which he said would \"clearly necessitate changes in planning in order to be successful.\"",
      "\"This is not laser-focused. This is not empowering,\" he said. \"It is nothing more than a preamble to a less efficient federal response that this administration has caused but will still erroneously and egregiously blame on their predecessors.\"",
      "\"You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time,\" he added.",
      "Leavitt denied that the United States is ill-prepared to handle disasters, saying, \"The president will deeply and thoughtfully consider any requests for federal aid that come to his desk.\"",

      "Michael Boren has a history of conflicts with the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "President Donald Trump's nominee to oversee the U.S. Forest Service has a history of clashing with the very agency that he soon could be leading.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry began the confirmation hearing for Michael Boren, an investment consultant, Idaho ranch owner and founder of a billion-dollar tech company. A bipartisan committee will assess Boren's qualifications and vote on his nomination.",
      "Boren, 62, has had disagreements with the U.S. Forest Service in recent years. One recent conflict involves building a cabin and clearing land within the Sawtooth National Forest near Stanley, Idaho, E&E News reported, citing agency correspondence and individuals familiar with the situation.",
      "He co-founded Boise-based tech company Clearwater Analytics and owns a 480-acre ranch, some of it within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, according to the Idaho Mountain Express. The work on the property began before Boren was nominated, but the matter has not yet been resolved, according to the publication.",
      "The dispute over the cabin is with Galena Mines, an LLC associated with Boren. He was listed as manager until February of this year, before he was removed.",
      "Other disputes include diverting a stream, disputes over how Boren manages land within and around the national forest and disagreements about the precise locations of mining claims made by Boren's corporation, according to E&E News.",
      "A small airstrip on Boren's ranch also stirred uproar among neighbors who claim he was using it to land small planes before he was granted a conditional-use permit from the Forest Service, according to the report.",
      "Attorney Thomas Balducci, who represented Boren for the 2023 lawsuit regarding the airstrip, declined to provide a comment to ABC News.",
      "Boren's brother, David Boren, has also clashed with the Forest Service over a trail the agency built near his ranch.",
      "When introducing Boren to the committee, Sen. James Risch, R-Ida., addressed the reports of the disputes between the nominee and the Forest Service, saying that people who own \"inholding\" land -- or privately owned land situated within the boundary of publicly owned or protected area that are common west of the Mississippi River -- typically come into conflict with the federal government.",
      "\"Usually, the BLM (Bureau of Land Management) and the Forest Service aren\u2019t happy with the inholdings,\" Risch said.",
      "Boren said he feels some of the disagreements with the federal government over his inholdings have been \"oppressive,\" accusing the Forest Service of being \"aggressive\" at some points, but conceding that all parties were able to come to resolutions after initial disputes.",
      "If confirmed as the undersecretary of Natural Resources and Environment, Boren would be responsible for day-to-day operations at the U.S. Forest Service, which manages about 200 million acres of public land. Boren would report to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins.",
      "Boren, a lifelong rancher, has been involved with the Forest Service since he was a child, he told the committee. His father once worked for the agency, and he and his brother spent a summer planting trees for the service, he said.",
      "Boren said he is committed to making forest management more resilient and healthy.",
      "\"I feel that I\u2019m uniquely positioned to support the Forest Service in its role,\" he said, adding that it would be a \"blessing\" to work for the Forest Service, if confirmed.",

      "A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss scheduling details, confirmed that Hegseth also will not participate by video conference.",
      "It is the latest in a series of steps that the U.S. has taken to distance itself from the Ukraine war effort.

      "France and other NATO nations are concerned that the U.S. is considering withdrawing troops from Europe to shift them to the Indo-Pacific. Macron said abandoning Ukraine would eventually erode U.S. credibility in deterring any potential conflict with China over Taiwan.",
      "Hegseth's predecessor, Lloyd Austin, created the group after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Since then, more than 50 member nations have collectively provided Ukraine with some $126 billion in weapons and military assistance, including over $66.5 billion from the U.S.",

      "During his first meeting with the group and a subsequent NATO defense ministers gathering in Brussels in February, Hegseth warned that Ukraine should abandon its NATO bid and its push to reclaim all Russian-occupied territory.

      "Paul opposes the bill because of a debt ceiling increase in it that he said would \"explode deficits.\" Paul said at an event in Iowa last week that the cuts in the bill are \"wimpy and anemic\" and called for slashes to other entitlements, which Trump has made clear are a red line for him.",
      "\"Rand Paul has very little understanding of the BBB, especially the tremendous GROWTH that is coming. He loves voting 'NO' on everything, he thinks it's good politics, but it's not,\" Trump said in a post on his conservative social media platform Tuesday morning.",

The legislation extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boost spending for the military and border security -- while making some cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other assistance programs. It will also add about $3.8 trillion to the federal government's $36.2 trillion in debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).",
      "Trump met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune at the White House on Monday, according to a White House official. The meeting comes as Thune faces the Herculean task of moving this House-backed bill through the Senate as expeditiously as possible.",
      "Thune has so far not made clear what his strategy will be for moving this package through the upper chamber. But as things currently stand, Thune can only afford to lose three of his GOP members to pass the package, and right now, he has more members than that expressing serious doubts about the bill.",
      "The president's outreach so far has targeted a number of senators who have publicly expressed a need to see substantive changes to the House-backed bill.",
      "Paul told ABC News that he had a \"lengthy discussion\" with Trump this week where the president \"did most of the talking.\" Asked if Trump convinced him to change his mind, Paul quipped: \"no.\"",
      "Trump also met with Republican Sen. Rick Scott on Monday to discuss the bill, sources confirmed to ABC News. Scott is among a group of Senate hardliners who wants to see larger cuts to government spending in this bill.",
      "Republican Sen. Ron Johnson -- who also received a call from Trump on Monday, according to the White House -- has also been vocal about his concerns that the bill doesn't go nearly far enough to slash federal spending.",
      "But anyone wishing to change the bill will have to balance the desire for spending cuts from hardliners against the calls from others in the conference who are insisting there be no cuts to Medicaid. Changes to Medicaid are one of the key ways the House bill slashes spending levels.",
      "Trump seems to be targeting this part of the GOP conference as well, speaking with Republican Sen. Josh Hawley by phone, a White House official confirmed. Hawley, who has said he opposes potential cuts to Medicaid benefits, said in a post on X after that call, that Trump \"said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS.\"",
      "Trump put pressure on Republican senators to fall in line in a post on his social media site on Monday night, emphasizing that he wants the GOP tax megabill on his desk before the Fourth of July holiday.",

      "A 4-year-old Mexican girl who receives lifesaving medical care from a Southern California hospital has been granted permission to remain in the country",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A 4-year-old Mexican girl who receives lifesaving medical care from a Southern California hospital was granted permission to remain in the country weeks after federal authorities said she could be deported, her family's attorneys said Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security granted the girl and her mother humanitarian parole for one year so she can continue to receive treatment she has been getting since arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2023, according to a copy of a letter received by Rebecca Brown, an attorney for the family from the nonprofit Public Counsel.",
      "An email message was sent to the Department of Homeland Security seeking comment.",
      "The girl\u2019s family said they were notified in April and May that their humanitarian parole was being revoked and they would be subject to potential deportation.",
      "The Trump administration has been pushing to dismantle policies from former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that granted temporary legal status for certain migrants and allowed them to live legally in the U.S., generally for two years.",
      "The girl was taken to a hospital upon arriving on at the U.S.-Mexico border with her mother in 2023 and released once she was stable enough. She receives intravenous nutrition through a special backpack for short bowel syndrome, which prevents her from being able to take in and process nutrients on her own, and lawyers said the treatment she receives is necessary at this stage for her to survive and isn't available in Mexico.",
      "The family's attorneys from Public Counsel said in a statement that while they were grateful the administration \u201cacted swiftly\u201d to ensure the girl could continue her life-saving treatment, they hoped the case highlighted the need for better communication with federal immigration officials.",
      "\u201cWe cannot ignore the systemic challenges that brought Sofia to the brink,\u201d the attorneys said, using a pseudonym for the girl. \u201cHer parole was terminated without warning ... It took an international outcry and pressure from elected officials to get a response\u2014something that used to take a single phone call.\u201d",
      "Humanitarian parole, which doesn\u2019t put migrants on a path to U.S. citizenship, was widely used during the Biden administration to alleviate pressure on the U.S.-Mexico southern border. It was previously used on a case-by-case basis to address individual emergencies and also for people fleeing humanitarian crises around the world including Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos during the late 1970s.",
      "In Mexico, the girl was largely confined to a hospital because of her medical condition, said her mother, Deysi Vargas. After joining a program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, she can now receive treatment at home in Bakersfield, California, and go to the park and store like other children, Vargas has said.",
      "Lawyers said the girl's medical treatment, which requires 14 hours a day of intravenous nutrition, will not be necessary indefinitely but that she is not at the point where she could live without it.",

      "A man in central Washington state is wanted on suspicion of murder after his three young daughters were reported missing and then found dead.",
      "Authorities asked the public Tuesday for help finding Travis Decker, 32, who is wanted for three counts of murder and kidnapping, according to police in Wenatchee, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Seattle.",
      "Police said it was unknown whether Decker, a former Army soldier with \u201cextensive training,\u201d was armed.",
      "On Friday the mother of the girls, ages 9, 8 and 5, reported that their father did not return them after a planned visit, police said.",
      "Over the weekend authorities looked for the children and for Decker, who was believed to be living out of a white 2017 GMC Sierra pickup with Washington plates.",
      "Police said Decker's unoccupied truck was found Monday near a campground west of the city of Leavenworth, which is about 20 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of Wenatchee. Officers found the girls' bodies during a search.",
      "Anyone who may have seen Decker since Friday or knows his current location was asked to call 911.",
      "\u201cDue to safety concerns do not attempt to contact or approach Decker,\u201d police said.",
      "The Wenatchee School District said the girls were students of Lincoln Elementary. Counseling services were available, and the district asked people to respect the privacy of students, staff members and families and come to the campus only for regular school business.",
      "The mother told police that Decker picked the girls up around 5 p.m. but had not returned them by 8 p.m., and his phone went straight to voicemail, according to a probable cause affidavit written by a Wenatchee police detective, The Seattle Times reported.",
      "The detective said she \u201cexpressed concern because Decker reportedly has never done this before and \u2026 is currently experiencing some mental health issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat prompted her to call us was that ... he was late returning the girls and had not communicated to her that he was going to be late, which was his typical fashion and so this was out of the ordinary,\u201d Capt. Brian Chance said.",
      "Washington State Patrol was contacted Friday night to request an Amber Alert, but it did not meet the required criteria, Wenatchee police said. The following day Wanatchee detectives contacted the patrol with additional information that led to the issuance of an Endangered Missing Person Alert.",
      "The lacking criteria was suspected abduction and imminent peril of death or serious injury, said Chris Loftis, director of public affairs for the state patrol.",
      "\u201cIn this case, it was a parent with custodial privileges, and the children had not been returned home on time. But that\u2019s a rather common occurrence and not something where you just automatically assume abduction,\u201d he said, adding that there was no indication Decker, a custodial parent who had the children for a visit, would harm them.",
      "\"We\u2019re people too, you know, so the loss of a child, the loss of two children, the loss of three children is ... devastating,\" Loftis said. \u201cEverybody always looks to how we can improve.\u201d",
      "The alert systems are constantly evolving and this could prompt further change, Loftis said: \u201cObviously it didn\u2019t work this time. Obviously we have three children that are dead.\u201d",
      "Decker and the girls' mother are divorced, Chance said. He did not have details on how the girls were killed or on Decker's employment.",
      "Decker joined the Army in 2013 and transferred to the Washington National Guard in 2021, Washington Military Department spokesperson Karina Shagren told The Associated Press. He was a full-time member of the Guard until 2023 or 2024, when he switched to part-time.",
      "Decker stopped attending mandatory monthly drills a little over a year ago, and the Guard was in the process of a disciplinary discharge for him, Shagren said.",
      "\u201cThis is an absolute tragedy,\u201d Shagren said. \u201cWe are mourning along with the community.\u201d",
      "The Chelan County Sheriff's Office, which found the truck, was leading the search in the Okanogan Wenatchee National Forest area while other teams followed up on \u201cpotential credible information and tips\u201d regarding Decker's location, the agency said in a statement.",
      "The agency was working with U.S. Marshals to locate and apprehend Decker. A reward of up to $20,000 was available for information leading directly to his arrest.",

The 56-year-old woman was sewing in her home in Waterbury, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Hartford, when a bullet flew through a wall and hit her in the head.",
      "Martinez Antongiorgi\u2019s daughter, Yarimar Mercado Martinez, competed for the family's native Puerto Rico in rifle shooting at the Olympics in 2016, 2021 and 2024. She was in Brazil for another competition when her mother was killed.",
      "Greene pleaded guilty to murder in February. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment after Tuesday's sentencing in Waterbury Superior Court.",
      "According to court testimony, the fatal shooting stemmed from a dispute that one of the suspects, Franklin Robinson, had with a man who said hello to his girlfriend. Robinson, Greene and another man shot up a car parked on Martinez Antongiorgi\u2019s street, thinking the man was inside it. A bullet went into Martinez Antongiorgi\u2019s home. Another bystander was wounded but survived.",
      "A jury convicted Robinson of murder and other charges in 2023 and he was later sentenced to 90 years in prison.",
      "The third suspect, Levi Brock, has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges in the case, including murder, and awaits trial.",

At the time of her death, they had set a date to renew their wedding vows, their daughter wrote at the time.",

      "\u201cAs the session concludes, I\u2019m proud to report that we\u2019ve made significant progress in our two most critical endeavors this session: combatting the rising cost of housing and improving outcomes in our K-12 education system,\u201d Lombardo said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at some of the notable bills that passed and failed during this year's 120-day session in Carson City.",
      "\u2014 Voter ID and ballot boxes: Signaling a major compromise, lawmakers passed a bill on the final day of the session that revived Democrats' vetoed effort to add more mail ballot drop boxes around the state ahead of an election in exchange for new voter ID requirements that Lombardo supports.",
      "It marks a significant shift for Nevada Democrats, who have long opposed GOP-led efforts to require photo identification from voters at the polls and comes on the heels of voters in November passing a voter ID ballot measure. It would have to pass again in 2026 in order to amend the state constitution.",
      "\u2014 Primary elections for nonpartisan voters: A week before the session ended, Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager introduced a bill as an emergency request that would allow nonpartisan voters to cast a ballot in Republican or Democratic primary elections, excluding presidential primaries. Voters registered as nonpartisan outnumber both major parties in the swing state.",
      "The bill is different from the effort voters rejected in November that would have implemented open primaries and ranked choice voting for all voters.",
      "\u2014 Teacher raises: Lawmakers in both chambers overwhelmingly approved a bill that includes pay raises for teachers at charters schools. Lombardo had said he would not approve the state's education budget if it left out raises for charter school teachers, which Yeager then added to the bill.",
      "\u2014 Police use of force in schools: The proposal approved by lawmakers would require the Clark County School District\u2019s police department to make public its data on officer use of force, including the use of stun guns, batons and pepper spray. The school district is the fifth-largest in the nation and has its own police department.",
      "\u2014 \u201cAttainable\u201d housing: Lombardo's bill aimed at expanding affordable housing, one of his top priorities this session, would allocate $133 million in state funds for housing projects for what he calls the \u201cmissing middle\" who can't afford to buy a home but don't currently qualify for affordable housing. It passed.",
      "\u2014 Renter protections: A handful of bills aimed at expanding protections for renters passed on party lines. They include a proposal that would create a pilot program capping rent prices for seniors for a year, and another that would allow tenants to quickly file legal complaints against landlords for unsafe living conditions like broken air conditioning or broken locks.",
      "\u2014 Lombardo's crime bill: The governor, who was a longtime police officer and the former elected sheriff in Las Vegas, had vowed ahead of the session to crack down on crime. But his crime bill failed after last-minute changes were added and lawmakers ran out of time Monday night.",
      "It would have created stiffer penalties for certain crimes, including \u201csmash-and-grab\u201d retail thefts and violent crimes against hospitality workers, a newly designated protected class under the proposal.",
      "\u2014 Film tax credits: The closely watched bill backed by Sony Pictures and Warner Bros. Entertainment failed. It would have given massive tax credits aimed at bringing film production to southern Nevada, including a 31-acre film studio in an affluent neighborhood west of the Las Vegas Strip. A similar bill failed in 2023.",
      "\u2014 Defining antisemitism: Lawmakers approved a bill that creates a definition of antisemitism for state-led investigations into discrimination in housing, employment and other accommodations. It passed, but sparked a debate because some thought the definition was too broad and could limit free speech criticizing Israel.",
      "\u2014 State lottery: The proposal, backed by the powerful Culinary Workers Union that represents 60,000 hotel and casino workers, would have ended Nevada's longstanding ban on lotteries. It failed after the Legislature's first major deadline in April.",

      "The bandleader\u2019s childhood family home marks the latest step in the State Historical Society of North Dakota\u2019s nearly completed goal of installing flush toilets at its dozen most popular, staffed sites. The most recent success, with the final three planned to be completed soon, came before the unveiling of a statue of Welk at a site that draws fans who recall \u201cThe Lawrence Welk Show,\u201d which ran on TV for decades starting in the 1950s.",
      "The North Dakota group's goal of replacing pit toilets with flush units may seem like a humble aspiration to some, but it's an important milestone, said Chris Dorfschmidt, a historic sites manager.",
      "\u201cA lot of our sites are kind of in the middle of nowhere. As I like to put it, history didn't happen where it's convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of that, if you've driven all the way out there, and that's the best we can do to kind of accommodate you, it's not the most pleasant experience.\u201d",
      "North Dakota has 60 state historic sites \u2014 everything from museums and an underground nuclear launch facility to plaques mounted on boulders in fields.",
      "\u201cAll of our sites, they really do help share a story of us as a state,\u201d Dorfschmidt said.",
      "Two other facilities are slated to be finished by June 30: at Whitestone Hill, the site of a deadly 1863 attack by U.S. troops against Native Americans; and Fort Buford, a military fort near the Missouri-Yellowstone river confluence.",
      "The Historical Society also is eyeing the Chateau de Mores for flush toilets. The wealthy Marquis de Mores built the 26-room home in 1883 near Medora, a present-day tourist town in the state's scenic Badlands where a young President Theodore Roosevelt once roamed.",
      "Less-visited sites that aren't staffed likely won't receive a restroom upgrade, which costs about $150,000 each.",
      "At the Welk Homestead, about 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) southeast of Bismarck, workers matched the color scheme of the restroom to the house and farm buildings, including interior colors.",
      "\u201cWe made it to fit into the site and harmonize with the site and just be a pleasant part of the experience,\u201d Historic Sites Manager Rob Hanna said.",

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the arrest, saying he had written a letter threatening to kill Trump and would \u201cself-deport\u201d to Mexico. The announcement, which also was posted by the White House on its social media accounts, contained an image of the letter as well as a photo of Morales Reyes.",

      "The president, who has golf clubs around the state and frequently stays at his Bedminster property, announced his endorsement for Ciattarelli last month.",
      "On Monday, Trump held a telephone rally for the candidate, a former state lawmaker who transformed from a critic to vocal backer of the president. The phone call lasted about 10 minutes, with the president saying that voters will decide whether New Jersey remains a \u201chigh-tax, high-crime sanctuary state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew Jersey is ready to pop out of that blue horror show and really get in there and vote for somebody that\u2019s going to make things happen,\u201d the president said.",
      "Trump's call for early voting echoed the pitch he made to voters in the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Ciattarelli said his first executive order if elected would be to end any sanctuary policies for immigrants in the country illegally. Currently, the state attorney general has directed local law enforcement not to assist federal agents in civil immigration matters.",
      "There is no legal definition for sanctuary city policies, but they generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.",
      "Ciattarelli also said the attorney general he appoints if he wins won't be bringing lawsuits against the White House.

      "Ciattarelli is running against former radio talk host Bill Spadea, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac and a southern New Jersey contractor named Justin Barbera.",
      "Early in-person voting begins Tuesday and goes through Sunday. Primary day is June 10, though voters have been sending mail-in ballots in since late April.",
      "Though the primary isn't over, Ciattarelli hinted at what attacks against his eventual Democratic challenger in the general election might be, saying the party's eight years in the governorship and more than two decades of power in the legislature have been a failure.",
      "The Democratic field isn't set. There's a six-way contest between Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill; Mayors Ras Baraka of Newark and Steven Fulop of Jersey City; former state Senate President Steve Sweeney; and teacher's union president Sean Spiller.",
      "New Jersey tilts Democratic in presidential and Senate elections in particular, and the party has a roughly 800,000 voter registration advantage over Republicans.

      "President Donald Trump has appeared to undercut a proposal that was offered by his special envoy to Iran",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday appeared to undercut a proposal that was offered by his special envoy to Iran, saying he will insist that Tehran fully dismantle its nuclear enrichment program as part of any deal to ease crushing sanctions.",
      "Trump and Steve Witkoff, who is leading the negotiations for the U.S., have repeatedly offered inconsistent public messages about whether Iran would be allowed to retain the capacity to enrich uranium to lower levels for civilian purposes. The Trump administration maintains that it will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "The negotiations have been framed by Trump as both countries\u2019 best chance to avoid direct military conflict over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Tehran, which denies seeking a nuclear weapon, has insisted that it will not agree to any deal that fully scraps its enrichment program.",
      "\u201cUnder our potential Agreement \u2014 WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",
      "Addressing the seeming contradiction, a White House official said Trump was speaking the \u201ccold, hard truth.\u201d The official said the terms the U.S. gave the Iranians were \u201cvery tough\u201d and would make it impossible for them to obtain a nuclear bomb.",
      "Trump\u2019s post comes after media reports that Witkoff\u2019s latest proposal to Tehran would allow Iran to retain low levels of enrichment for civilian uses like nuclear medicine and commercial power if it agrees to shut down its heavily protected underground sites for a period of time. The U.S. and Iran have engaged in several rounds of direct nuclear talks for the first time in years.",
      "Senior officials \u2014 including Witkoff and Trump himself \u2014 have said within the last few weeks that Iran would not be able to keep enriching uranium at any level.",
      "The proposal, reported by Axios and confirmed by a U.S. official, called for the creation of a regional consortium to handle uranium enrichment for civilian uses \u2014 a plan first studied more than a decade ago in negotiations that led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.",
      "Trump was sharply critical of that agreement \u2014 which also allowed set limits on uranium enrichment but permitted Iran to maintain such a capacity \u2014 and withdrew the U.S. from it in 2017 during his first term.",
      "The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency found that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels since its last update in February, according to a confidential report released by the U.N. nuclear watchdog on Saturday.",
      "Iran has maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but Iranian officials have increasingly suggested that Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement before Trump's post. \"Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it\u2019s in their best interest to accept it. Out of respect for the ongoing deal, the Administration will not comment on details of the proposal to the media.\u201d",
      "The proposal that Trump appeared to undercut on Monday evening included significant concessions by the administration certain to anger Israel along with pro-Israel lawmakers in the United States.",
      "Several of the main points were essentially the same or very similar to conditions outlined in the 2015 nuclear deal.",
      "Early iterations of that agreement negotiated by the Obama administration also suggested the possibility of a regional consortium that would put Iranian uranium enrichment above a certain level under the control of Iran and its neighbors. The idea was scrapped, however, because of Gulf Arab nations\u2019 objections and Iranian suspicions of the ultimate aims of the consortium.",
      "People who were involved in the 18-month negotiations for the 2015 deal reacted immediately to reports that the Trump administration might allow Iran to continue with an enrichment program at any level, particularly after senior officials repeatedly said Iran would not be able to retain such programs.",
      "\u201cThis proposal poses a moment of truth for critics of previous Iran nuclear negotiations/agreements (and) those who have called for a no-enrichment, full-dismantlement deal,\u201d Dan Shapiro, Obama\u2019s former ambassador to Israel, wrote on X. \u201cWill they hold Trump to the same standard?\u201d",

      "BOSTON -- The head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Monday defended his tactics against criticism that authorities are being too heavy-handed as they ramp up arrests toward President Donald Trump's promises of mass deportations.",
      "San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said he was \u201cdeeply upset\u201d by an ICE operation at a popular Italian restaurant just before the dinner rush on Friday. A chaotic showdown unfolded outside as customers and witnesses shouted, smoke filled the air, and agents wore heavy tactical gear to face an angry crowd.",
      "Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, turned emotional when asked to explain why officials wear masks. He said some have received death threats and been harassed online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I\u2019m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, their family on the line because people don\u2019t like what immigration enforcement is,\u201d he said at a news conference in Boston to announce nearly 1,500 arrests in the region as part of a month-long \u201csurge operation.\u201d",

      "Lyons may have been referring to comments by San Diego Councilman Sean Elo-Rivera, who called ICE officers \u201cterrorists\u201d after Friday's restaurant raid. \u201cThis isn't safety. It's state-sponsored terrorism,\" Elo-Rivera wrote on Instagram.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security reposted Elo-Rivera's message, saying that likening ICE to terrorists was \u201csickening.\u201d The councilman stuck by his comments on Monday.",
      "Other elected officials, such as Gloria and U.S. Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego, both Democrats, were more muted but also sharply critical of ICE and the Republican White House.",
      "\u201cFederal actions like these are billed as a public safety measure, but it had the complete opposite effect. What we saw undermines trust and creates fear in our community,\u201d Gloria said.",
      "ICE said Monday that the operation at Buona Forchetta, an anchor of San Diego's trendy South Park neighborhood, resulted in four arrests of people in the U.S. illegally. Authorities executed criminal search warrants for illegal hiring and making false statements when the crowd \u201cbecame unruly,\u201d prompting them to use flash-bang devices.",
      "\u201cWhen gatherings like these are formed, it not only places law enforcement in danger but also the demonstrators/onlookers attempting to impede law enforcement activity,\u201d ICE said in a statement.",
      "The owners said they were closing their restaurants in Southern California for two days.",
      "\u201cWe wish we could find stronger words, but the truth is we are heartbroken,\u201d the owners said in a statement. \u201cThe traumatic incident involving a federal enforcement operation at our original and beloved South Park location has left a mark on all of us. A wound that is still raw, still echoing in our kitchens, our dining rooms, and our hearts.\u201d",
      "Lyons said in an interview on Fox & Friends Sunday that ICE was averaging about 1,600 arrests a day, a sharp increase from previous data that showed 78,155 arrests between Jan. 20 and May 19 \u2014 a daily average of 656. He said ICE can and will do more.",
      "Stephen Miller, the key architect of Trump's immigration policy, last week set a goal of 3,000 arrests a day and said the number could go higher.

      "Three women are suing Baltimore\u2019s public school system, alleging they were sexually abused by a special education teacher decades ago",
      "BALTIMORE -- Three women are suing Baltimore\u2019s public school system, alleging they were sexually abused by a special education teacher decades ago while administrators failed to protect students from his predatory behavior.",
      "One of the plaintiffs was 14 when she alleges the teacher, whom the lawsuit names as Alvin Hunt, raped and impregnated her, according to the complaint.",
      "At a news conference Monday morning, attorneys for the women said school officials knew about the abuse and allowed it to continue. They said Hunt would lure students to his house under the pretense of after-school tutoring. The allegations contained in the lawsuits occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s.",
      "Attempts to reach Hunt were unsuccessful. A message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Baltimore City Public Schools.",
      "The lawsuits add to a growing pile of child sexual abuse claims filed in Maryland since the state eliminated its statute of limitations for such cases. Lawmakers approved the Child Victims Act in 2023 with abuse findings against the Catholic Church in mind, but its impacts have extended well beyond religious institutions. The state\u2019s juvenile justice system in particular is facing widespread reckoning after thousands of victims came forward.",
      "Pamela Coleman said she gave birth to Hunt\u2019s daughter after he drugged and raped her. Hunt offered the teen a ride home from school and gave her a cigarette laced with an illicit substance that caused her to lose consciousness, her complaint says.",
      "\u201cMy childhood and teen years was just ripped from me,\u201d Coleman said at the news conference. She said her mother reported the abuse and administrators transferred her to another school after learning she was pregnant.",
      "The AP doesn\u2019t typically identify victims of abuse unless they want to be named.",
      "Attorneys said Hunt, who was also a sports coach, never faced prosecution or accountability for his actions. Instead, he retired from the school system after a long career. He is not named as a defendant in the lawsuits, which were filed against the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners.",
      "\u201cThis abuse was not just known, it was normalized,\u201d said attorney Janai Woodhouse with the Baltimore law firm Murphy, Falcon & Murphy. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t hidden. It was tolerated.\u201d",
      "She said the Child Victims Act allows abuse survivors the time they need to come forward, often decades later. Before its passage, victims couldn\u2019t sue after they turned 38.",
      "The three plaintiffs were young and vulnerable when they were abused by someone they trusted, their attorneys said.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the amount of psychological trauma that was inflicted here. So it took some time,\u201d Woodhouse said. \u201cBut they gathered the courage to come to us and they\u2019re ready to seek justice now.\u201d",
      "According to the lawsuit filed on behalf of Collette Lee, she went to Hunt\u2019s house for tutoring with another special education student. He cornered her and tried to assault her, but she says she managed to escape.",
      "\u201cI was able to run,\u201d she said during the news conference. \u201cI\u2019ve been running for a long time. I\u2019m tired. I want justice.\u201d",
      "The lawsuits were filed Friday in state court. The plaintiffs are seeking punitive damages.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The U.S. Department of Energy has ordered another power plant, this time an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania, to keep its turbines running through the hottest summer months as a precaution against electricity shortfalls in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "The department's order to the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, regarding the Eddystone power plant just south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River, is the department's second use of federal power under President Donald Trump to require a power plant to keep operating on the mainland United States.",
      "Constellation Energy had planned to shut down Eddystone's units 3 and 4 on Saturday, but Trump's Department of Energy ordered the company to continue operating the units until at least Aug. 28. The units can produce a combined 760 megawatts.",
      "The department, in its order, cited PJM's growing concerns about power shortfalls amid the shutdown of aging power plants and rising electricity demand.",
      "PJM last year approved Constellation's request to shut down the units, but it welcomed the department's order to keep them operating, saying it's a \u201cprudent, term-limited step\u201d that allows PJM, the department and Constellation to study the longer-term need and viability of Eddystone's units.",
      "The department took a similar step last week, ordering Consumers Energy to keep the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant open in Michigan past its Saturday retirement.",
      "The grid operator there, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, said the order was unnecessary, that there was no energy emergency there and that there should be enough energy in the region through the summer.",
      "An environmental advocacy group, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, criticized the move to keep Eddystone operating as an \"environmental injustice.\" Shutting down the units would reduce hazardous pollution and carbon emissions from the decades-old facility and help the region meet federal clean air standards for smog, it said.",

      "Shavuot (pronounced Shah-voo-OTE), Hebrew for \u201cweeks,\" has been observed since biblical times. It marks the passing of seven weeks (49 days) from the holiday of Passover, with Shavuot falling on the 50th day.",
      "In biblical times, Shavuot was an agricultural festival, when Israelites would bring harvest offerings to the temple.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A split Supreme Court on Monday rejected a pair of gun rights cases, though one conservative justice predicted the court would soon consider whether assault weapons bans are constitutional.",
      "The majority did not explain its reasoning in turning down the cases over high-capacity magazines and state bans on guns like the AR-15, popular weapons that have also been used in mass shootings.",
      "But three conservative justices on the nine-member court publicly noted their disagreement, and a fourth said he is skeptical that assault-weapons bans are constitutional.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have taken a case challenging Maryland's ban, and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to say the law likely runs afoul of the Second Amendment.",
      "\u201cI would not wait to decide whether the government can ban the most popular rifle in America,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cThat question is of critical importance to tens of millions of law-abiding AR\u201315 owners throughout the country.\u201d",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the decision to pass on the case now but indicated that he is skeptical such bans are constitutional and that he expects the court will address the issue \u201cin the next term or two.\u201d",
      "The Maryland law was passed after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults. The shooter was armed with an AR-15, one of the firearms commonly referred to as an assault weapon.",
      "Several states have similar measures, and congressional Democrats have also supported the concept. The challengers had argued that people have a constitutional right to own the firearms like the AR-15, which most gun owners use legally.",
      "The case comes nearly three years after the high court handed down a landmark ruling that expanded Second Amendment rights and spawned challenges to firearm laws around the country.",
      "Ten states and the District of Columbia have similar laws, covering major cities like New York and Los Angeles. Congress allowed a national assault weapons ban to expire in 2004.",
      "The gun control group Everytown Law applauded the high court's action, saying the measures make communities safer. \u201cWe will fight to ensure the courts continue to uphold these life-saving laws,\u201d said Janet Carter, managing director of Second Amendment litigation.",
      "More than twice as many people died in mass shootings in which large-capacity magazines and assault weapons were used between 2015 and 2022, the group said.",
      "Attorneys for Maryland argued the guns aren\u2019t protected by the Constitution because they\u2019re similar to military-grade weapons. The law bans dozens of firearms \u2014 including the AR-15, the AK-47 and the Barrett .50-caliber sniper rifle \u2014 and puts a 10-round limit on gun magazines.",
      "The gun rights group Second Amendment Foundation said it has seven other cases challenging the bans and plans to continue to \u201caggressively litigate\u201d them. \u201cMillions of Americans continue to be disenfranchised from exercising their complete Second Amendment rights by virtue of these categorical bans,\u201d Executive Director Adam Kraut said.",
      "The high court also rebuffed a bid to overturn state bans on high-capacity gun magazines in a case out of Rhode Island. Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch said they would have heard the case. More than a dozen states have similar laws limiting the amount of ammunition a magazine can hold.",
      "Thomas and Kavanaugh have previously expressed skepticism about assault weapon bans.",
      "As an appeals court judge in 2011, Kavanaugh wrote a dissent saying that a similar measure in Washington, D.C., was unconstitutional. Thomas, meanwhile, dissented in 2015 when the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to a municipal ban on AR-15-style weapons, writing that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of people who owned the weapons used them for lawful purposes like self-defense.",
      "The high court in 2022 handed down a ruling that expanded gun rights and told lower-court judges they should no longer consider factors like public safety in deciding whether firearm laws are constitutional. Instead, they should focus on whether a law fits into the nation\u2019s historic tradition of gun ownership, the court said.",
      "That led to a flurry of challenges to gun laws around the country, multiple restrictions struck down, and confusion among lower-court judges over what gun laws can stay on the books.",
      "Since then, the Supreme Court has overturned a ban on rapid-fire gun accessories called bump stocks but upheld a law barring people under domestic-violence restraining orders from having guns and regulations on nearly untraceable ghost guns.",

      "Williams was traveling by bus from Portland to Deschutes County when he got off in Salem on Saturday, according to Salem Police Violent Crimes Unit detectives. He visited the shelter on Saturday but didn't stay overnight, shelter officials said. The next night, Williams arrived at the shelter shortly before the call for police assistance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in disbelief that something like this could happen. We are most concerned with those who are still in hospital and for those who were just there. It\u2019s a difficult thing to process,\u201d Salem Mayor Julie Hoy said.",

      "Up to 150 men seek refuge at the shelter each night, according to its website.",
      "Caleb Rennie, 19, was driving that stretch of road as he does every day and saw the arrest in progress so started recording it with his cellphone.",

      "Murphy has stalled efforts to carry out deportations of migrants who can\u2019t be returned to their home countries, Sauer wrote. Finding countries willing to take them is \u201ca delicate diplomatic endeavor\u201d and the court requirements are a major setback, he said.",
      "Lawyers for the deported men have until Wednesday to respond.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency, overseen by billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk until his departure on Friday, is resisting a lawsuit calling for it to publicly disclose information about its operations.",
      "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington argues in a lawsuit that DOGE, which has been central to Trump\u2019s push to remake the government, is a federal agency and must be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "CREW claims that DOGE \u201cwields shockingly broad power\u201d with no transparency about its actions. The administration says DOGE is just a presidential advisory body that is exempt from FOIA disclosures.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper had found that its role is likely more than just advisory, especially in helping to shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development and cut billions of dollars in government contracts.",
      "The administration appealed Cooper's orders requiring documents be turned over and acting Administrator Amy Gleason to answer questions under oath.",
      "Last week, Chief Justice John Roberts agreed to temporarily pause the orders pending additional word from the Supreme Court.",
      "Social Security has personal data on nearly everyone in the country, including school records, bank details, salary information and medical and mental health records for disability recipients, according to court documents.",
      "The Trump administration says DOGE needs access to Social Security's systems as part of its mission to target waste in the federal government.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in Maryland restricted the team\u2019s access to Social Security under federal privacy laws, saying DOGE's efforts at the agency amounted to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d based on \u201clittle more than suspicion\u201d of fraud.",
      "The judge is disrupting DOGE's work and interfering with decisions that belong to the executive branch, not courts, Sauer wrote in asking the high court to block Hollander's order in the suit filed by labor unions and retirees.",
      "The justices could act anytime.",
      "Several judges quickly blocked an executive order Trump signed his first day in office that would deny citizenship to children who are born to people who are in the country illegally or temporarily.",
      "The administration appealed three court orders that prohibit the changes from taking effect anywhere in the country.",
      "Earlier in May, the justices took the rare step of hearing arguments in an emergency appeal. It's unclear how the case will come out, but the court seemed intent on keeping the changes on hold while looking for a way to scale back nationwide court orders.",
      "One possibility advanced by some justices was to find a different legal mechanism, perhaps a class action, to accomplish essentially the same thing as the nationwide injunctions blocking Trump's citizenship order.",
      "Nationwide injunctions have emerged as an important check on Trump\u2019s efforts to remake the government and a source of mounting frustration to the Republican president and his allies.",
      "Judges have issued 40 nationwide injunctions since Trump began his second term in January, Sauer told the court during the arguments.",
      "The court could act anytime, but almost certainly no later than early summer.",

      "Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into the crowd",
      "BOULDER, Colo. -- Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd. The FBI immediately described the violence as a \u201ctargeted terror attack.\u201d",
      "The suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d during the Sunday attack on the group of demonstrators, said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Denver field office.",
      "Soliman was arrested and taken to the hospital for treatment, but authorities didn\u2019t elaborate on his injuries.",
      "Here is what we know about the attack:",
      "Authorities said the attacker targeted demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run for Their Lives, which organizes run and walk events to call for the immediate release of the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza since they were captured by militants during the incursion into southern Israel that started the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.",
      "The group had gathered at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and students.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war has inflamed global tensions and contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. A week earlier, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot to death in Washington by a man who yelled \u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza\u201d as he was being led away by police.",
      "Police in Boulder evacuated multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear.",
      "The violence occurred four years after 10 people were killed a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.",
      "The people injured in the Pearl Street attack range in age from 52 to 88.",
      "Photos from the scene showed a woman lying on the ground in the fetal position with her hair soaked, and a man helping her and getting water from someone with a water jug.",
      "The injuries authorities found were consistent with reports of people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said, adding that injuries ranged from serious to minor.",
      "Redfearn told reporters Sunday evening that it was too early to discuss a motive but that witnesses were being interviewed.",
      "\u201cIt would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on,\u201d he said.",
      "Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene. No charges were immediately announced, but officials said they expect to hold him \u201cfully accountable.\u201d",
      "Video from the scene showed him shirtless and wearing jeans and holding two clear bottles with a transparent liquid in them while shouting at onlookers.",
      "Another video shows a witness shouting, \u201cHe\u2019s right there. He\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails,\u201d as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect.",
      "FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism, and the Justice Department \u2014 which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations \u2014 decried the attack as a \u201cneedless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,\u201d FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.",

    "story": [
      "An attorney for Harvey Weinstein says he doesn't plan to testify in his New York sex crimes retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein doesn't plan to testify at his New York sex crimes retrial, his lawyer said Sunday. That means jurors soon will get the case against the former movie studio boss who propelled the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct.",
      "The trial will move on to closing arguments Tuesday without testimony from Weinstein, Arthur Aidala said Sunday night. The court handles other cases on Mondays.",
      "It's unclear whether jury deliberations would begin Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday.",
      "It was a fraught decision for Weinstein, who didn\u2019t testify at previous trials in New York and California and was convicted in both. He denies the allegations, and Aidala has said that Weinstein was carefully weighing whether to take the stand this time.",
      "While his California appeal winds on, Weinstein won a new trial in his New York rape and sexual assault case when the state\u2019s highest court overturned his 2020 conviction.",
      "He's charged in New York with raping Jessica Mann in 2013 and forcing oral sex on Miriam Haley and Kaja Sokola, separately, in 2006. Mann was an actor and hairstylist, Haley a production assistant and producer, and Sokola a model who aspired to an acting career.",
      "All three women testified for days at the retrial, giving emotional and graphic accounts of what they say they endured. They said Weinstein suggested he'd help them achieve their show-business dreams, but then maneuvered them into private settings and preyed on them.",
      "His attorneys have argued that anything that happened between him and his accusers was consensual.",
      "In the U.S., defendants in criminal cases aren't obligated to testify, and many decide not to, for various reasons. Among them: the prospect of being questioned by prosecutors.",
      "Weinstein has been watching the New York retrial intently from the defense table, sometimes shaking his head at accusers\u2019 testimony and often leaning over to one or another of his attorneys to convey his thoughts.",
      "Aidala said outside court Thursday that Weinstein thought a lot of holes had been poked in the accusers' accounts, but that he also was pondering whether jurors would feel they needed to hear from him.",
      "The jury has heard from a few other defense witnesses \u2014 one of them via a transcript read by court employees.",
      "That witness, Talita Maia, testified at the 2020 trial but was unavailable this time, so jurors instead got a reading Friday of her earlier testimony. One court stenographer voiced the 2020 attorneys' questions, while another stenographer sat in the witness box and rendered Maia's answers, at times with emphasis.",
      "Maia and Mann were roommates and friends in 2013 but later fell out. According to Maia, Mann never mentioned in those days that Weinstein had hurt her in any way. Both Maia and another witness, Thomas Richards, met up with Mann and Weinstein shortly after Mann has said she was raped.",
      "Both witnesses testified that they saw nothing amiss.",
      "Mann testified earlier this month that she never anyone at the time that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her because she didn't think she'd be believed, and she was scared about how he might react.",
      "Weinstein's defense also brought in former Sokola pal Helga Samuelsen, who has friendly ties to the former producer. Samuelsen testified Thursday that Weinstein visited Sokola once and spent about a half-hour in a bedroom with her in a New York apartment the women briefly shared in 2005; Sokola told jurors no such thing happened.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Sokola, Mann and Haley have given their permission to be identified.",

    "summary": "The writer-producer-voice artist behind the animated hit is also a crooner of the Great American Songbook. He is now releasing a new album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements.\"",
    "story": [
      "Even if you're not a regular \"Family Guy\" viewer, you've probably heard the show's iconic theme song. The song is largely the creation of Seth MacFarlane, whose love of animation may only be rivaled by his love for big, jazzy tunes. In fact, he's even got a semi-regular gig at the Vibrato Grill Jazz Club in Bel Air, Calif., singing songs from the Great American Songbook.",
      "But one thing he doesn't seem to love, considering he's lived his life in the public eye, is a certain kind of attention. He says sometimes getting in front of a crowd (or even our \"Sunday Morning\" cameras) doesn't quite come naturally.",
      "He is, he admits, an introvert. \"Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. I don't even wanna be here!\" he said.",
      "In fact, he says he sometimes has to resort to liquid courage. \"I think I had like four scotches before I walked out on stage at the Oscars,\" he said, referring to his hosting gig in 2013. \"I do get, yeah, I definitely get nervous.\"",
      "You might know MacFarlane as the voice of Peter, Brian Griffin and Stewie on the show \"Family Guy\" that he created more than two decades ago. In 1999, MacFarlane became the youngest showrunner in Hollywood history. And less than a decade later, with three network shows on the air, he became Hollywood's highest-paid writer-producer.",
      "But back in college, MacFarlane's first love was singing. \"My sister, at the time, was going to the Boston Conservatory of Music for musical theater,\" he said. \"She has a beautiful singing voice. And I had got it into my head that I was going to maybe go to grad school for musical theater as well. So, I applied and got in. And I was all set to go to their grad program. And I got this offer from Hanna-Barbera to come do an animated short for a series that they were developing. And so, I just had to take it, moved out to California. But there was an instant there where I could have kind of diverged into a completely different career and never, you know, never even thought about something called 'Family Guy.'\"",
      "MacFarlane loved film scores as a college student and to this day he uses a live orchestra to score his TV shows.\u00a0 \"It's the one part that I don't really understand, even to this day,\" he said. \"There's still something mysterious about how a composer sits down to write, and then a couple weeks later walks in front of an orchestra, plops down these charts, and they all play it. And you hear this insane, magical sound. That still eludes me.\"",
      "Frank Sinatra Jr, and Stewie and Brian (Seth MacFarlane), perform \"At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant (Jr.)\" from \"Family Guy\":",
      "For his latest album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\" (out this week), MacFarlane and Joel McNeely (his composer for \"American Dad!\" and \"The Orville\") combed through the Sinatra Family archives for songs that had been arranged for Sinatra but never fully recorded. For McNeely, the process was almost like speaking to the ghosts of the greatest arrangers in popular music, the men who helped make Sinatra's voice shine.",
      "McNeely showed an arrangement by Nelson Riddle: \"This was the first one we read when we had a sight-reading session at Fox. We got an orchestra together just to see what was there, you know, because there was nothing to reference. But all this time later, these little black pencil dots on paper, there's his voice brought back to life. I mean, it was chilling.\"",
      "So, what exactly does an arranger do? \"Frank Sinatra, there's a recording of him saying that the arrangers could be in a sense a recording secretary, taking the vision of the artist and interpreting it into this,\" McNeely said.",
      "MacFarlane said, \"You take a song like 'Fly Me to the Moon,' for example, which I think was originally a ballad. [Here], it's the same song, but it's a completely different animal.\"",
      "McNeely says MacFarlane is preserving the essential legacy of the American Songbook through his recordings and the music of the TV show \"Family Guy.\" But what about the legacy of \"Family Guy\"? MacFarlane has some thoughts: \"When I started the show \u2013 this is the conversation that, like, tortures me at night! \u2013 when I started the show, my attitude was, it doesn't matter, none of it matters. It's like, It's funny? Let's do it.",
      "\"And the older I've gotten, I look back at shows that we've done, and I'm like, Gosh, I guess it's a little more complicated than that, isn't it? Comedy and jokes do have an impact. I have to figure out a way to maintain what the show is, and maintain the thing that people love. But at the same time, recognize that, like, all right, I am analyzing it now in a different way than I did when I was younger.\"",
      "If it's true that you're nobody 'till somebody loves you, then thanks to \"Family Guy\"'s legion of fans, Seth MacFarlane, it turns out, is a very big somebody indeed.",
      "Seth MacFarlane performs \"Give Me the Simple Life,\" from his album \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\":",
      "CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Joel McNeely was the composer and arranger for \"Family Guy.\" He was in fact the composer for two other Seth MacFarlane series, \"American Dad!\" and \"The Orville.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Audra McDonald won her first Tony Award at 23, it was just the beginning of a record-breaking Broadway career. Earlier this month, she received her 11th Tony nomination, making her the most Tony-nominated actor of all time.",
      "McDonald received the nomination for her portrayal of Mama Rose in the latest Broadway revival of \"Gypsy.\" If she wins this Sunday, she'll make history as the performer with the most Tonys ever.",
      "Before she discovered the stage, McDonald described herself as a hyperactive kid who would express her emotions frequently.",
      "\"I had big feelings. I had music in my heart. And so once I found theater, it was like I have a place to put my big feelings now,\" she said.",
      "Those emotions are on full display as Mama Rose, a character based on the real-life mother of famed burlesque entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee. It is currently being shown at the Majestic Theatre. In the musical, Mama Rose is an intense stage mom.",
      "McDonald first stepped into the role during a concert at Carnegie Hall in 2022, performing the musical's emotional climax \"Rose's Turn.\"",
      "\"It was the same time of year that I was getting ready to send my daughter off to college. And I was dealing with all this rage I was having at my sweet, wonderful daughter,\" McDonald said. \"And I burst into tears and I realized it's because my baby's leaving and I'm sad. So then that was my first sort, like, emotional dive into Rose.\"",
      "McDonald is the first Black woman to portray Mama Rose on Broadway. Director George C. Wolfe guided her interpretation of what Rose would be experiencing in the 1920s and 30s, with not one word of the original script changed.",
      "\"George talks a lot about Rose's obsession with the kids becoming stars is because being a star protects you in some way. You got star money, you could eat. You got star money, maybe you won't be lynched,\" McDonald explained. \"And so she as a single woman at this time, abandoned three times by her husbands, abandoned by her mother, not really treated all that well by her father, she's tryin' to protect these babies.\"",
      "Behind the Curtain",
      "The \"CBS Mornings\" interview went backstage to find out what happens when the curtain closes. McDonald and her co-star Danny Burstein are \"of a certain age,\" she laughed, noting they don't run up the stairs after performances.",
      "McDonald showed how she warms up to take on the demanding role.",
      "\"One thing that a lotta singers do is humming. Just like (humming), you're doing things like that just to sort of and people do that, whether you're singing or not. It's good just to sort of make sure that everything's sort of moving and healthy. And you know, to do it eight times a week,\" she said.",
      "Inspiring the next generation",
      "Despite her countless accolades, McDonald still struggles with being called a legend.",
      "\"If it can mean something to some little Black girl somewhere who says 'She did it and she looks like me so I can do it,' great,\" she said. \"But I can't really comprehend what that means to me about me. You know what I mean? 'Cause I can't, you know, as I see how dirty my closet is, and the fact that I have not done laundry in four weeks.\"",

    "summary": "Organizers say climate campaigner Greta Thunberg and other activists set sail Sunday for Gaza on a ship aimed at \"breaking Israel's siege\" of the territory.",
    "story": [
      "Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg and 11 other activists set sail for the Gaza Strip on Sunday afternoon, aboard a ship carrying aid. The mission is aimed at \"breaking Israel's siege\" of the devastated territory, organizers said.",
      "\"Game of Thrones\" actor Liam Cunningham and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, are also among the crew. Hassan has been barred from entering Israel due to her active opposition to the Israeli assault on Gaza.",
      "The sailing boat Madleen \u2014 operated by activist group Freedom Flotilla Coalition \u2014 departed from the Sicilian port of Catania, in southern Italy.",
      "\"'Madleen' sails to Gaza today with twelve humanitarians and as much life-saving aid as she can carry, including baby formula, medical supplies, and more. She departs from European territorial waters, sailing entirely through international waters into Palestinian waters off Gaza,\" the coalition wrote\u00a0in a social media post Sunday. \"Unarmed and nonviolent, 'Madleen' poses no threat. She sails in full accordance with international law. Any attack or interference will be a deliberate, unlawful assault on civilians.\"",
      "As the crew tries to reach the shores of Gaza, they hope their trip will raise \"international awareness\" over the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the activists said at a press conference on Sunday, ahead of departure.",
      "\"We are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying,\" Thunberg said, bursting into tears during her speech.",
      "\"Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it's not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the live-streamed genocide,\" she added.",
      "Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic \"blood libel.\"",
      "In mid-May, Israel slightly eased its blockade of Gaza after nearly three months, allowing a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the territory.",
      "Experts have warned that Gaza is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped.",
      "Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month.",
      "That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group's vessels, the \"Conscience,\" was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.",
      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",
      "The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza's civilians.",
      "\"We are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that's part of a broader strategy of mobilizations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,\" said activist Thiago Avila.",
      "Avila cited the upcoming Global March to Gaza \u2014 an international initiative also open to doctors, lawyers and media \u2014 which is set to leave Egypt and reach the Rafah crossing in mid-June to stage a protest there, asking Israel to stop the Gaza offensive and reopen the border.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-clinton-and-james-patterson-on-their-new-thriller-the-first-gentleman/",

    "summary": "Former President Bill Clinton and author James Patterson have teamed up for their third book, a thriller: \"The First Gentleman,\" in which the commander-in-chief is a woman \u2013 and her husband stands accused of murder.",
    "story": [
      "Seems that there is always a lot going on behind the walls of the White House where truth can often be stranger than fiction. But fiction can be pretty compelling, too. In the new novel \"The First Gentleman\" (to be published June 2 by Little, Brown & Co.), the commander in chief is a woman, and her husband is accused of murder. It's the third collaboration from best-selling author James Patterson and his co-writer, President Bill Clinton.",
      "Was there a scenario in the book that Patterson couldn't have written without Clinton's help? \"Oh, I couldn't have done any of it without him,\" Patterson said. \"I would have been lost. But the other thing, you know, look, I mean, he's the expert on the first gentleman. You know, he was almost a first gentleman!\"",
      "\"Yeah, I thought about it for years. And it's the only political job I ever wanted and I didn't get!\" Clinton smiled. \"'Cause I really thought Hillary should be president.\"",
      "Clinton would have been the very first first gentleman had his wife, Hillary, won the 2016 election. And he says back then he did a lot of thinking about what his role would be as a presidential spouse: \"How could I do this job in a way that I would be on-call to help if she needed me, but I wouldn't get in the way?\"",
      "\"That's the way I feel about this relationship: How can I help without getting in the way?\" Patterson said. \"I'm kind of the first gentleman of our [relationship]!\"",
      "\"If you believe that, I got some land in Arizona I want to show you!\" Clinton laughed.",
      "And sometimes, their made-up White House looks almost like real life. In the book, the president keeps working through an agonizing personal crisis. During his 1999 impeachment proceedings, President Clinton kept working, too, with some of the very people who were trying to kick him out of the White House. \"And they were amazed by it,\" he said. \"They'd come and do business with me, [and] as far as they knew, I couldn't remember what was going on. And we would try to hammer out deals.\" In the midst of impeachment? \"Because that's what I got hired to do,\" Clinton said. \"The American people don't pay you to have personal feelings. They pay you to deliver for them.\"",
      "Clinton and Patterson have been delivering since 2018, with their first book about a president gone missing, and in 2021 their second about the president's daughter getting kidnapped. Both were bestsellers. But for them, it's really not all about work.",
      "Asked how their relationship has evolved over their three books together, Clinton replied, \"We've played a lot more golf.\"",
      "Patterson said, \"He's been president more times, but I have more holes-in-one.\"",
      "\"Oh God. Well, I have one; he has nine,\" said Clinton. \"How many Americans have nine holes-in-one?\"",
      "\"I know. That's sick,\" Patterson said. \"Remember I'm a fiction writer.\"",
      "\"Makes the craziness stop for a little while\"",
      "I asked, \"There's so much political drama in the world today, real-life political drama. Do you think that there's an appetite for political thrillers, for fictional political thrillers?\"",
      "Patterson said, \"I think so, 100%. I mean, one of the nice things here is you escape, but you don't totally escape reality. It's like, 'Yeah, I love this. I can't put it down.' Or 'I keep reading,' or in some cases to me what's even better, which is you don't want it to end.",
      "\"I think it's useful, and 'cause so many people are wandering around, they go, 'Oh my God, oh my God, please make it stop'? This makes it stop for a little while, makes the craziness stop for a little while for people.\"",
      "Clinton said, \"One reason I hope there's an appetite is\u2026 I hope that people will still believe in our democratic system enough to stick with it and keep pushing to make it work.\"",
      "During the summer, Patterson lives at his home on the Hudson River; the president is about five miles away.",
      "Asked what they may have learned about each other during the writing process, Patterson offered, \"the notion \u2026 of not worrying about stuff that we can't do anything about. And if we can do something about it, try to do it.\"",
      "Their new book comes out tomorrow and they hope it's another bestseller. But if you spend any time at all with Patterson and Clinton, you get the sense that their partnership is about something money can't buy.",
      "I asked, \"Back when you wrote your first book together, The New York Times said that the two of you 'complete each other in the Jerry Maguire sense.'\"",
      "\"Well, we kinda do,\" Patterson said. \"This has been driving me for months now, which is: my time here is short. What can I do most beautifully? And in this case, doing another book with my friend is a beautiful thing to do.\"",

      "Prologue",
      "President Wright AdministrationYear Three: September",
      "1Brentwood, New Hampshire",
      "Cole Wright is sitting in the rear seat of a black up-armored Chevy Suburban, one of three in a convoy speeding its way down Route 125 in the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire.",
      "Two dark green state police cruisers, lights flashing, are leading this no-frills motorcade, scaled down for the occasion. The presidential limousine \u2014 the Beast \u2014 is back at the airport, along with the Secret Service counterassault team, support personnel, news media vans, and a fully equipped ambulance.",
      "Three years after the election, Cole still gets pumped from seeing traffic part like magic, even though he's well aware that it's for the convenience and safety of the woman sitting beside him \u2014 his wife, Madeline Parson Wright, the president of the United States.",
      "He's just the First Gentleman.",
      "A light drizzle spatters against the bulletproof windows. The agent accelerates to seventy along the two-lane highway.",
      "\"Two minutes out,\" says Burton Pearce, the president's chief of staff. Pearce perches in a rear-facing jump seat across from the First Couple. He's pale and serious, wearing one of his many identical gray suits. \"The Gray Ghost,\" staffers call him. The president nods without looking up.",
      "Cole glances over to see the CONFIDENTIAL stamps on the pages Maddy is reading as the convoy hums along. He knows those pages represent the biggest political gamble of her administration \u2014 of any administration. She should be in the Oval Office working the phones and twisting arms, but instead she's here with him. A powerful personal show of support.",
      "Maddy puts her briefing packet aside. Cole takes her hand and squeezes it.",
      "She squeezes back. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"After all we've been through together, we can get through this too.\"",
      "The Suburban slows down to make a hard turn behind the police escort. Now the convoy is moving at just forty miles per hour. On both sides of the route, locals hold up crude hand-painted placards.",
      "WE BELIEVE IN YOU, COLE!",
      "STAY STRONG, COLE!",
      "KEEP MOVING, COLE!",
      "He looks out through the tinted side window. Almost game time. He can feel his muscles twitching, his focus narrowing, just like in his days as a tight end for New England \u2014 before the blown knee forced him out. He remembers how the tension in the Patriots locker room would build and build almost to the breaking point until the team ran out into the light, and when the cheers of the crowd washed over him, he'd think, Yeah, we're okay. We've got this.",
      "But today?",
      "Today he's not so sure.",
      "The redbrick facade of the Rockingham County courthouse comes into view. The road is lined with police barricades holding back hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of onlookers. Up here, some of the signs have a different tone.",
      "SCUM!",
      "MONSTER!",
      "JUSTICE FOR SUZANNE!",
      "\"Don't worry about these people,\" says Maddy. \"They don't know what they're talking about.\"",
      "\"I don't care about the people on the road,\" says Cole. \"I'm worried about the twelve people waiting for me inside.\"",
      "As the Suburban slows to a crawl, two women jump out in front and unspool a long banner.",
      "CONVICT COLE WRIGHT! SEND HIM STRAIGHT TO HELL!",
      "Thanks for the kind wishes, Cole thinks.",
      "2",
      "A thousand demonstrators, media people, and curious locals are crowded into the rain-slick parking lot. The convoy is passing through the tall evergreens flanking the pavement leading up to the courthouse when I realize I left my umbrella in my car. Too late.",
      "Rockingham County has never drawn security like this. Uniforms representing every law enforcement department in New Hampshire \u2014 from local cops to Fish and Game \u2014 are patrolling the courthouse steps. On the roof there's a detail of men and women in tactical gear and black baseball caps carrying sniper rifles. They're not even trying to hide. That's the job of their colleagues, posted in places nobody can see.",
      "I hear someone calling my name: \"Brea Cooke? That you?\"",
      "I look at the crowd. Mostly white. No surprise; the Granite State is around 89 percent Caucasian. It's a situation I got used to as a Black student at Dartmouth, about two hours north. Let's just say it's not unusual for me to stand out around here.",
      "I turn around. \"Ron Reynolds!\"",
      "Ron is a friendly face from the old days when he and my partner, Garrett Wilson, both reported for the Boston Globe. He's wearing his standard outfit \u2014 tan overcoat, khaki pants, and a tweed cap. His big press pass is dangling around his neck.",
      "I give him a quick hug. \"Guess we both forgot our umbrellas.\"",
      "A guy in a thick camo jacket jostles by us and flicks a finger at Ron's press pass. \"Fake news!\" the guy shouts. Ron ignores him.",
      "\"So why are you here?\" I ask. \"You could be in one of those gyms right now, dry and toasty. Probably getting a better view than this.\"",
      "\"I get paid to get wet,\" says Ron. \"Even if nothing happens.\"",
      "But something is happening. I've been waiting for this day a long time. I see flashing lights coming up the drive. Two state police cars and three big black SUVs.",
      "\"It's them!\"",
      "The lights are getting closer. I'm in the middle of the crowd, but suddenly I feel as alone as I've ever felt in my life.",
      "I close my eyes for a second. My mind whispers, Garrett.",
      "I blink hard. Not now! I need to focus. Capture this scene for my book. Our book. The one Garrett and I were working on together. Until he ...",
      "Ron points to the courthouse steps. \"See the podium and the camera stands up there?\"",
      "I nod. \"What about them?\"",
      "\"All for show. No way the Secret Service allows the president and First Gent to go through the front entrance.\"",
      "\"The crowd won't appreciate being tricked like that.\"",
      "\"You're right,\" says Ron. \"They came to witness history.\"",
      "So did I.",
      "The first time in history that a president's spouse is going on trial for murder.",
      "3",
      "The convoy crawls toward the entrance as cops push the crowds back. Inside the six-ton Suburban in the middle, Cole rubs his hands together nervously. Pearce leans forward in his jump seat and says, \"The county sheriffs, state troopers, and Secret Service have carved out a path so we can go around to the rear of the courthouse. By the time the crowd and the press catch on, we'll be inside and out of sight.\"",
      "Hidden away, Cole thinks. \"No,\" he says quietly. \"That's not going to happen.\"",
      "Pearce blinks. \"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"I said no. Going in through the rear of the courthouse signals that I'm guilty, that I have something to hide. Screw that. I'm going to run the ball straight through the line of scrimmage.\"",
      "The Suburban moves toward the driveway turnoff. Pearce is getting testy. \"Cole, plans have been in place for days. Best to arrive via the rear from both a safety and PR viewpoint.\"",
      "But Cole is firm. \"We go through the front door. That's final.\"",
      "He turns to his wife. \"Maddy, will you say a few words on the courthouse steps?\"",
      "It's a big ask. Maddy doesn't need to tell him the source of the tension in her eyes. The conflict between being his loving partner while serving as POTUS, leader of the free world, is etched on her face.",
      "Maddy looks at her chief of staff. \"Cole is right, Burton. We go through the front entrance, heads held high.\"",
      "\"But, ma'am, we're just about there. Arrangements have been made.\"",
      "Cole sees Maddy shift into commander-in-chief mode. Cool. Crisp. Decisive. \"You've got a phone,\" she says. \"Make new arrangements.\"",
      "4",
      "They're getting out!\" Ron grabs my sleeve.",
      "Sure enough, I hear the slamming of heavy car doors and see movement at the front of the courthouse steps. The Secret Service is scrambling to clear a path to the podium.",
      "\"That takes some brass ones!\" Ron calls to me above the rising noise.",
      "A ring of dark suits surrounds President Wright and her broad-shouldered husband.",
      "The president walks up the wide steps and pivots to the podium. The crowd surges forward. Cops push back. Secret Service agents watch the sea of faces. And hands. Especially the hands. Looking for weapons.",
      "President Wright squeezes her husband's arm just before she leans into the microphones. \"Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, I will make this short and to the point.\"",
      "I hear her voice echo across the parking lot. She pauses after each phrase to let the words sink in.",
      "\"I have full faith and confidence in my husband's innocence, and I trust that the good citizens of New Hampshire, who have stood by my side over the years, will also support my husband during this time of crisis.\"",
      "The president turns and kisses her husband's cheek, making sure the cameras have a good angle. Then, as if it's an after-thought, she steps up to the mics again and says, \"I believe in our legal system, and I'm confident justice will be done here.\"",
      "She takes her husband's hand. The Secret Service team surrounds them. As a unit, they walk up the steps to the courthouse doors.",
      "\"Quite a performance,\" says Reynolds.",
      "\"It was a performance all right. Pure theater. They're not a couple \u2014 they're a damn criminal enterprise.\"",
      "My outburst must surprise Ron. A second later, he heads off to gather quotes.",
      "Once again, I'm alone. I scan the masses. Almost every man, woman, and child is looking toward the courthouse, trying to get one last glimpse of the First Couple.",
      "On the far side of the parking lot, I spot the lone exceptions: a man and a woman, looking straight at me.",
      "I've seen these two before. My watchers.",
      "Damn. Not again.",
      "The crowd shifts, and they disappear.",
      "All around me, people are chattering and yelling, but their words are a blanket of white noise. Again my mind whispers, Garrett. I hold out my hand, half expecting to see him reaching for me.",
      "I fight back the tears as reality hits home.",
      "The love of my life, Garrett Wilson, is dead. And I believe the man inside that courthouse is responsible for his death.",
      "The First Gentleman.",
      "He might even have pulled the trigger.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Emmy Award-winning actress Loretta Swit (Nov. 4, 1937-May 30, 2025) was best known for bringing Maj. Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan to full life on the long-running TV series \"M*A*S*H.\" The head nurse of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War, Houlihan brought her by-the-book attitude for Army rules against the anti-authoritarian streak of Alan Alda's \"Hawkeye\" Pierce. The series was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, and while toned down for television, the CBS series, produced by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, aimed to maintain the movie's anti-establishment ethos during the turmoil of the Vietnam War.",
      "After small roles on \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Mannix\" and \"Hawaii Five-O,\" Swit was called in to meet the producers of \"M*A*S*H.\" Then her agent informed her that she'd received an offer to appear in a movie with Olivia de Havilland, which conflicted with shooting the pilot. But \"M*A*S*H\" producer Gene Reynold told the agent, \"Nope, don't give her away. She's ours,\" Swit recalled in a 2020 Edge Magazine interview.",
      "As the show progressed, Swit expanded her character beyond being the target of the doctors' pranks, and fought against her character being tied down by her affair with Maj. Frank Burns (played by Larry Linville). She suggested that Hot Lips break up with Frank, meet a dashing man in Tokyo, and get engaged, married \u2013 and divorced. \"We really worked together like a well-oiled machine \u2013 everybody on this show worked together with the writers,\" she told Edge. \"You had these creative people, throwing ideas back and forth in positive, wonderful, rich ways. It was a very exciting time to be around, to be an actor in that situation. You could not help but get better and grow and learn.\"",
      "She won two Emmys for playing Houlihan, and received eight more nominations. She was also nominated for four Golden Globes. Although some actors came and went, Swit lasted throughout the show's 11-season run, which concluded in 1983.",
      "A native of Passaic, N.J., Swit had to overcome her mother's aversion to her becoming an actress. She recalled to the Toronto Star in 2010 her mom's reaction after attending a play in a Greenwich Village theater, \"walking in as though it were the doorway to Hades. After the show, I came out and my mother said to my father, 'If you don't stop her now, she may wind up doing this for the rest of her life.' That was it. That gave me the courage I needed to keep at it until I succeeded.\"",
      "On stage she starred in \"Same Time, Next Year,\" \"Shirley Valentine,\" and \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\" Other screen appearances include \"Freebie and the Bean,\" \"S.O.B.,\" and \"Murder She Wrote.\" She also founded a charity, the SwitHeart Animal Alliance.",
      "Houlihan would inspire countless women to become nurses, in part because the show was closer to reality that other medical shows. \"Up until 'M*A*S*H,' the doctors on television didn't lose patients; they always pulled them through,\" she said. \"That's nice, but it's not honest. We used to say that 'M*A*S*H' is not a John Wayne movie about war. In our series, people died, patients died, people got wounded and hurt. And we never stop talking about the ugliness of it. The humor came out of our own madness and craziness to have to be there to do that. The only way to survive was by being crazy and funny and drunk. I think 'M*A*S*H' took on cult status because we told everybody the truth.\""

    "story": [
      "Patti LuPone\u00a0has issued an apology after hundreds of Broadway performers spoke out against the three-time Tony Awards winner over what they say is a pattern of \"inappropriate and unacceptable public comments,\" specifically against Broadway star Kecia Lewis, in an open letter.",
      "\"For as long as I have worked in the theatre, I have spoken my mind and never apologized. That is changing today.\" LuPone said in her apology posted Saturday on social media.",
      "Lupone issued the apology in response to a\u00a0letter, dated May 30\u00a0 and addressed to the American Theatre Wing, the national trade association for the Broadway theatre industry, calling on decision makers to \"hold people accountable for violent, disrespectful, or harmful behavior.\" More than 500 Broadway performers \u2014 including\u00a0James Monroe Iglehart, Kalen Allen and\u00a0Tatianna C\u00f3rdoba \u2014 signed the open letter, which was first published in\u00a0Playbill.",
      "It comes after the New Yorker published an interview last week with 76-year-old LuPone, a White performer, in which she said of Lewis, who is a Black actress said: \"Don't call yourself a vet, bitch,\" apparently referring to Lewis' November 2024 video\u00a0posted to her Instagram\u00a0in which she spoke about LuPone's behavior.",
      "\"This language is not only degrading and misogynistic-it is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment. It is emblematic of the microaggressions and abuse that people in this industry have endured for far too long, too often without consequence,\" said the open letter.",
      "LuPone's issue with Lewis appeared to have began last fall when she starred in\u00a0\"The Roommate,\" a two-woman show with Mia Farrow\u00a0that was next door to\u00a0\"Hell's Kitchen,\"\u00a0a musical inspired by Alicia Key's life and music in which Lewis performed and won Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.",
      "According to Lewis' video, LuPone had made complaints about the noise from the musical, which led to changes to the sound design that \"negatively impacted\" the show and its performers. Lewis also brought up a video of LuPone refusing to sign a fan's \"Hell's Kitchen\" playbill because the musical is \"too loud.\"",
      "\"I wanted to address this because, Ms. LuPone, these actions, in my opinion, are bullying,\" Lewis said in the video. \"They're offensive, they are racially microaggressive, they're rude, they're rooted in privilege. And these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself, who has been in the business as long as you have.\"",
      "Lewis then asked LuPone, from one Broadway veteran to another, to apologize.",
      "When asked, LuPone addressed the situation in the New Yorker article, saying, \"This is not unusual on Broadway. This happens all the time when walls are shared.\"",
      "\"She calls herself a veteran? Let's find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn't know what the f--- she's talking about,\" LuPone told the New Yorker.",
      "CBS News has reached out to LuPone and Lewis for comment.",
      "When the New Yorker asked about Audra McDonald, who appeared to support Lewis' video, LuPone said: \"That's typical of Audra. She's not a friend.\" She added that the two had issues in the past, but didn't go into details.",
      "In her apology on Saturday, LuPone said she regrets her \"flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate, and I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in this community.\"",
      "\"I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies,\" LuPone added. \"I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter shared yesterday. From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theatre has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don't belong anywhere else. I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theatre community deserves better.\"",
      "McDonald, the most nominated and awarded performer in Tony Award history, told CBS News' Gayle King in an interview set to air Tuesday on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings\" that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years.",
      "\"If there's a rift between us, I don't know what it is. That's something you'd have to ask Patti about,\" McDonald said.",
      "Next week on June 8, the Tony Awards are set to broadcast on CBS and stream on Paramount+. McDonald could add snatch her seventh Tony win thanks to the revival of \"Gypsy.\"",

      "Swit starred on stage and screen, but she was perhaps best known for her long-running role as the head nurse who was a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce on \"M*A*S*H,\" which aired for 11 seasons on CBS, from 1972 to 1983.",
      "The show was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, a landmark celebrated for its freewheeling humor, its satirical approach to war movies, the excess of blood in the operating room and the nudity of its nurses.

      "The large ensemble included Wayne Rogers as Capt. \"Trapper\" John McIntyre, McLean Stevenson as Lt. Col. Henry Blake, Larry Linville as Maj. Frank Burns, and William Christopher as Father Francis Mulcahy.

      "After years of largely predictable norovirus waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain called GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks.",
      "\"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years,\" wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in an article published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.",
      "Outbreaks have since slowed to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.",
      "\"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined,\" the CDC researchers wrote.",
      "Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance.",
      "In England, norovirus reports reached levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus through April, far above GII.4.",
      "In Japan, where GII.17 previously drove a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo reported a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis \u2014 most from norovirus \u2014 that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.",
      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",
      "\"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave,\" Lopman said in an email.",

      "Turns out, that inmate known only as \"Angie\" was right. That was 2018, and Jacobs still marvels at the gesture.",
      "\"The incredible kindness of a stranger to know that not only did she recognize this, but she recognized my mom as being vulnerable and then kept her sane,\" Jacobs said.",
      "Jacobs now had a clear path thanks to a to a stranger she'd never be able to thank.",
      "But with the context of dementia, Jacobs was able to figure out a lot. She recalled that her grandmother had similar impulsive behaviors.",
      "It was genetic \u2014 it was the mapT mutation of frontal dementia known as FTD. It's a disease that hits at 50, and instead of losing memories, patients often lose impulse control and self-awareness.",
      "\"Honestly, I had a lot of guilt that I was so intolerant to those symptoms when my mom would display them,\" said Jacobs.",
      "Jacobs watched her mom progress; one day Lee fell and hit her head. Because of the FTD, her brain couldn't take the swelling and she died at 62, leaving devastation and frustration.",
      "\"I had that understanding level while she was alive, this is not her, she is not doing this to me, this is happening because this disease is causing this symptom,\" Jacobs said.",
      "But she says it was hard to separate her mom from those symptoms. Amidst the grief, she learned that she and her two sisters had the gene, too. Jacobs said immediately, her mind went to her little girls.",
      "\"Truly, that I passed it on to my daughters,\" she said.",
      "Jacobs realized that there was very little information about MapT. She could barely Google the condition that she was most certainly going to have.",
      "Then, she and her husband happened to see a documentary on gene editing.",
      "\"And so he just Google searched \"FTD, CRISPR,\" and then we came across a physician that's based out of San Francisco, Dr. Claire Clelland,\" said Jacobs.",
      "\"It's just a matter of time\"",
      "In a busy laboratory on the other side of the country, Clelland received an email.",
      "\"I get contacted from patients, particularly gene carriers from around the world, but I remember just replying that I would try to help in the best way that I could,\" she said.",
      "That was the start of a powerful friendship.",
      "Jacobs set out on an advocacy journey across the nation, speaking to the nation's top neurologists and making them better understand this tricky and brutal disease that effects 40,000 Americans, essentially putting FTD on the map.",
      "Clelland said Jacobs' personal touch has fueled the process.",
      "\"And if you look at new therapies that make it through the pipeline and actually get to patients, often, they have patient supporters and champions that don't give up even when the work gets really hard,\" Clelland said.",
      "And that hard work landed Jacobs on the front page of the New York Times. From her frustration, to her grief, to that inmate's letter, she laid out her story for the world to see, giving her even more opportunity for revelations like the one she had in February inside a University of Minnesota research lab.",
      "It's there she saw a mouse with the frontal temporal dementia mutation she has. That mouse is a symbol of hope. It's part of promising research at the University of Minnesota.",
      "\"Linde sent me an email, she's actually the first FTD patient I've ever met,\" said Dr. Michael Koob, who is leading a team of researchers.",
      "Koob and his students are getting promising results for a treatment for people who know they have the gene.",
      "\"So, so for her, it's just a matter of time. This is going to happen. You know, at this point, I'm fairly confident that there will be an intervention that is going to work,\" said Koob.",
      "From the mice to the microscopes, things are looking up.",
      "WCCO followed Jacobs and her pursuit for two months. During that time, she had another breakthrough. It came at a coffee shop in River Falls, Wisconsin.",
      "A reunion",
      "After years, Jacobs finally found the inmate who had sent her the initial letter about her mom. She messaged her on Facebook, and the two set up a time to meet.",
      "When Jacobs met Angela Olson, the tears welled.",
      "\"I have no idea what the Lord is doing. I think it's amazing that he brought our lives together. I never realized, even writing that letter, what it was doing, right? I just knew that your mom was a really great person and needed help,\" said Olson.",
      "As they marveled at the letter, they marveled at the moment.",
      "\"I think there's so many times in life that, like, people are brought into our lives, right, for a poor purpose, right, and a bigger purpose,\" said Jacobs.",
      "\"Yeah, she's actually the beginning of my journey with sobriety,\" said Olson.",
      "Olson knew the ropes when it came to jail; she was 20 years into her addiction.",
      "\"Never, all these years, my whole life, I never understood how to have, actually, emotions. It's like I was rejected in my life, betrayed by people, but yet understand how to have love or emotion, and just was so suppressed. And so then I ended up coming to Teen Challenge,\" Olson said.",
      "Now she's seven years sober and thriving as a manager at Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge Recovery program. She spends her days sharing her story.",
      "Olson recalled that Lee \"just kept repeating herself.\" As a nurse herself, she had some experience with dementia.",
      "She marveled at the New York Times article with her letter in it.",
      "\"Just reading how Linde said, you know, she was easily diagnosed by inmates before any doctor diagnosed this condition. And I was just, thank you, Lord,\" Olson said. \"Thank you that something that I did would help this woman.\"",
      "Now, Jacobs has another partner in her fight to honor her mother and protect her daughters. She recently was invited to a gala in New York, with Anna Wintour of Vogue helping to lead fundraising.",

      "The new vaccine, mNexspike, is a step toward next-generation coronavirus vaccines. It's made in a way that allows for a lower dose - a fifth of the dose of its current COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax - by refining its immune target.",
      "The approval \"adds an important new tool to help protect people at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19,\" Stephane Bancel, Moderna's CEO, said in a statement Saturday.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved the new vaccine for use in adults 65 and older and people age 12 to 64 who have at least one health condition that puts them at increased risk from the coronavirus.",
      "That's the same limit the FDA set in licensing another COVID-19 vaccine option from competitor Novavax.",

      "Moderna's existing vaccine doesn't face those limits and has long been used for anyone ages 6 months and older. The company said it expected to offer both options this fall.",
      "The FDA's approval was based on a study of 11,400 people age 12 and older that compared the new low-dose vaccine with Moderna's existing vaccine. It found the new vaccine was safe and was at least as effective - and more by some measures - than the original shot, the company said.",

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",
      "\"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.",

      "\"Studies including hundreds of thousands of people around the world show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective, and beneficial to both the pregnant woman and the baby.

      "So far, the CDC's changes echo what the committee had already been considering voting on next month: narrowing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and younger ages with risk factors, but still allowing for permissive coverage of others getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has used \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance in the past to allow for federal requirements guaranteeing insurance coverage and access to some vaccines, while stopping short of full-throated recommendations for everyone eligible to get a shot.",

      "\"Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,\" the agency now says, in an update published Wednesday.",

      "After investigating 50 of those travelers, the CDC was able to determine that measles spread during air travel in at least one of those situations, the spokesperson said. That is usually based on connecting confirmed cases of measles among airline passengers sitting near each other.",
      "There have also been numerous public alerts in recent months about the possible risk of exposure in airports, after travelers were found to be contagious. \"Exposures at the airport itself are more difficult to track, and state, local, and territorial health departments lead these investigations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In its Wednesday update, the CDC dropped its list of countries now facing \"high incidence\" of measles. Instead, the agency now warns only that the virus is \"an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected.\"",
      "In addition to this year's record surge of the virus within the U.S., health authorities in neighboring Mexico and Canada have also reported large outbreaks of measles.",
      "The CDC also replaced a previous recommendation that Americans \"consider making alternative travel plans\" if they could not get vaccinated before departing, and now says travelers should \"consider postponing their trip.\"",
      "All travelers are recommended to be fully vaccinated for measles before going to any international destination. The CDC recently updated its guidance to doctors advising additional measles vaccines\u00a0for some domestic travelers as well.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As state officials anticipate Medicaid funding cuts that could strip resources for those with disabilities and chronic health conditions, an army of unpaid caregivers waits in the wings: children.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said.

    "story": [
      "With weather\u00a0forecasts\u00a0showing above-normal temperatures throughout the country this summer, heat-weary Americans will soon likely be turning up their air conditioners for relief. But that comfort will come at a cost.",
      "Home electricity bills\u00a0are expected to reach their highest average rate in 12 years, at $784 for the summer period, according to a recent analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The elevated cost comes as a one-two punch for families already financially strapped after this winter season's higher-than-average heating costs.",
      "Those most impacted by higher summer utility bills will be lower-income households, which often lack the resources to cover monthly payments. About one in four households say they can't pay their energy bills, according to the most recent Census Household Pulse Survey.",
      "The stakes for keeping cool are high. \"Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, resulting in hundreds of fatalities each year,\"\u00a0according to the National Weather Service. Higher temperatures can lead to heat stroke and heat exhaustion.",
      "Heat waves are\u00a0already hitting\u00a0parts of the U.S. like\u00a0Texas. As Mayo Clinic points out, unexpected fluctuations in the temperature often catch people off guard.",
      "For those looking for relief from high temperatures and high bills, experts offer helpful suggestions. \"There are simple things to do,\" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA. \"You can do them now, and they pay off.\"",
      "Here are tips to reduce your energy costs as summer heats up.",
      "Low-hanging fruit",
      "As a starting point, Americans can tackle low-hanging fruit options, like using a fan in place of, or in addition to an AC. Fans use far less electricity than air conditioners and are priced more reasonably, whether you're looking for a box fan, a pedestal fan or another model.",
      "For those with ceiling fans there's a hack for staying extra cool. Experts recommend setting ceiling fans to rotate counterclockwise during summer months, as doing so pushes warm air down and keeps a cool breeze going. In the fall and winter, rotation should be switched back to clockwise so that as warm air rises, it's circulated throughout the room, said Laurie Wheelock, executive director and counsel at New York's Utility Project (PULP).",
      "If you use an AC, make sure to change the air filter regularly. Wolfe recommends replacing AC filters monthly during the summer, to help units run more efficiently. For those who plan to keep their unit running during the day, you can set it to a few degrees higher before you leave your home to conserve energy.",
      "Wolfe advises setting your AC temperature between 70\u00b0F and 78\u00b0F when you are at home, and 78\u00b0F when the house is empty.",
      "Other small adjustments to keep your space cool include using indoor plants to create shade, keeping your curtains closed to block out the sunlight during the day, investing in reflective blinds or UV-reflective film for windows. Also, limit your oven use and make sure to turn it off right after using it, as it can warm up your space significantly, said Wolfe.",
      "For general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. Wolfe also recommends running your refrigerator and freezer at the regular temperature as directed by the manufacturer.",
      "\"Running them at cooler temperatures might seem like a good idea in the summer, but that can drive up electricity costs and potentially wear out the electrical appliance,\" he said.",
      "Also, make sure nothing is blocking the airflow of your heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Plant life or other obstacles in front of vents can make units less efficient, Wolfe noted.",
      "Look to your state or utility company for help",
      "While it may seem counter-intuitive, your utility company may be able to help you bear the cost burden of higher bills.",
      "\"Some utilities run programs to help make your home more energy efficient in the summer,\" said Wolfe. \"They'll offer rebates if you buy more efficient air conditioners, no-cost audits of your home, and they'll subsidize the cost of installing more insulation.\"",
      "In New York, for example, energy giants ConEd and National Grid have monthly discount programs that provide bill credits to low-income households. Wheelock said PULP has seen ConEd customers save $30 to $45 per month on gas an electricity as part of New York's Energy Affordability program, which is administered by the state's major electric and natural gas utilities.",
      "State governments can also be a useful resource. Depending on where you live, your local government may offer free home energy assessments, weatherization assistance or an energy efficiency program designs to help residents lower their electricity bill.",
      "For those struggling to make ends meet, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a federally funded initiative with a\u00a0network\u00a0of state-run programs, provides financial assistance to low-income households.",
      "HEAP provides eligible households, including apartments, with air conditioning units or fans, up to a value of $800, according to WE ACT for Environment Justice, a New York-based environmental justice organization.",
      "\"Anyone at risk of service termination who is low-income should contact their local Department of Social Services to discuss financial assistance programs including Emergency Energy Assistance,\" said Wheelock.",
      "Invest in long-term solutions",
      "With hotter temperatures here to stay, Wolfe said it may be worth investing in more permanent measures like improving your home's insulation or updating your ductwork. This will improve ventilation, keep cold air locked in and make your home more energy efficient overall.",
      "Another option is installing a smart thermostat, which allows you to remotely control the temperature of your space. They can also automatically adjust heating and cooling based on when you're home. Models like Ecobee's Smart Thermostat Essential or Google's Nest Smart Learning Thermostat typically run anywhere from $100 to $200.",
      "These investments may cost more upfront but will save you money over time, says Wolfe. \"In making your home more energy efficient, the savings will pay for the improvements,\" he said.",
      "For those ready to make an even bigger leap, installing a heat pump, switching to central air or upgrading your HVAC or AC system to one with a high Energy Star rating\u00a0are other long-term investments.",
      "Something to keep in mind before you make any of these purchases is whether electricity in your state is high enough to warrant the investment.",
      "\"If you're in like the northeast using heating oil, heat pumps make a lot of sense,\" said Wolfe.",
      "Even before you buy a home, it's worth investigating what the energy bills will look like. You can do this by getting an energy audit from a utility company, said Wolfe.",

      "GDP growth is forecast to slide to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year, a sharp reduction from the 2.8% growth recorded last year, according to the OECD, an international organization of 38 member countries that focuses on promoting economic growth.",
      "While the OECD's U.S. forecast didn't mention President Trump by name, the report cited new tariffs as one of the primary causes of the economic slowdown. The Trump administration's policies, which have introduced new import duties on almost every foreign nation, have hiked the effective tariff rate to 15.4% from 2% last year, marking the highest rate since 1938, the group said.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart, those costs are largely passed onto consumers in the form of higher costs \u2014 prompting the OECD to forecast that inflation in the U.S. will \"spike in mid-2025\" and reach 3.9% by the end of 2025.",
      "The Consumer Price Index rose by\u00a02.3% in April, as the tariffs largely hadn't yet impacted prices at that point.",
      "Without mentioning Mr. Trump, OECD chief economist \u00c1lvaro Pereira wrote in a commentary that accompanied the forecast that \"we have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment.''",
      "The report added that the U.S. is facing risks \"skewed to the downside, including a more substantial slowing of economic activity in the face of policy uncertainty, greater-than-expected upward pressure on prices from tariff increases, and large financial market corrections.\"",
      "World economic growth is also forecast to slow to 2.9% this year and stay there in 2026, according to the OECD's forecast. That would mark a substantial deceleration from growth of 3.3% global growth last year and 3.4% in 2023.",

      "Stocks of major U.S. steel companies jumped Monday after President Trump announced he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Cleveland-Cliffs steel manufacturer was up 25.2% in early morning trading. Nucor Corp., one of the nation's largest steel manufacturers, and Steel Dynamics, a steel producer and metals recycler, were both up 10%.",
      "The surge in steel stocks followed an announcement by Mr. Trump on Friday that he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum from the current rate of 25% to 50%. The 25% tariffs,\u00a0announced in February, were enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which gives the president authority to restrict imports he deems a national security threat. The new 50% tariffs are slated to take effect on June 4.",

      "Steel and aluminum prices jumped Monday, according to\u00a0Bloomberg. Automakers, which rely on steel and aluminum to produce vehicles, suffered early losses on Monday, with Ford shares falling 3.7% and General Motors dropping 4.1%.",

      "Mr. Trump in May announced a \"planned partnership\" between U.S. Steel and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel. Few details have emerged about what exactly the $14 billion deal will look like, although the White House has said it will create \"at least 70,000 jobs\" and that it will \"ensure steel is made in America for decades to come.\"",

      "The Trump administration's actions \"seriously undermine the existing consensus reached at the Geneva economic and trade talks, and seriously damage China's legitimate rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in the June 2 statement.",
      "China's claims come after President Trump on Friday said that Beijing is violating a trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after the two countries announced on May 12 a\u00a0temporary but significant easing\u00a0of tariffs imposed on each other's imports earlier in the year. The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",

      "May 12 tariff pause",

But the pause still leaves tariffs higher than before Mr. Trump\u00a0started ramping them up\u00a0last month. Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",
      "\"If the United States and China were to disengage completely in another blitz of escalating tariffs, it would be a really big deal for the global economy,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a client note. \"Demand for industrial commodities would plummet.

      "President Trump on Friday announced that the tariff on foreign steel will double from 25% to 50%, effective June 4, and accused Beijing of violating a recent trade agreement by withholding critical exports like rare earth minerals.",
      "\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Friday morning on his Truth Social app.",
      "He added, \"The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement is the latest in the tariff standoff, coming nearly two months after Mr. Trump announced \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on the U.S.' trading partners, eventually hiking the levy on Chinese to 145%. China responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. In May, the U.S. eased the tariff on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China agreed then to reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "Bessent on Sunday emphasized the White House's intention is not to \"decouple\" from China but to \"de-risk,\"and defended the new trade stance as essential to national and economic security.",
      "\"What China is doing is holding back products essential for industrial supply chains in India and Europe,\" Bessent said. \"That is not what a reliable partner does.\"",
      "Retailers, however, have sounded the alarm about the ripple effects of the ongoing U.S.-China trade standoff. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target have warned that high tariffs on imports from Asia could drive up prices for American consumers.",
      "Bessent addressed such warnings as speculative, highlighting companies who have opted not to raise prices.",
      "\"I know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying,\" he said. \"They're not raising prices. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration has identified sectors where Americans will feel the impact most, Bessent pointed to easing food and energy prices, and insisted that overall inflation is falling. \"Egg prices have collapsed,\" he said, crediting the administration's economic council and trade policies. Although egg prices have come down from the highest levels earlier this year, the Consumer Price Index showed in May that egg prices are still 49% higher than they were in May 2024.",
      "Despite industry concerns, Bessent argued Sunday that companies often offer worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to shield themselves from legal risk.",
      "\"They have to give the worst case,\" he said. \"Because if they haven't, and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 22:36:40 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced Friday he'll double steel tariffs from 25% to 50% during a visit at a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh area.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced that he would be doubling tariffs on steel to 50% as he visited a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh suburbs Friday, a week after teasing a \"planned partnership\" between the company and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel.",
      "\"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump later noted\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that the increase would also be applied to aluminum, and would take effect on June 4.",
      "The Nippon deal will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, according to Mr. Trump, who characterized the agreement last Sunday as \"an investment\" and \"partial ownership\" that will be \"controlled\" by the United States. The administration, however, has released few details about the deal.",
      "\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement last week was the latest twist in Nippon's yearslong effort to acquire U.S. Steel. Its nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden in January on national security grounds.",
      "Mr. Trump, who opposed the acquisition during the 2024 campaign, has since warmed to a deal between the steel producers, touting a $14 billion investment that the president said would \"create and save over 100,000 American jobs.\"",
      "\"You're going to be very happy,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"There's a lot of money coming your way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal includes \"vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.\" He added that U.S. Steel would also keep all of its blast furnace facilities at full capacity for at least the next decade and vowed that there would be \"no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.\" Every worker at U.S. Steel would soon be receiving a $5,000 bonus as well, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he approved a deal after the persistence of Nippon, whose offer kept getting \"better and better\" each time the company made another proposal.",
      "Later Friday night, after returning from his visit, Mr. Trump told reporters he has to approve the final deal with Nippon, and that \"we haven't seen that final deal yet.\"",
      "Sen. David McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, provided more details on the agreement in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., an arrangement that was also part of the deal rejected by Biden.",
      "McCormick did raise one potential difference in the latest iteration, stating that the U.S. would have a golden share.",
      "\"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\" McCormick said. \"There'll be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.\"",
      "McCormick said Nippon will have \"certainly members of the board, and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.\"",
      "\"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market \u2014 this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,\" McCormick said of Nippon. \"They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.\"",
      "It is not yet clear whether the golden share provision involves any U.S. ownership of the merged companies.",
      "The United Steelworkers union has opposed a sale, arguing that the Japanese company is making \"flashy promises\" that put American jobs at risk.",
      "In a statement Friday, union president David McCall said the group was not included or consulted in the discussions \"so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the 'planned partnership' between USS and Nippon or the 'golden share' that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.\"",
      "\"There is a vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing, just as there is a vast difference between allowing shareholders and executives to cash-out and putting workers' interests first,\" he said. \"Any final deal that may emerge from discussions between the merger parties and the federal government must be viewed through that lens, and not the lens of wishful thinking that has been adopted by far too many politicians and others.\"",
      "But without an acquisition, U.S. Steel had warned last year that the company would \"largely pivot away\" from its blast furnace facilities, which would put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The company said the future of its headquarters in Pittsburgh was also uncertain without an agreement.",
      "U.S. Steel employs about 22,000 people, with more than 14,000 employees in North America and the rest in Slovakia.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 20:47:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic in Las Vegas, but casual trips are down.",
    "story": [
      "Las Vegas \u2014 The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is usually the first stop for millions of tourists. But the line to snap a photo is noticeably shorter this spring as inflation, which has brought on higher prices for visitors, has hit \"Sin City\" hard.",
      "\"We were here last year, almost exactly the same time,\" John Fischer, who is visiting from the United Kingdom, told CBS News. \"And it was probably 20% more [expensive] this year.\"",
      "U.K. tourist Stuart Woodfall said he was surprised to pay $9 for a coffee.",
      "\"In the U.K., we pay 4 pounds, 5 pounds for a coffee? So yeah, crazy,\" Woodfall said.",
      "Those higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic, but casual trips are down. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said 3.39 million people visited in March, down 7.8% from the same time last year. April saw a 5.1% drop in visitors from April 2024.",
      "Hotel occupancy also slipped, as the average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip reached $203 in April, the LVCVA said, up from $194 at the same time last year. The hotel occupancy rate rate in April was 84.5%, down slightly from 85.5% in April of 2024.",
      "\"I think what's driving that largely now is just a drop in consumer confidence,\" Steve Hill, CEO and president of the LVCVA, told CBS News.",
      "Hill says big resorts can absorb a few empty rooms if the price is right.",
      "\"The philosophy in Las Vegas prior to the pandemic was, at any cost, fill a room,\" Hill said. \"Now, that has moderated somewhat. And so there is a balance point that they have found that is actually a little bit below the occupancy that we saw at a peak, which was about 88% in 2019. They're comfortable in that 85% range at a little higher price.\"",
      "Another sore spot is that Las Vegas is seeing fewer international visitors, Hill explains. They are the ones who generally tend to stay longer and spend more.",
      "\"It's an investment in a trip, and we're typically a bucket list,\" Hill said. \"They want to come here, spend more days, really enjoy the experiences that are here. And so when we lose them, we're losing a very valuable customer.\"",
      "Tourists who do roll the dice in Vegas are currently dealing with heavy vehicle traffic. Months of construction and road closures for special events can turn a 10-minute ride into a crawl on the Strip.",
      "\"We've had so many customers say, 'We're never coming back to this city, you can't get anywhere,'\" said Will Tryon, co-owner of Adventure Photo Tours, which he operates with his wife Donna Tryon. Their company does tours in the surrounding region, including the Grand Canyon, Area 51, Zion National Park and Death Valley.",
      "The couple said higher fuel and insurance costs leave little room to cut prices. Some tours priced at $75 before the COVID-19 pandemic are now $109.",
      "\"The economy, the money, they don't have the money to spend,\" Donna told CBS News. \"And the fact is that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation.\"",
      "Even so, plenty of visitors are still shelling out for hot tickets like Dead & Company's residency at the Sphere this spring, and Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter Tour, which is coming to Allegiant Stadium in July.",
      "\"It's like, you can go for the fancy experience, but then you can find a place that's a pretty good price,\" said Marc Kutzin, who is visiting from New York.",
      "The summer calendar is full of concerts, festivals and sporting events, and Hill believes the city will be resilient.",

    "summary": "President Trump has a number of options at his disposal to implement tariffs, but none are as broad and aggressive as IEEPA.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply county-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",
      "These tariffs differ from Section 301 levies in that the tariff rate is capped at 50%. Additionally, no formal investigation is required. The authority has never been used, according to experts.",

      "The investigation into the bitcoin torture case in New York City has revealed gruesome details about the alleged kidnapping and beating of an Italian man for his fortune in the cryptocurrency.",
      "What we know about the bitcoin torture case",
      "The unidentified 28-year-old man managed to escape from his alleged captors on May 23 in the affluent SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan, according to the New York Police Department. Bloodied and not wearing shoes, the man then found an NYPD traffic agent, who alerted police, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office.",
      "Two cryptocurrency investors, 37-year-old John Woeltz and 33-year-old William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment in the case. They're being held without bail. Attorneys for the suspects have declined to comment on the case.",
      "When investigators went through the SoHo town house where the man said he was held, they found a saw, crack cocaine, chicken wire, body armor, night-vision goggles, pictures of the man with a gun pointed to his head and ammunition, according to prosecutors.",
      "Woeltz, who is originally from Kentucky, was arrested when police went to the town house. Prosecutors said the large house has eight bedrooms and that Woeltz had the means to flee the jurisdiction if granted bail, with access to a private jet and a helicopter.",
      "Duplessie turned himself in to police on May 27, the NYPD said. His attorney said in court that Duplessie's involvement in the case is hotly disputed and he decided to turn himself in when he found out about Woeltz's arrest, CBS News New York reported.",
      "The Italian man arrived at the town house on May 6, according to prosecutors. The suspects are accused of previously threatening to have the man's family killed unless he paid them in bitcoin, and the suspects allegedly lured him to New York with an offer to return the bitcoin to him in person, prosecutors said.",
      "The suspects then allegedly held the man captive for over two weeks as they tried to get him to give up the password for his bitcoin wallet.",
      "During that time, the suspects are accused of shocking the man with electric wires, hitting him on the head with a gun and pointing a gun at his head several times, prosecutors said. An AirTag tracking device was tied around the man's neck, and the suspects allegedly told him they would find him if he left the house.",
      "Prosecutors also said the suspects allegedly hanged the man over the ledge of the building and threatened to kill him if he didn't give up his password. The suspects also allegedly threatened to have the man's family killed if he didn't give them what they wanted, prosecutors said.",
      "The man told authorities the suspects cut his leg with a saw, forced him to smoke crack cocaine and urinated on him during his captivity, according to prosecutors.",
      "\"To be tortured for 17 days in terms of a chain saw cutting your leg, in terms of putting your feet in water and electrocuting him, in terms of making the person ingest narcotics, horrible crime,\" NYPD Chief of Department John Chell, the police department's highest-ranking uniformed member, told CBS News New York.",
      "The man escaped after telling Woeltz he would give him the password, but it was on his laptop, prosecutors said. When Woeltz went to get the laptop, the man went downstairs and bolted from the house.",
      "Police sources told CBS News New York that two NYPD detectives did private security work for the suspects, but there isn't any indication that the detectives knew about the alleged kidnapping. One of the detectives picked up the Italian man at an airport and brought him to the SoHo town house, two sources told CBS News New York.",
      "The detectives were placed on desk duty May 28 and had their guns and badges taken from them pending an internal affairs investigation into the off-duty work, which the NYPD said wasn't authorized.",
      "One of the detectives was assigned to the security detail for New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\"Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty,\" Kayla Mamelak Altus, Adams' press secretary, said in a statement. \"We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.\"",

      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump's tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.",
      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

      "Mondelez International, the company behind Oreo, Wheat Thins and other name-brand products, says Aldi is copying its packaging in an effort to dupe customers into buying the supermarket chain's products.",
      "In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Illinois, the snack company alleges that Aldi \"blatantly copies\" the distinctive packaging of its brands in order to mislead customers into thinking they are buying a Mondelez product when they are actually purchasing a store-brand version. The company is seeking monetary damages and a court order that would prevent Aldi from selling products Mondelez says infringe on its trademarks.",
      "Neither Aldi nor Mondelez immediately responded to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Mondelez names a number of Aldi products in its lawsuit that it alleges are look-alikes of its own popular snacks such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins, Nilla Wafers cookies and Nabisco Premium Saltine Crackers. The company claims the Aldi store-brand items have different names but bear similar packaging design elements \u2014 including font, colors, image placement and product names \u2014 to Mondelez products.",
      "Aldi's Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies, for example, come in a red box, similar to that of Mondelez's Nutter Butter cookies. The white script font and cookie image on the packaging also mimic the Nutter Butter packaging, the snack company claims.",
      "Aldi also sells a product called Thin Wheat, which in addition to the nearly synonymous name to Nabisco's Wheat Thins, has a similar design to the Mondelez product, including a yellow background, the word \"original\" and crackers pictured on the bottom half of the box, the lawsuit says.",
      "The trademark lawsuit is not the first for Aldi, which been called out numerous times over its products' packaging. Earlier this year, a U.K. appeals court ruled in favor of Thatchers, a cider company, which sued Aldi over design similarities in the packaging of its lemon cider.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 16:04:33 -0400",
    "summary": "A rash of attacks on cryptocurrency owners is combining cybercrime with old-fashioned thuggery, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The recent case of an Italian tourist who was kidnapped in New York City and tortured by people allegedly after his cryptocurrency is drawing attention to a rash of crimes dubbed \"wrench attacks,\" which combine cybertheft with old-fashioned thuggery.",
      "The term stems from an XKCD comic that depicts a \"crypto nerd's imagination\" of the tech know-how that would be required to break into their digital wallet. In reality, the comic notes, all it would take is a heavy $5 wrench to threaten the crypto owner until they revealed their account password.",
      "Such attacks have picked up in recent months, partly because stealing a digital wallet can be easier than stealing money from a traditional bank account, said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, a crypto tracing firm. On top of that, the value of bitcoin has surged in recent months, making people with crypto holdings potentially lucrative targets for criminals.",
      "\"Criminals go to where the money is, and we're seeing a huge rise in the price of bitcoin,\" Redbord said. \"Before, you needed sophisticated cyber capabilities to hack someone, but now you can be a violent criminal who can beat [the password] out of someone.\"",
      "He added, \"I don't think I've ever been as taken aback by this type of illicit activity in crypto.\"",
      "The crypto world also has a culture of flaunting wealth via social media posts or appearances at crypto conference, which allows criminals to easily identify potential targets.",
      "Bitcoin traded Friday at nearly $105,000 per token, according to CoinDesk \u2014 about 53% higher than a year ago. The digital currency has soared partly as people seek alternatives to put their money than traditional investments like stocks and bonds, and as the Trump administration takes steps to promote the use of cryptocurrencies, including establishing a \"strategic crypto reserve.\"",
      "How to crack a wallet",
      "Cryptocurrency thefts aren't new, but they've typically involved hacking, such as a massive 2022 hack at crypto exchange Binance\u00a0in which thieves initially stole $570 million, as well as multiple hacks by entities the United Nations found were linked to North Korea.",
      "In response to such threats, crypto owners often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \"cold wallets.\" When used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But criminals have realized they don't need any technical skills to steal crypto assets, Redbord said. All it takes is gaining access to a person's crypto account password, because there's no third-party financial institution standing in the way of accessing funds held in a digital wallet, he explained.",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don't need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "NYC crypto kidnapping",
      "The case in New York City is somewhat unusual because it involves crypto investors allegedly trying to steal the assets of another investor, Redbord said.",
      "In that case, investors John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, face\u00a0charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment of the Italian tourist in an effort to steal his digital wallet containing bitcoin worth millions of dollars. Court papers allege that the pair held the unidentified 28-year-old victim for weeks in an apartment in New York City's fashionable Soho neighborhood.",
      "After the victim was abducted, he was shocked with electric wires, his leg was cut with a saw and he was forced to smoke crack cocaine, prosecutors allege. Items including a photo of a gun held to the Italian tourist's head were found in the apartment by investigators.",
      "Two New York City police detectives had been working security for the accused kidnappers, CBS News New York has reported. The detective have been placed on desk duty as police investigate.",
      "Such incidents have also occurred with increasing frequency in Europe and Asia. Several cases in France have mirrored the New York City attack, with French police arresting 20 people following several alleged kidnapping plots involving crypto investors and their families, the BBC reported earlier this week.",
      "In one case, a gang allegedly tried to kidnap the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency company executive in Paris, while earlier this month the father of a crypto millionaire was rescued by police in Paris after he was kidnapped and held for ransom.",
      "Aside from keeping a lower profile, crypto investors can take other steps to make it tougher for criminals, Redbord said. One option is to require permissions from several people to access a wallet, for instance.",
      "In the meantime, criminals are taking note and may be pursuing similar crimes, he added. \"They are seeing successes and trying to replicate these successes,\" Redbord said.",

    "story": [
      "Counselors who work with foreign students eager to attend college in the U.S. are advising them to purge their social media accounts of posts that could attract the attention of U.S. State Department officials.",
      "\"Any new student who comes on board \u2014 especially an international student who doesn't have a U.S. passport \u2014 we would be going through their social media with them and talk to them about what they are saying on Snapchat, in group chats,\" said Kat Cohen, founder and CEO of IvyWise, an educational consultancy firm for college admissions. \"Because, if the information comes off as being radical or anti-American in some way, it is not going to help them.\"",
      "The focus on international students' online profiles follows a new push by the Trump administration to scrutinize social media accounts as part of the evaluation process for student visa applications. In a cable dated May 27 and obtained by CBS News, the State Department said it was preparing to expand social media screening and vetting. The agency did not specify exactly what type of content it would be looking for.",
      "\"President Trump will always put the safety of Americans first, and it is a privilege, not a right, to study in the United States,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \"Enhanced social media vetting is a commonsense measure that will help ensure that guests in our country are not planning to harm Americans, which is a national security priority.\"",
      "The new vetting measures build upon an April\u00a0statement\u00a0from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announcing that the agency will be taking into account \"antisemitic activity on social media\" as \"grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.\"",
      "No politics",
      "Advisers who cater to international students applying to U.S. schools told CBS Moneywatch they are reluctant to advise them to delete their social media accounts outright. But they are urging students to eliminate political-themed posts, especially if they relate to controversial topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. IvyWise also discourages foreign students from reposting any information they haven't verified themselves, given that it might be inaccurate.",
      "\"We don't think students should delete their social media accounts completely,\" Cohen said. \"But we do need to make sure we go through their social media accounts with them to make sure that they are presenting themselves in the best possible light.\"",
      "Mandee Heller Adler, founder of International College Counselors, also recommends that students weed out potentially controversial posts, including any opinions or content related to politics.",
      "\"I'm not saying that they have to get rid of the whole thing altogether, but certainly delete any political posts,\" Adler told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is kind of an easy way for kids to protect themselves.\"",
      "Sasha Chada, who has led Texas-based college admissions counseling group Ivy Scholars for over a decade, said that asking students to delete their social media would be a \"tall order\" given how deeply ingrained the platforms are in their lives. People aged 18 to 24, for example, make up the largest share of Instagram users worldwide, at 32%, according to Sprout Social, a social media management platform.",
      "Chilling effect?",
      "Some critics think the State Department's scrutiny of international students' social accounts will inhibit their freedom of expression.",
      "\"While social media vetting of visa applicants isn't new, should the administration's 'expanded vetting' consider political viewpoints, it will certainly scare some would-be applicants into silencing themselves on any topic they feel might contradict the views of President Trump, or his successors,\" said Robert Shibley, special counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which promotes free speech on college campuses.",
      "The State Department did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters this week, when asked about student visas.",
      "Mahsa Khanbabai, an immigration attorney based in Massachusetts whose firm assists with student visas, said she has spoken to dozens of foreign students \u2014 both overseas and in the U.S. \u2014 some of whom have decided to delete their social media accounts or change them from public to private for protection.",
      "Students, she said, are not just concerned about posts on political flashpoints like Gaza, but also their personal views on topics like climate change and reproductive rights advocacy. Recent consultations Khanbabai has had with foreign students have been focused, she said, on helping them determine how strongly they feel about publicizing their views, and giving them a sense of the potential trade-offs when deciding to post or not to post.",
      "\"I meet with students to ask them, 'Are you willing to pause engagement on social media to achieve longer-term goals like your career and education, knowing that in the short term you're ultimately kind of maybe sacrificing some of your ethical or moral values?'\" she said.",

      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" Desai said. \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",
      "Later, in a June 3 order, the judge agreed to pause his decision while the Trump administration pursues an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Citing the stay issued by the Federal Circuit in the other cases, Contreras wrote that similar action in the legal battle before him is \"therefore appropriate to protect the President's ability to identify and respond to threats to the U.S. economy and national security.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Jun 2025 20:59:50 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's domestic policy legislation the House advanced in May includes a substantial rollback of the Affordable Care Act.",
    "story": [
      "Millions would lose Medicaid coverage. Millions would be left without health insurance. Signing up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces would be harder and more expensive.",
      "President Trump's domestic policy legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that cleared the House in May and now moves to the Senate, could also be called Obamacare Repeal Lite, its critics say. In addition to causing millions of Americans to lose their coverage under Medicaid, the health program for low-income and disabled people, the measure includes the most substantial rollback of the ACA since Mr. Trump's Republican allies tried to pass legislation in 2017 that would have largely repealed President Barack Obama's signature domestic accomplishment.",
      "One difference today is that Republicans aren't describing their legislation as a repeal of the ACA, after the 2017 effort cost them control of the House the following year. Instead, they say the bill would merely reduce \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" in Medicaid and other government health programs.",
      "\"In a way, this is their ACA repeal wish list without advertising it as Obamacare repeal,\" said Philip Rocco, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University in Milwaukee and co-author of the book \"Obamacare Wars: Federalism, State Politics, and the Affordable Care Act.\"",
      "The GOP, Rocco said, learned eight years ago that the \"headline of Obamacare repeal is really bad politics.\"",
      "Democrats have tried to frame Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act as an assault on Americans' health care, just as they did with the 2017 legislation.",
      "\"They are essentially repealing parts of the Affordable Care Act,\" Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) said as the House debated the measure in May. \"This bill will destroy the health care system of this country.\"",
      "Nearly two-thirds of adults have a favorable view of the ACA, according to polling by KFF, a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "In contrast, about half of people polled also say there are major problems with waste, fraud, and abuse in government health programs, including Medicaid, KFF found.",
      "\"We are not cutting Medicaid,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said May 25 on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" describing the bill's changes as affecting only immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization and \"able-bodied workers\" whom he claimed are on Medicaid but don't work.",
      "The program is \"intended for the most vulnerable populations of Americans, which is pregnant women and young single mothers, the disabled, the elderly,\" he said. \"They are protected in what we're doing because we're preserving the resources for those who need it most.\"",
      "The 2025 legislation wouldn't cut as deeply into health programs as the failed 2017 bill, which would have led to about 32 million Americans losing insurance coverage, the Congressional Budget Office estimated\u00a0at the time. By contrast, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with provisions that affect Medicaid and ACA enrollees, would leave nearly 9 million more people without health insurance by 2034, according to the CBO.",
      "That number rises to nearly 14 million if Congress doesn't extend premium subsidies for Obamacare plans that were enhanced during the pandemic to help more people buy insurance on government marketplaces, the CBO says. Without congressional action, the more generous subsidies will expire at the end of the year and most ACA enrollees will see their premiums rise sharply.",
      "The increased financial assistance led to a record 24 million people enrolled in ACA marketplace plans this year, and health insurance experts predict a large reduction without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Loss of those enhanced subsidies, coupled with other changes set in the House bill, will mean \"the ACA will still be there, but it will be devastating for the program,\" said Katie Keith, founding director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University.",
      "Republicans argue that ACA subsidies are a separate issue from the One Big Beautiful Bill and accused Democrats of conflating them.",
      "The House-passed bill also makes a number of ACA changes, including shortening by a month the annual open enrollment period and eliminating policies from Joe Biden's presidency that allowed many low-income people to sign up year-round.",
      "New paperwork hurdles the House bill creates are also expected to result in people dropping or losing ACA coverage, according to the CBO.",
      "For example, the bill would end most automatic reenrollment, which was used by more than 10 million people this year. Instead, most ACA enrollees would need to provide updated information, including on income and immigration status, to the federal and state ACA marketplaces every year, starting in August, well before open enrollment.",
      "Studies show that additional administrative hurdles lead to people dropping coverage, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.",
      "\"Not only do people drop out of the process, but it tends to be healthier, younger, lower-income folks who drop out,\" she said. \"That's dumb because they go uninsured. Also, it is bad for the insurance market.\"",
      "Supporters of the provision say it's necessary to combat fraudulent enrollment by ensuring that ACA beneficiaries still want coverage every year or that they are not being enrolled without their permission by rogue sales agents. Most of the Medicaid coverage reductions in the bill, the CBO says, are due to new work requirements and directives for the 21 million adults added to the program since 2014 under an expansion authorized by the ACA.",
      "One new requirement is that those beneficiaries prove their eligibility every six months, instead of once a year, the norm in most states.",
      "That would add costs for states and probably lead to people who are still eligible falling off Medicaid, said Oregon Medicaid Director Emma Sandoe. Oregon has one of the most liberal continuous eligibility policies, allowing anyone age 6 or older to stay on for up to two years without reapplying.",
      "Such policies help ensure people don't fall off for paperwork reasons and reduce administrative burden for the state, Sandoe said. Requiring more frequent eligibility checks would \"limit the ability of folks to get care and receive health services, and that is our primary goal,\" Sandoe said.",
      "The 2017 repeal effort was aimed at fulfilling Mr. Trump's promises from his first presidential campaign. That's not the case now. The health policy provisions of the House bill instead would help to offset the cost of extending about $4 trillion in tax cuts that skew toward wealthier Americans.",
      "The Medicaid changes in the bill would reduce federal spending on the program by about $700 billion over 10 years. CBO has not yet issued an estimate of how much the ACA provisions would save.",
      "Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said Republican efforts to make it harder for what they term \"able-bodied\" adults to get Medicaid is code for scaling back Obamacare.",
      "The ACA's Medicaid expansion has been adopted by 40 states and Washington, D.C. The House bill's work requirement and added eligibility checks are intended to drive off Medicaid enrollees who Republicans believe never should have been on the program, McBride said. Congress approved the ACA in 2010 with no Republican votes.",
      "Most adult Medicaid enrollees under 65 are already working, studies show. Imposing requirements that people prove they're working, or that they're exempt from having to work, to stay on Medicaid will lead to some people losing coverage simply because they don't fill out paperwork, researchers say.",
      "Manatt Health estimates that about 30% of people added to Medicaid through the ACA expansion would lose coverage, or about 7 million people, said Jocelyn Guyer, senior managing director of the consulting firm.",
      "The bill also would make it harder for people enrolled under Medicaid expansions to get care, because it requires states to charge copayments of up to $35 for some specialist services for those with incomes above the federal poverty level, which is $15,650 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Today, copayments are rare in Medicaid, and when states charge them, they're typically nominal, usually under $10. Studies show cost sharing in Medicaid leads to worse access to care among beneficiaries.",
      "Christopher Pope, a senior fellow with the conservative Manhattan Institute, acknowledged that some people will lose coverage but rejected the notion that the GOP bill amounts to a full-on assault on the ACA.",
      "He questioned the coverage reductions forecast by the CBO, saying the agency often struggles to accurately predict how states will react to changes in law. He said that some states may make it easy for enrollees to satisfy new work requirements, reducing coverage losses.",
      "By comparison, Pope said, the ACA repeal effort from Mr. Trump's first term a decade ago would have ended the entire Medicaid expansion. \"This bill does nothing to stop the top features of Obamacare,\" Pope said.",
      "But McBride said that while the number of people losing health insurance under the GOP bill is predicted to be less than the 2017 estimates, it would still eliminate about half the ACA's coverage gains, which brought the U.S. uninsured rate to historical lows. \"It would take us backwards,\" he said.",

A federal air marshal was sent to covertly travel near them on a flight on Oct. 18, 2023, one source said.",
      "Sen. Shaheen spoke with Pekoske to ask about the situation regarding her husband. On Oct. 20, 2023, her husband was added to the \"secure flight exclusion list,\" a VIP list that exempts a traveler from the security agency's vetting and surveillance programs, including random screenings.",

      "The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from getting work permits, potentially upending longstanding U.S. immigration policy, two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News.",
      "A proposal by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would amount to an indefinite pause on the U.S. government's decades-old policy of allowing migrants with pending asylum claims to work in the country lawfully while their cases are decided, the DHS officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
      "The proposed changes \u2014 which have not been previously reported \u2014 would add yet another layer to President Trump's government-wide immigration crackdown, targeting a massively backlogged asylum system that his top aides have argued is being systematically exploited by economic migrants.",

      "Since the 1990s, U.S. law has allowed immigration officials to grant work permits to asylum applicants if their cases have been pending for at least 180 days. Generally speaking, that has allowed asylum applicants to request a work permit 150 days after they make their claim. Those eligible can be granted the permit after another 30 days.",
      "But a regulation under internal consideration by the Trump administration would suspend the issuance of new work permits to asylum-seekers until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, the DHS officials said.",
      "That timeframe would be exceedingly difficult to meet in the near future, given massive case backlogs and operational constraints. Last year, for example, a federal government watchdog found that over 77% of the asylum applications before USCIS had been pending for beyond 180 days. Nearly 40% of applications remained unresolved after two years.",
      "Even if the 180-day processing average is reached, the proposal would require asylum-seekers to wait one year until after they file their application \u2014 instead of six months \u2014 to be eligible for a work permit, the DHS officials said.",
      "It's unclear when the regulation may be publicly announced, or if it will be altered before being finalized.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said it does not comment on the \"deliberative process or possible decision making.\"",
      "\"Over the previous four years, the Biden administration eviscerated the integrity of America's asylum system. The Department is exploring all possible options to protect our national security and increase program integrity,\" DHS said in its statement. \"DHS is working to mitigate all forms of fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The changes under consideration by the Trump administration would apply to asylum seekers with pending applications sent to USCIS and those in deportation proceedings before the immigration courts, which are overseen by the Justice Department.",
      "Asylum can be granted to foreigners on U.S. soil who prove they are fleeing persecution due to their nationality, race, religion, political views or membership in a social group. While factors like nationality and legal representation play a key role, many applicants do not ultimately meet the high legal threshold to win asylum, government figures show.",
      "Still, over the past decade, amid record arrivals of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, the number of asylum applications has ballooned. USCIS is overseeing roughly 1.5 million asylum applications, while the immigration courts are reviewing another 2 million, according to government data.",
      "The plan under consideration would seek to eliminate what Trump administration officials have described as a magnet for migrants using the asylum system simply to work in the U.S. It echoes a 2020 rule issued by the first Trump administration that sought to increase the waiting period for asylum applicants requesting work authorization from six months to a year and impose other restrictions on eligibility for work permits.",
      "The proposed rule would also be the latest step taken by the second Trump administration to make the U.S. inhospitable for asylum-seekers.",
      "Immediately after returning to the White House in January, President Trump all but closed the U.S. asylum system, giving border agents the power to summarily deport most migrants on the grounds the country is facing an \"invasion.\" That emergency order is being challenged by pro-immigrant advocates, who say it ignores American asylum law.",
      "Conchita Cruz, the co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a group that supports those with asylum claims, said efforts to curtail work permits for the migrants she serves would hurt U.S. communities and employers.",
      "\"Asylum seekers are playing critical roles in a wide array of jobs \u2014 they are the doctors and the people cleaning the hospitals,\" Cruz said.",

    "summary": "U.S. Navy is renaming a ship named for gay rights leader Harvey Milk and considering new names for others named for prominent Americans.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The U.S. Navy plans to rename the\u00a0USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler\u00a0named after\u00a0the slain gay rights leader and Navy veteran, and is considering renaming multiple naval ships named after civil rights leaders and prominent American voices, CBS News has learned.",
      "U.S. Navy documents obtained by CBS News and used to brief the secretary of the Navy and his chief of staff show proposed timelines for rolling out the name change of the USNS Harvey Milk to the public. While the documents do not say what the ship's new name would be, the proposal comes during Pride Month, the monthlong observance of the LGBTQ+ community that also coincides with the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising of 1969. WorldPride celebrations are being held in Washington, D.C., this year.",
      "The documents obtained by CBS News also show other vessels named after prominent leaders are also on the Navy's renaming \"recommended list.\"",
      "Among them are the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, USNS Harriet Tubman, USNS Dolores Huerta, USNS Lucy Stone, USNS Cesar Chavez and USNS Medgar Evers.",
      "CBS News found that a December 2024 web article from Naval Sea Systems Command about the laying of the keel for the future USNS Thurgood Marshall has been deleted.",
      "\"The reported decision by the Trump Administration to change the names of the USNS Harvey Milk and other ships in the John Lewis-class is a shameful, vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American Dream,\" Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi told CBS News in a statement.",
      "She added, \"Our military is the most powerful in the world \u2013 but this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the 'warrior' ethos. Instead, it is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News the move was \"an utter abomination in terms of the extreme MAGA Republican effort to continue to erase American history, and we're not going to allow it to happen.\" And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on X that Hegseth \"should be ashamed of himself and reverse this immediately.\"",
      "Following his confirmation in January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a\u00a0directive instructing the Pentagon and U.S. military services to cease hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months, citing concerns that such programs could undermine unity within the ranks. The \"Identity Months Dead at DoD\" guidance banned official manpower and resources from being used on such events \u2014 among them, Pride Month, Black History Month and Women's History Month.",
      "The documents obtained by CBS News were not marked with the traditional classification markers typically seen on Defense Department memos. The documents were not marked as \"For Official Use Only\" or \"Controlled Unclassified Information,\" they were also not marked to indicate they were drafts. There was a \"CAUTION\" note, however, referring to the information as publicly sensitive.",
      "The memo said the renaming of naval ships was to realign the U.S. military with Trump administration priorities of \"reestablishing the warrior culture.\"",
      "The documents call for Navy Secretary John Phelan to select a new name for the USNS Harvey Milk on Tuesday, with the notice of the name change going out to other senior U.S. Navy officials later in the week after undergoing legal review.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Hegseth \"is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief's priorities, our nation's history, and the warrior ethos.\" Parnell added that any potential renaming decisions would be announced once the internal reviews are complete. Military.com first reported the name change for the USNS Harvey Milk on Tuesday, but the news of other naval vessels being considered for a name change has not yet been reported.",
      "The USNS Harvey Milk is a John Lewis-class replenishment oiler, designed to support carrier strike groups at sea. The class of ships is named after civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis, who died in 2020.",
      "Harvey Milk, the political trailblazer, emerged in the 1970s as one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. After years of activism, he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, where he quickly became a national symbol of LGBTQ+ political empowerment. His life was cut short in 1978 when he was assassinated in City Hall, alongside Mayor George Moscone.",
      "The USNS Harvey Milk was christened in 2021 and represented a significant step toward inclusivity within the armed forces.",
      "Before he emerged as one of the most visible advocates for gay rights in American history, Milk served in the U.S. Navy. From 1952 to 1954, he held posts as an operations and dive officer aboard two submarine rescue ships \u2014 the USS Chanticleer and the USS Kittiwake \u2014 both active during the Korean War, according to the U.S. National Archives.",
      "But his sexual orientation carried profound consequences as Milk came under scrutiny. In December 1954, Milk, who was then a lieutenant junior grade, was facing a court martial for participating in a \"homosexual act\" a year earlier.",
      "Instead of facing trial, Milk was drummed out of the U.S. military, like so many other gay service members of his era. In January 1954, he resigned his commission and accepted an \"Other Than Honorable\" discharge. In 2021, the Navy approached Milk's nephew, Stuart Milk, to see if he wanted his uncle's discharge upgraded, according to NPR. Stuart decided against it as a reminder that not everyone was treated with honor.",
      "The name change would follow two base renamings Hegseth directed earlier this year to reverse the work a congressionally mandated naming commission did to remove names honoring the Confederacy. In February, he directed Fort Liberty in North Carolina return to Fort Bragg, saying it would now be named after a non-Confederate Bragg, and then directed Fort Moore change to Fort Benning, after another Benning.",
      "The naming commission also suggested the Navy rename the guided missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville, which honors a Confederate battle victory, to the USS Robert Smalls, to recognize a slave who stole a Confederate ship and surrendered it to the Union. The Navy also renamed the USNS Maury to the USNS Marie Tharp, removing the name of a Confederate sailor and replacing it with the name of a pioneering female oceanographer.",
      "Although the Navy has renamed ships for various reasons, name changes are still an exceptionally rare occurrence, especially after the ships have entered service.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is threatening California with steep fines and legal action days after a transgender athlete won two statewide high school track-and-field events, ramping up the legal threats aimed at the state over transgender issues.",
      "The student, AB Hernandez, a transgender 16-year-old, won both the high school girls' high jump and triple jump at a California state track meet on Saturday, after competing under new rules that allowed more girls to compete and medal in events in which Hernandez participated.",
      "Before the competition, California Interscholastic Foundation, the independent non-profit organization that runs the state's high school sports, started a \"pilot entry process\" that allowed additional female students to participate in the championship meet. The new rules also resulted in Hernandez sharing the gold medal podium with two other students in a shared first place win in one event. The new policy only applied to events that Hernandez participated in.",
      "However, in a letter sent Monday to California public school districts and the CIF, Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, called CIF policies allowing transgender athletes to compete \"unconstitutional.\" She alleged that \"knowingly depriving female students of athletic opportunities and benefits on the basis of their sex would constitute unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause\" of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Dhillon ordered the CIF to inform the Justice Department by June 9 that it will no longer implement a bylaw covering transgender athletes, alleging it violates the rights of female athletes.",
      "The CIF rule criticized by Dhillon's letter requires California public high schools to allow all students to participate in sports \"in a manner that is consistent with their gender identities, irrespective of the gender listed on a student's records.\"",
      "The letter does not mention Hernandez. But on Tuesday morning, President Trump singled out Hernandez in a\u00a0post on Truth Social, his social media site, and said that \"large scale fines\" will be imposed on the state.",

      "In an interview with the news outlet Capital & Main, Hernandez said that she is not worried about the criticism, both national and local, aimed at her.",
      "\"I'm still a child, you're an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,\" Hernandez told the publication.",
      "A spokesperson for California Attorney General Rob Bonta said that the office is \"reviewing the letter and closely monitoring the Trump Administration's actions in this space.\"",
      "\"We're very concerned with the Trump Administration's ongoing threats to California schools and remain committed to defending and upholding California laws and all additional laws which ensure the rights of students \u2014 including transgender students \u2014 to be free from discrimination and harassment,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for the CIF did not respond to immediate requests for comment.",
      "Last month, the Justice Department announced that it was investigating California high school sports after it allowed the student to compete at the track and field championships. The Trump administration has already sued Maine over what it alleges is a violation of an executive order attempting to ban transgender women and girls from women's sports.",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the criticism during the daily press briefing, telling reporters that Mr. Trump \"already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn't change the president's opinion.\"",
      "Musk told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in a recent interview that he was \"disappointed\" by the price tag of the measure, which passed the House before Memorial Day after Mr. Trump stepped up pressure on the Republican holdouts to fall in line. Musk said the package increases the deficit and undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk told CBS News, \"but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House on Tuesday sent a formal request to Congress to claw back funding for NPR, PBS and international aid that lawmakers had previously approved.",
      "The package would cancel $9.4 billion appropriated by Congress, aiming to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts. It focuses on slashing foreign aid, along with major public broadcasting entities, including NPR and PBS.",
      "The $9.4 billion rescissions package includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS. In April, the White House released a statement saying taxpayers had funded the two entities \"for too long\" and said they've \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\" PBS received $325 million in CPB funding this year.",
      "The package also requests $8.3 billion in cuts to the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The foreign aid agency became a target of the administration, which worked to shutter it earlier this year. And Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought has argued that the foreign aid is not only wasteful, but that USAID has been pushing \"weaponized cultural indoctrination\" in other countries.",
      "Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The president can temporarily defer funds or withhold them altogether \u2014 but only with Congress' approval.",
      "The rescission process allows Congress to cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent but has previously appropriated. And only discretionary funds can be rescinded, while mandatory spending, like Social Security and Medicare, cannot be.",
      "In the Senate, rescission bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber. Instead, they only require a simple majority.",
      "The White House's Office of Management and Budget's rescission request kickstarts a process that gives Congress 45 days to act. First, the request goes before relevant committees for consideration, before moving to the full House and Senate for votes.",
      "Republicans in Congress have been eager to get started on the rescission process, as deficit hawks rail against Washington's spending habits. And House Speaker Mike Johnson has pledged the House will \"act quickly by passing legislation to codify the cuts.\"",
      "\"The House is eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings so we can deliver even more cuts to big government that President Trump wants and the American people demand,\" Johnson said last week in a post on X.",
      "But whether Republican leaders can successfully maneuver the package through Congress remains to be seen. While rescission has frequently been used in Congress to reallocate unspent funds, requests from the White House come less frequently. And during the first Trump administration, the Senate rejected a rescission package sent by the White House requesting nearly $15 billion in cuts.",
      "Meanwhile, fiscal hawks in Congress have been advocating for rescission to cut down on costs while a major legislative package key to Mr. Trump's agenda makes its way through Congress. That legislation, titled One Big Beautiful Bill, would allocate funding for tax cuts, border security and defense. But the price tag for that package, which at this point could add around $3 trillion to the national debt, dwarfs what lawmakers would get back from the rescission package.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has been a vocal opponent of additional spending and especially a plan to raise the debt ceiling as part of the tax cut legislation, backs the rescission package, calling the funds \"the low-hanging fruit.\" But he, too, noted that the impact on the deficit would be minuscule.",
      "\"This is very, very small,\" Paul said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"It really doesn't materially change the course of the country.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled Tuesday that the federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to transgender inmates while they pursue a legal challenge to President Trump's executive order that sought to restrict access to the treatments.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth granted a request for a preliminary injunction sought by three transgender inmates who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and were provided with hormone therapy and certain lifestyle accommodations, such as clothing and hair removal devices, during their incarceration.",
      "The inmates filed their lawsuit after Mr. Trump issued an executive order on his first day back in the White House that kept federal funds from being spent on any medical procedure or treatment meant to confirm an inmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex.",
      "They asked the district court in Washington to block implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order while their lawsuit proceeds, arguing that the directive and the Bureau of Prison's actions implementing it violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process, the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "Lamberth agreed, and ruled that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. The judge blocked administration officials from enforcing the president's executive order as it relates to hormone therapy and social accommodations for people in custody of the Bureau of Prisons and directed them to continue providing transgender inmates with gender-affirming care and certain accommodations, as was the bureau's policy before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"The import of the opinion is essentially this: Under the APA, the BOP may not arbitrarily deprive inmates of medications or other lifestyle accommodations that its own medical staff have deemed to be medically appropriate without considering the implications of that decision,\" Lamberth, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote in a 36-page opinion.",
      "The case before Lamberth is one of several brought by transgender inmates in response to Mr. Trump's executive actions. In the wake of the president's order regarding gender-affirming care for inmates, the Bureau of Prisons issued memoranda that barred federal dollars from being used to \"purchase any items that align with transgender ideology\" or provide gender-affirming care for transgender inmates. The bureau also clarified that requests for clothing accommodations will be denied.",
      "The three plaintiffs in the case were in custody of the Bureau of Prisons when the directives were issued and filed their lawsuit in March. They had been prescribed hormone therapy and were approved to receive social accommodations, including undergarments and hygiene products. But on the heels of Mr. Trump's executive order, they were informed their treatments would be discontinued, though their access to the medical care has since been restored.",
      "The transgender inmates asked the court to issue relief in mid-March and sought to certify a class consisting of all incarcerated people in the Bureau of Prisons' custody who will be or have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and receive the gender-affirming care targeted by Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Lamberth rejected the Trump administration's contention that it will suffer a financial burden if required to continue providing certain gender-affirming care to inmates. He noted that the Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to 600 incarcerated people who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "\"The only deleterious public effect of the court's injunction will be to require that, during the pendency of litigation, the BOP will continue to shoulder a certain administrative cost that it has already willingly assumed since the commencement of this action, and that it had voluntary borne for many years prior,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge also said that neither the Bureau of Prisons nor Mr. Trump's executive order provided a \"serious explanation\" as to why medical treatment for gender dysphoria should be handled differently than other mental health interventions.",
      "\"Nothing in the thin record before the court suggests that either the BOP or the president consciously took stock of \u2014 much less studied \u2014 the potentially debilitating effects that the new policies could have on transgender inmates before the implementing memoranda came into force,\" Lamberth found.",
      "The Justice Department is likely to appeal the decision. It is the latest in a slew of rulings from trial court judges that have blocked many aspects of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda.",

The passport handed in had a serial number ending in \"1332.\" A warrant for Gao was later issued after he missed court hearings on March 6 and April 24.",
      "The FBI said in the filing that Gao's passport was in the possession of school safety officials during a court hearing.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is forging ahead this week on President Trump's \"one big beautiful bill,\" facing a tight, self-imposed deadline to get the legislation to his desk ahead of the July 4 holiday.",
      "\"It's going to be a busy month \u2014 we have a lot to get done,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on the Senate floor Monday, adding that the upper chamber's \"biggest focus\" will be on getting the president's agenda passed.",
      "In a razor-thin vote last month, the House passed the legislation, which addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities. The vote came after weeks of intraparty disagreement over a number of provisions, like Medicaid restrictions. That bill has now made its way to the Senate, where some of the same tensions exist \u2014 and new dynamics have begun to take shape.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, outlined to reporters Monday that the process is underway, saying \"I think we're on track \u2014 I hope, at least \u2014 to be able to produce something that we can pass through the Senate, send back to the House, have them pass and put on the president's desk by the Fourth of July.\"",
      "But Thune can only afford to lose three Republican votes on the bill, with all Democrats expected to vote against it. A handful of Senate Republicans have already expressed opposition to the House-passed bill. GOP leaders will be focused on uniting the conference around the bill, and possible changes, in the days ahead.",
      "The majority leader acknowledged the delicate balance on Monday, telling reporters that the Senate bill will \"have to be tracked fairly closely, obviously, with the House bill,\" citing its \"fragile majority.\" Thune said the House \"struck a very delicate balance in getting it passed in the House in the first place.\"",
      "\"But there are some things that senators want, you know, added to the bill, or, you know, things that we would do slightly differently,\" Thune said.",
      "Meanwhile, the president took an active role in the process as the Senate returned to Washington from recess on Monday. He met with Thune and spoke with a handful of key Senate Republicans, including Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Josh Hawley of Missouri, who have expressed opposition to some of the bill's components.",
      "Johnson, along with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been among the leading voices in the upper chamber calling for deeper spending cuts in the bill, which aims at present to cut $1.5 trillion, while also advocating for separating a debt ceiling increase from the legislation.",
      "The Wisconsin Republican said he had a \"very respectful conversation\" with Mr. Trump, telling reporters that he and the president \"by and large share the same goal,\" but have a \"difference in opinion in terms of how to do it.\"",
      "Paul has pledged to oppose the bill due to its debt ceiling increase. Mr. Trump again called out the Kentucky Republican on Truth Social on Tuesday, saying Paul \"votes NO on everything, but never has any practical or constructive ideas.\"",
      "Beyond concern about spending cuts, other Senate Republicans have voiced concern for Medicaid restrictions, including Hawley. The Missouri Republican told reporters Monday that the president told him when they spoke that there should be \"no Medicaid benefit cuts,\" adding that he told Mr. Trump that they are \"singing from the same hymnbook.\" But Hawley remains concerned about changes to provider taxes and copay requirements in the legislation.",
      "The president also weighed in on Truth Social on Monday, urging Senate Republicans to work quickly on the bill.",
      "\"With the Senate coming back to Washington today, I call on all of my Republican friends in the Senate and House to work as fast as they can to get this Bill to MY DESK before the Fourth of JULY,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Further complicating matters, the Senate also has to contend with strict limits on the reconciliation process, which governs the legislation. Though the process allows the Senate to bypass a 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation, it also comes with its own hurdles. Under what's known as the Byrd rule, all provisions in the legislation must have direct budgetary consequences. And senators may challenge any portion of the bill that they say doesn't deal with taxes, spending or the debt limit and ask the Senate parliamentarian to resolve the dispute.",
      "Thune said \"Byrd conversations\" have been going on for the last week and would continue this week and next. And when asked whether Senate Republicans would rule out overruling the parliamentarian, he told reporters \"we're not going there.\"",

    "summary": "The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season begins during a tumultuous period at the National Weather Service, following significant cuts at the country's forecasting agency.",
    "story": [
      "At the start of this year's\u00a0Atlantic hurricane season, a pared-down National Weather Service is scrambling to deal with the realities of severe staffing gaps at the agency in charge of forecasting and preparing the public for weather-related disasters in every part of the country.",
      "Concerned meteorologists warn that the forecasts communities have come to depend on as their front line of defense against hurricanes could suffer this year, as the National Weather Service remains chiefly responsible for predicting storms despite recently losing at least 10% of its workforce.",
      "The cuts stemmed from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending when he retook office, in part by slashing federal jobs.",
      "Through a combination of mass firings and buyouts since January, about 1,000 workers have left the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Weather Service's parent agency and the nucleus of weather and climate information in the United States, multiple current and former employees told CBS News. Roughly 550 of those departures came out of the Weather Service, including its National Hurricane Center, which is the division focused on tropical storms, and numerous local forecast offices that monitor weather for their regions.",
      "Now CBS News has learned that NOAA plans to fill 126 \"critical vacancies\" within the National Weather Service as hurricane season gets underway. Ken Graham, the NWS director, told staff in an email that the agency was granted an exemption from the Trump administration's hiring freeze in order to do that. Open positions for meteorologists, hydrologists, physical scientists and electronics technicians at certain locations will be listed on USA Jobs, Graham said. He did not specify the locations.",
      "Atlantic hurricane seasons run annually from June 1 to Nov. 30, and this next one is slated to be more active than an average year, according to NOAA forecasters. Their latest hurricane outlook predicted an \"above-normal\" hurricane season in 2025, likely producing between 13 and 19 named storms. Six to 10 of them are expected to become hurricanes, and three to five could be major, as in Category 3 or above.",
      "\"Uncharted territory\"",
      "Groups of lawmakers, forecasters and retired agency leaders have all spoken out about potentially catastrophic consequences ahead if the agency enters its busiest period without enough employees to reasonably handle the load. In an open letter released earlier this month, four former Weather Service directors pleaded with the Trump administration to replenish resources at the agency or risk \"needless loss of life.\"",
      "Bill Read, a retired Weather Service meteorologist and the director of the National Hurricane Center from 2008 until 2012, told CBS News he believes the agency is committed to its mission to safeguard life and property and \"will do whatever it takes to get the job done,\" even if that means employees take on additional work to make up for vacancies this summer and fall. But Read also said he never witnessed staff shortages during his tenure that could compare to those affecting the agency now.",
      "\"It's uncharted territory,\" Read said. \"They have a very difficult task, the folks that are still working there, trying to maintain the level of service that they've gotten used to giving, and that the public has gotten used to getting.\"",
      "Multiple people interviewed for this story said that understaffed local forecast offices are the greatest cause for alarm. Mike Brennan, the Hurricane Center's current director, told \"CBS Mornings\" that federal cuts had not meaningfully affected its national headquarters, where he said staff is \"fully operational, ready for the hurricane season.\"",
      "In a statement emailed to CBS News, a Weather Service spokesperson said the agency \"has updated the service level standards for its weather service forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources\" and \"continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.\"",
      "\"The National Weather Service continues to meet its core mission of providing life-saving forecasts, warnings, and decision support services to the public, our partners and stakeholders,\" the spokesperson said. \"These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce.\"",
      "Limited hours",
      "The Weather Service already faced declining employment in the years leading up to the Trump administration's firing spree. In its aftermath, regional forecast offices in at least six different cities are critically understaffed, according to multiple people interviewed for this story.",
      "Tom Fahy, the legislative director of the union representing Weather Service employees, told CBS News those offices are located in Jackson, Kentucky, where a devastating tornado two weeks ago killed at least 19 people and left hundreds homeless in that state alone; Goodland, Kansas; Cheyenne, Wyoming; Hanford, California; Sacramento, California; and, starting June 1, Fairbanks, Alaska.",
      "While they are not the primary targets of tropical storms, eastern Kentucky was hit hard by the powerful remnants of Hurricane Helene last September and each region on that list is vulnerable to other kinds of disastrous weather that tend to spike around this time of year.",
      "Aiming to address their resource deficits as the Trump administration blocks most federal hiring, a process is underway at the National Weather Service to transfer staff from less depleted offices into critically understaffed ones, which strains the entire system, said Brian LaMarre, a former Weather Service meteorologist who accepted an early retirement offer this year after three decades with the agency. Those transfers will continue along with the agency's new hiring exemption, Graham said in his email to staff.",
      "Staffing levels are considered critical at a forecast office when it employs seven or fewer \"operational\" meteorologists, meaning those who handle daily forecasting duties, LaMarre said. When fully staffed, a forecast office typically assigns rotating shifts to 12 or 15 operational workers in order to cover a complete 24-hour schedule. But at locations now facing critical shortages, staffing overnight shifts on a routine basis is no longer possible.",
      "Curtailing a local office's hours could prevent urgent messages about an incoming storm from the Weather Service's national headquarters to regional forecasters whose jurisdictions are directly affected. That could be especially dangerous if a storm develops unexpectedly, said a Weather Service meteorologist who is still employed by the agency and asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to avoid possible retaliation.",
      "\"The Hurricane Center sends out the large-scale forecast, the big picture, and then it's up to the weather forecast offices to tailor to their local areas,\" the meteorologist said. \"How in the world will we know who to talk to when these offices are closed in the middle of the night? If there's enough warning, I suspect someone will be there, but sometimes hurricanes are a surprise, especially the weaker tropical storms.\"",
      "Widespread vacancies",
      "At least 36 of the nation's 122 forecast offices are missing specialists in key roles, even if their capacities have not technically met the criteria to be labeled critically low, according to internal job postings sent out to Weather Service staff in May and reviewed by CBS News.",
      "Several of them are in hurricane-prone areas along the Gulf Coast, including Lake Charles, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Miami. They are bracing for the tropical storm season with just eight operational positions currently staffed, said Fahy. He told CBS News that Houston and Key West are doing the same with nine.",
      "Forecast offices in Houston and Lake Charles are among many without a meteorologist-in-charge, according to current and former Weather Service meteorologists and the job postings. That role is the most senior of three supervising meteorologists normally assigned to a given forecast office, who also functions as the director of that location. Another is the Tampa Bay office, which is also on the Gulf and frequently contends with hurricanes.",
      "LaMarre was the meteorologist-in-charge in Tampa Bay before retiring and said he feels confident the two meteorologists who worked under him will be able to fill his now-vacant previous role in an acting capacity.",
      "But, at the Houston/Galveston office, which was a notably crucial source of information during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the top three meteorologist positions are vacant along with a fourth chief analyst who maintains the office's electrical systems, according to its staff roster as of May 30. In addition to its meteorologist-in-charge, the office is also lacking a warning coordination meteorologist, who works with emergency managers to share severe weather warnings with the community, and its science and information officer, who verifies the scientific and technological integrity of an office's forecasts.",
      "\"We can't possibly talk to every emergency manager across the U.S. That's where the relationships between warning coordination meteorologists and emergency managers come in,\" said the meteorologist who asked not to be named. \"Those relationships are degraded or non-existent with the loss of staffers.\"",
      "Less weather data",
      "The Weather Service announced in the wake of the spring's federal firings that it would suspend or restrict weather balloon launches at 11 forecast offices across the country due to lack of adequate staffing \u2014 a move that effectively scaled back one of the most reliable methods used to track weather patterns in real-time.",
      "Weather balloons traditionally have been launched twice daily, at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. EST, from 100 forecast offices around the country. They carry electronic measuring devices into the atmosphere that collect data and transmit it directly into a computer modeling system that the Weather Service uses to predict storms, often laying the foundation for local forecasts. During an evolving weather emergency, like a hurricane, the balloons help meteorologists anticipate the path of the storm.",
      "Meteorologists are also concerned about additional funding cuts down the line. A White House budget proposal for 2026 suggests reducing NOAA's allocation by about $1.5 billion, which would shrink the agency by 30%. The plan targets programming around weather research, oceanic observations and satellites, areas the proposal's critics say are essential for accurate storm forecasts.",
      "\"That research is what helps the Weather Service save lives in the future,\" said LaMarre. \"If we sever research and operations, it's hard to improve with new technology and new techniques.\"",
      "An extended hiring freeze",
      "Outside of its exemption to fill \"critical vacancies,\" the Trump administration's federal hiring freeze prevents the Weather Service from recruiting new candidates to fill open positions until at least mid-July. So, for weeks, the agency has been trying to reshuffle its workforce and move employees from larger offices to critically understaffed locations in hopes of balancing the scales.",
      "The internal job postings distributed earlier this month sought immediate applications for 155 operational roles, including 76 meteorologist positions, at shorthanded locations. The openings appeared in a document titled \"Notice for Non-Competitive Reassignment,\" which asked eligible candidates to apply by May 27.",
      "Redistributing labor likely would not be a sustainable solution on its own, especially if small offices contended with repeated tropical storms in the coming months, said Alan Sealls, a retired broadcast meteorologist recognized for his work around hurricanes and the rising president of the American Meteorological Society.",
      "\"I know a lot of weather service employees, and they are dedicated to doing what they need to do. However, I know that when you have cuts and layoffs, it means everyone who's left is working harder with fewer people resources, and that opens you up to fatigue. It opens you up to the possibility of small errors and oversights,\" Sealls said. \"If we have a season where it's nonstop storm activity, everybody's going to be stretched to the limit.

    "story": [
      "U.S. economic growth is likely to hit the brakes this year, with GDP dramatically slowing due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and uncertainty around its economic policies, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, said Tuesday.",
      "GDP growth is forecast to slide to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year, a sharp reduction from the 2.8% growth recorded last year, according to the OECD, an international organization of 38 member countries that focuses on promoting economic growth.",
      "While the OECD's U.S. forecast didn't mention President Trump by name, the report cited new tariffs as one of the primary causes of the economic slowdown. The Trump administration's policies, which have introduced new import duties on almost every foreign nation, have hiked the effective tariff rate to 15.4% from 2% last year, marking the highest rate since 1938, the group said.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart, those costs are largely passed onto consumers in the form of higher costs \u2014 prompting the OECD to forecast that inflation in the U.S. will \"spike in mid-2025\" and reach 3.9% by the end of 2025.",
      "The Consumer Price Index rose by\u00a02.3% in April, as the tariffs largely hadn't yet impacted prices at that point.",
      "Without mentioning Mr. Trump, OECD chief economist \u00c1lvaro Pereira wrote in a commentary that accompanied the forecast that \"we have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment.''",
      "The report added that the U.S. is facing risks \"skewed to the downside, including a more substantial slowing of economic activity in the face of policy uncertainty, greater-than-expected upward pressure on prices from tariff increases, and large financial market corrections.\"",
      "World economic growth is also forecast to slow to 2.9% this year and stay there in 2026, according to the OECD's forecast. That would mark a substantial deceleration from growth of 3.3% global growth last year and 3.4% in 2023.",

      "Moore, who was captain of a shark-diving charter boat, and Mansell, a crew member, spotted the longline about 3 miles off the Jupiter Inlet in August 2020, according to court records. Believing it was an illegal fishing line, the men freed the sharks and grouper, reported it to state wildlife officials and brought the line back to shore.",
      "Federal prosecutors later charged the men with theft. Officials said the line actually belonged to a fisherman licensed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to catch sharks for research.",
      "Mansell and Moore were convicted by a jury, and their appeals were later denied. The full and unconditional pardons signed by Mr. Trump erase those convictions.",
      "\"This case never should have been filed,\" Mansell's attorney, Ian Goldstein, said in a statement. \"These gentlemen made an honest mistake and were trying to save sharks from what they believed to be an illegal longline fishing setup.

      "Speaking with CBS News from her home in Idaho, Hemphill said, \"The pardons just contribute to their narrative, which is all lies, propaganda. We were guilty, period.\"",
      "\"We all know that they're gaslighting us. They are using January 6 to just continue Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized,\" she said. \"They were not. When the FBI came to my home, oh my God, they were very professional. They treated me very good.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted a federal trade court's decision blocking most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, for now reinstating the levies imposed by the president under an emergency powers law.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief order that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now.",
      "A three-judge panel on the trade court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect.",
      "\"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the Federal Circuit to review the trade court's decision and also requested it halt that ruling while it considers the appeal. The administration warned in a filing Thursday that absent interim relief, it would turn to the Supreme Court \"to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, White House spokesperson Kush Desai called Thursday's ruling \"a positive development for America's industries and workers.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" Desai said. \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",
      "Later, in a June 3 order, the judge agreed to pause his decision while the Trump administration pursues an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Citing the stay issued by the Federal Circuit in the other cases, Contreras wrote that similar action in the legal battle before him is \"therefore appropriate to protect the President's ability to identify and respond to threats to the U.S. economy and national security.\"",

    "story": [
      "Smoke from wildfires in Canada has drifted into the U.S., prompting air quality alerts for Americans as it continues to spread.",
      "But when officials and forecasters classify a city's air as \"unhealthy\" or \"hazardous,\" what does that really mean? The classifications are based on a federal measurement system called the Air Quality Index.",
      "What is the Air Quality Index?",
      "The Air Quality Index is used nationwide to measure the severity of air pollution and categorize the health risks that are involved with various levels of pollution. The index uses six color-coded categories: good (green), moderate (yellow), unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange), unhealthy (red), very unhealthy (purple) and hazardous (maroon).",
      "The health impacts included in the index are those that people are likely to experience within \"a few hours or days\" after being exposed to the air, the National Weather Service Says.",
      "How is air quality measured?",
      "The National Weather Service says that the Environmental Protection Agency calculates the Air Quality Index \u2014 a value between 0 and 500 \u2014 based on five \"major pollutants.\"",
      "Those pollutants \u2014 ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide \u2014 are all regulated by the Clean Air Act. Of those, ground-level ozone and airborne particles are considered \"the greatest threat to human health.\"",
      "What do the numbers mean?",
      "Each Air Quality Index category, also known as the level of concern, is attached to a certain range of values:",
      "Good (green): 0 to 50Moderate (yellow): 51 to 100Unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange): 101 to 150Unhealthy (red): 151 to 200\u00a0Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300\u00a0Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",

      "Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300",
      "Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",
      "Essentially, the lower the number, the cleaner the air. The only category where air quality is considered \"satisfactory\" is the one where the index value is no more than 50, although values between 51 and 100 are still considered \"acceptable.\" After that, the air could pose a risk to at least some people, and that risk only becomes greater as the index value rises.",
      "Once the air is deemed \"very unhealthy,\" the general public is at risk of experiencing health impacts, which range from a headache and fatigue to much more serious issues such as heart attack or stroke. At \"hazardous\" levels, the region is experiencing an air quality emergency. Those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions are more at risk of developing serious health issues as pollution worsens.",
      "What is the air quality near me?",
      "Air Quality Index values change constantly throughout the day as weather conditions and weather patterns move through the area. The map below automatically updates to show air quality conditions nationwide.",
      "The EPA's\u00a0AirNow.gov site uses the index to provide the latest status for your area. To use the site, enter your ZIP code and a meter will pop up showing you what the value and color category is for your city, as well as the last time that measurement was updated.",
      "It also tells you what pollutant is causing issues, who is most at risk for health complications and what activities may be safe to do.",
      "In Minneapolis, for example, the reading on Tuesday morning, June 3, said the AQI for PM2.5, a kind of particulate matter, is 203, meaning \"very unhealthy,\" and that people who have heart or lung disease, those who are elderly, and children and teens should avoid outdoor physical activity.

      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",
      "During its 25,000-year orbit, the object is only close enough to Earth to be observed around 0.5 percent of the time, which is roughly a century.",

      "A U.S. senator's spouse was placed on a government watchlist in 2023 after a surveillance program flagged his travel profile, but he was removed after the senator back-channeled with administration officials, sources familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "Shortly after New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen spoke with the Transportation Security Administration about her husband, William Shaheen, TSA officials removed him from a list of people subjected to additional scrutiny under TSA's \"Quiet Skies\" domestic surveillance program.",
      "William Shaheen, an Lebanese-American attorney active in the Arab-American community, was then placed on a different list, which excluded him from any future advanced screening, including random checks at airport TSA checkpoints, two of the sources said.",
      "The episode took place in a heightened security environment in October 2023, days after Hamas attacked Israel and killed more than 1,200 people.",
      "TSA's surveillance efforts have long attracted criticism for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes. The circumstances that land an individual on a list \u2014 or what gets them removed \u2014 have been mostly concealed from the public.",
      "Quiet Skies, which began in 2010, employs analysts and undercover air marshals to monitor people in airports and during flights, using outstanding warrants, facial recognition software, identification of suspicious travel patterns and behaviors and other data to try to prevent terrorist attacks.",
      "Some Americans undertake exhaustive efforts to get themselves removed from the Quiet Skies enhanced screening list \u2014 with some even engaging in protracted legal fights.",
      "Republican Tulsi Gabbard spoke out in 2024 after she was placed on the Quiet Skies list and subjected to searches and monitoring by federal air marshals. Gabbard, a former presidential candidate and Democratic member of Congress, has since been confirmed as the director of national intelligence.",
      "Shaheen's husband, according to sources, was removed from Quiet Skies two days after she contacted David Pekoske, then the TSA administrator. Pekoske served in the post under both Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "The decision to then shield the senator's husband by putting him on what TSA calls the \"secure flight exclusion list\" marked an unusual step in a system meant to operate outside of political interference.",
      "A spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen told CBS News on Tuesday that she contacted TSA after her husband was subjected to several extensive, invasive and degrading searches at airport checkpoints \u2013 and was seeking to understand the nature and cause.",
      "Sources told CBS News that in July 2023, William Shaheen was pulled aside for extra screening at the Boston airport ahead of two flights. Officials said at the time that the security agency randomly selected travelers for additional screening, and William Shaheen had been randomly chosen.",
      "Three months later, William Shaheen was flagged by the transportation security agency because his travel companion on two flight reservations was a person listed by the FBI as a \"known or suspected terrorist,\" or KST, a broad designation that covers a wide-ranging risk profile. A federal air marshal was sent to covertly travel near them on a flight on Oct. 18, 2023, one source said.",
      "Sen. Shaheen spoke with Pekoske to ask about the situation regarding her husband. On Oct. 20, 2023, her husband was added to the \"secure flight exclusion list,\" a VIP list that exempts a traveler from the security agency's vetting and surveillance programs, including random screenings.",
      "An order from TSA headquarters was sent to ensure the safeguarded status for William Shaheen was signaled when his future boarding passes were presented at airports.",
      "The spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen said she wasn't aware that her husband had been monitored under the Quiet Skies program, or that he had later been given preferential treatment by being specifically excluded from enhanced screening.",
      "The person William Shaheen traveled with, whose identity could not be confirmed by CBS News, was removed from the FBI terrorism watchlist later in 2023, sources familiar with the matter said. It was not clear why the person was placed on the list, though a host of factors including visits to hostile countries, certain suspicious travel patterns, or contacts with designated terror suspects can all contribute to the listing.",
      "The spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen declined to identify her husband's travel companion other than to say the person was an Arab-American attorney. The senator was not given any indication the person was designated as a known or suspected terrorist, the spokesperson said.",
      "William Shaheen was recently removed from the list of people excluded from any enhanced surveillance, a Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized what he refers to as the weaponization of state power and the use of government levers to go after political opponents, but since his reelection, has sought to settle scores with those he perceives to have wronged him.",
      "Sen. Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump and his policies, has announced she will not seek reelection in 2026. Her eldest daughter, Democrat Stefany Shaheen, is running for a seat in the U.S. House.",

    "summary": "The \"ice battery\" system freezes water at night when the cost of electricity is low. Then, during the day, when the price is high, the building is cooled with the previous night's ice instead of using expensive electricity.",
    "story": [
      "New York\u00a0\u2014 In the heart of Manhattan, four stories below ground, the iconic Eleven Madison skyscraper is being air-conditioned using ice.",
      "\"There's about 500,000 pounds of ice created every night,\" said Holly Paeper, president of Trane Technologies, the company responsible for installing the system it calls an ice battery. \"And to put that into context, think about three city buses full of ice cubes.\"",
      "The ice battery system freezes water at night when the cost of electricity is low. Then, during the day, when the price is high, the building is cooled with the previous night's ice instead of using expensive electricity. Trane says that this system can lower cooling costs by up to 40%.",
      "\"So, when everyone else is using their electricity in the middle of July to cool their building or to cool their homes, it's a big draw on the grid,\" Paeper said. \"This building won't draw from that because it made its ice last night.\"",
      "Air conditioning makes up about 20% of energy use in homes and businesses worldwide, according to a 2018 report from the International Energy Agency. But on the hottest days, it can account for more than 70% of electricity use during peak hours, per a 2023 IEA report.",
      "\"We've done installations at about 4,000 sites globally,\" Paeper said. \"There are six million commercial buildings in the U.S. alone, and a very small fraction of them have installations like this.\"",
      "The problem that scientists like Dr. Patrick Shamberger are trying to solve isn't an overall lack of energy \u2014 it's when too many energy consumers are trying to use electricity at the same time, which puts stress on the grid.",
      "\"We don't want to build a whole bunch of excess power plants to just sit around, never turned on until that hot, hot day in August,\" said Shamberger, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at Texas A&M. \"It's a lot of capital investment that doesn't get used.\"",
      "So, instead of building more power plants, the focus is on storing energy with a system such as ice batteries. But because the process of freezing water uses a lot of energy itself, Shamberger and others are testing new materials that don't need to get as cold as ice, but can still keep buildings cool.",
      "\"We take water, we add some other elements and molecules to it,\" Shamberger explained. \"And based on the composition, we can control that temperature basically anywhere we want it, in the zero to 20 C range. And that's important, because what might work great here in Texas, maybe it's not the right temperature to store your heat at if you're in Nevada, or in Wisconsin, say.\"",
      "According to an analysis released last month by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a Washington, D.C.-based energy advocacy group, home electricity bills in the U.S. this summer are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, from June through September, up 6.2% from last year's projected average of $737.",
      "It marks the highest such average in the 12 years that NEADA has been tracking summer residential cooling.",
      "Shamberger said he sees a world where this system can be used to cool homes.",

      "\"Even with the safety net cuts, the House bill leads to public debt rising by over $3 trillion in coming years (and over $5 trillion over the next decade if provisions are made permanent rather than phasing out),\" the economists state. \"The higher debt and deficits will put noticeable upward pressure on both inflation and interest rates in coming years.\"",

Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0 Paul is among a small group of Senate Republicans who have expressed opposition to the bill.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from getting work permits.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from getting work permits, potentially upending longstanding U.S. immigration policy, two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News.",
      "A proposal by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would amount to an indefinite pause on the U.S. government's decades-old policy of allowing migrants with pending asylum claims to work in the country lawfully while their cases are decided, the DHS officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
      "The proposed changes \u2014 which have not been previously reported \u2014 would add yet another layer to President Trump's government-wide immigration crackdown, targeting a massively backlogged asylum system that his top aides have argued is being systematically exploited by economic migrants.",
      "But a halt to work permits for asylum-seekers would also trigger concerns among advocates that it could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, and drive them to work illegally in the underground economy.",
      "Since the 1990s, U.S. law has allowed immigration officials to grant work permits to asylum applicants if their cases have been pending for at least 180 days. Generally speaking, that has allowed asylum applicants to request a work permit 150 days after they make their claim. Those eligible can be granted the permit after another 30 days.",
      "But a regulation under internal consideration by the Trump administration would suspend the issuance of new work permits to asylum-seekers until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, the DHS officials said.",
      "That timeframe would be exceedingly difficult to meet in the near future, given massive case backlogs and operational constraints. Last year, for example, a federal government watchdog found that over 77% of the asylum applications before USCIS had been pending for beyond 180 days. Nearly 40% of applications remained unresolved after two years.",
      "Even if the 180-day processing average is reached, the proposal would require asylum-seekers to wait one year until after they file their application \u2014 instead of six months \u2014 to be eligible for a work permit, the DHS officials said.",
      "It's unclear when the regulation may be publicly announced, or if it will be altered before being finalized.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said it does not comment on the \"deliberative process or possible decision making.\"",
      "\"Over the previous four years, the Biden administration eviscerated the integrity of America's asylum system. The Department is exploring all possible options to protect our national security and increase program integrity,\" DHS said in its statement. \"DHS is working to mitigate all forms of fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The changes under consideration by the Trump administration would apply to asylum seekers with pending applications sent to USCIS and those in deportation proceedings before the immigration courts, which are overseen by the Justice Department.",
      "Asylum can be granted to foreigners on U.S. soil who prove they are fleeing persecution due to their nationality, race, religion, political views or membership in a social group. While factors like nationality and legal representation play a key role, many applicants do not ultimately meet the high legal threshold to win asylum, government figures show.",
      "Still, over the past decade, amid record arrivals of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, the number of asylum applications has ballooned. USCIS is overseeing roughly 1.5 million asylum applications, while the immigration courts are reviewing another 2 million, according to government data.",
      "The plan under consideration would seek to eliminate what Trump administration officials have described as a magnet for migrants using the asylum system simply to work in the U.S. It echoes a 2020 rule issued by the first Trump administration that sought to increase the waiting period for asylum applicants requesting work authorization from six months to a year and impose other restrictions on eligibility for work permits.",
      "The proposed rule would also be the latest step taken by the second Trump administration to make the U.S. inhospitable for asylum-seekers.",
      "Immediately after returning to the White House in January, President Trump all but closed the U.S. asylum system, giving border agents the power to summarily deport most migrants on the grounds the country is facing an \"invasion.\" That emergency order is being challenged by pro-immigrant advocates, who say it ignores American asylum law.",
      "Conchita Cruz, the co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a group that supports those with asylum claims, said efforts to curtail work permits for the migrants she serves would hurt U.S. communities and employers.",

      "U.S. Navy documents obtained by CBS News and used to brief the secretary of the Navy and his chief of staff show proposed timelines for rolling out the name change of the USNS Harvey Milk to the public. While the documents do not say what the ship's new name would be, the proposal comes during Pride Month, the monthlong observance of the LGBTQ+ community that also coincides with the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising of 1969. WorldPride celebrations are being held in Washington, D.C., this year.",
      "The documents obtained by CBS News also show other vessels named after prominent leaders are also on the Navy's renaming \"recommended list.\"",
      "Among them are the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, USNS Harriet Tubman, USNS Dolores Huerta, USNS Lucy Stone, USNS Cesar Chavez and USNS Medgar Evers.",
      "CBS News found that a December 2024 web article from Naval Sea Systems Command about the laying of the keel for the future USNS Thurgood Marshall has been deleted.",
      "\"The reported decision by the Trump Administration to change the names of the USNS Harvey Milk and other ships in the John Lewis-class is a shameful, vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American Dream,\" Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi told CBS News in a statement.",
      "She added, \"Our military is the most powerful in the world \u2013 but this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the 'warrior' ethos. Instead, it is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News the move was \"an utter abomination in terms of the extreme MAGA Republican effort to continue to erase American history, and we're not going to allow it to happen.\" And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on X that Hegseth \"should be ashamed of himself and reverse this immediately.\"",
      "Following his confirmation in January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a\u00a0directive instructing the Pentagon and U.S. military services to cease hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months, citing concerns that such programs could undermine unity within the ranks. The \"Identity Months Dead at DoD\" guidance banned official manpower and resources from being used on such events \u2014 among them, Pride Month, Black History Month and Women's History Month.",
      "The documents obtained by CBS News were not marked with the traditional classification markers typically seen on Defense Department memos. The documents were not marked as \"For Official Use Only\" or \"Controlled Unclassified Information,\" they were also not marked to indicate they were drafts. There was a \"CAUTION\" note, however, referring to the information as publicly sensitive.",
      "The memo said the renaming of naval ships was to realign the U.S. military with Trump administration priorities of \"reestablishing the warrior culture.\"",
      "The documents call for Navy Secretary John Phelan to select a new name for the USNS Harvey Milk on Tuesday, with the notice of the name change going out to other senior U.S. Navy officials later in the week after undergoing legal review.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Hegseth \"is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief's priorities, our nation's history, and the warrior ethos.\" Parnell added that any potential renaming decisions would be announced once the internal reviews are complete. Military.com first reported the name change for the USNS Harvey Milk on Tuesday, but the news of other naval vessels being considered for a name change has not yet been reported.",
      "The USNS Harvey Milk is a John Lewis-class replenishment oiler, designed to support carrier strike groups at sea. The class of ships is named after civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis, who died in 2020.",
      "Harvey Milk, the political trailblazer, emerged in the 1970s as one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. After years of activism, he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, where he quickly became a national symbol of LGBTQ+ political empowerment. His life was cut short in 1978 when he was assassinated in City Hall, alongside Mayor George Moscone.",
      "The USNS Harvey Milk was christened in 2021 and represented a significant step toward inclusivity within the armed forces.",
      "Before he emerged as one of the most visible advocates for gay rights in American history, Milk served in the U.S. Navy. From 1952 to 1954, he held posts as an operations and dive officer aboard two submarine rescue ships \u2014 the USS Chanticleer and the USS Kittiwake \u2014 both active during the Korean War, according to the U.S. National Archives.",
      "But his sexual orientation carried profound consequences as Milk came under scrutiny. In December 1954, Milk, who was then a lieutenant junior grade, was facing a court martial for participating in a \"homosexual act\" a year earlier.",
      "Instead of facing trial, Milk was drummed out of the U.S. military, like so many other gay service members of his era. In January 1954, he resigned his commission and accepted an \"Other Than Honorable\" discharge. In 2021, the Navy approached Milk's nephew, Stuart Milk, to see if he wanted his uncle's discharge upgraded, according to NPR. Stuart decided against it as a reminder that not everyone was treated with honor.",
      "The name change would follow two base renamings Hegseth directed earlier this year to reverse the work a congressionally mandated naming commission did to remove names honoring the Confederacy. In February, he directed Fort Liberty in North Carolina return to Fort Bragg, saying it would now be named after a non-Confederate Bragg, and then directed Fort Moore change to Fort Benning, after another Benning.",
      "The naming commission also suggested the Navy rename the guided missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville, which honors a Confederate battle victory, to the USS Robert Smalls, to recognize a slave who stole a Confederate ship and surrendered it to the Union. The Navy also renamed the USNS Maury to the USNS Marie Tharp, removing the name of a Confederate sailor and replacing it with the name of a pioneering female oceanographer.",

    "story": [
      "McDonald's Snack Wrap, a gone-but-not-forgotten customer favorite, is returning to the fast-food chain's restaurants in the U.S. after a nine-year hiatus.",
      "The popular sandwich will reappear on menus starting July 10, 2025, according to an announcement by the company on Tuesday in which Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA,\u00a0stated\u00a0simply, \"It's back.\"",
      "Consisting of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, the Snack Wrap was introduced nearly two decades ago. However, the item was removed from McDonald's menus in 2016 because it was too complicated for its kitchens to prepare. Customers have been calling for the Snack Wrap's return ever since.",
      "In announcing the Snack Wrap's return, the company included a link to a webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, which it describes as a \"content hub for the most anticipated menu item of the decade.\" Featuring Snack Wrap wallpaper as its background, the promotional webpage includes various large folders users can click into. A folder entitled \"Fandom,\" for example, houses screenshots of social media posts from Snack Wrap fans expressing their love for the food and asking when it would be returned to McDonald's menus.",
      "In one email, entitled \"Snack Wraps for this Pregnant Lady,\" a McDonald's customer named Carli writes \"my biggest craving is something I can't have. I am due July 14th, 2025. Will snack wraps be back before then? Please just give me a hint.\"",
      "\"I've waited years and I'm getting mildly impatient\" wrote another fan called \"loyal snack wrap lover.\"",
      "Another, more proactive display of loyalty included a Change.org petition to bring back the Snack Wrap. The petition garnered nearly 19,000 signatures. Bringing back the wrap was a \"years-long process,\" Erlinger told The Associated Press.",
      "In its revived form, the Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in two flavors: Ranch and Spicy. This is a departure from the original version, which included a choice of grilled or fried chicken and sauce options like honey mustard and sweet chili. The simplified recipe is to ensure faster service, according to the company. The company has not revealed how much the Snack Wrap will cost, only that prices will vary depending on location.",
      "McDonald's also posted on the Snack Wrap's on its X account, thanking ardent fans for resurrecting the long-lost menu item. Breaking the fourth wall, the social media manager behind the McDonald's account\u00a0addressed\u00a0followers directly, reminding them that \"social media managers don't control the menu,\" but rather its the fans who are to thank for the Snack Wrap's revival. Stated the post, \"you created a movement. a movement so powerful that you finally won.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Elon Musk ramped up his criticism of President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" on Tuesday, calling it \"a disgusting abomination\" as Congress rushes to send the legislation to the president by July 4.",
      "\"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,\" Musk wrote in a post on X, adding that the sweeping policy bill aimed at advancing Mr. Trump's domestic priorities is \"outrageous\" and \"pork-filled.\"",
      "\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,\" he said. Hours later, he warned, \"In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the criticism during the daily press briefing, telling reporters that Mr. Trump \"already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn't change the president's opinion.\"",
      "Musk told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in a recent interview that he was \"disappointed\" by the price tag of the measure, which passed the House before Memorial Day after Mr. Trump stepped up pressure on the Republican holdouts to fall in line. Musk said the package increases the deficit and undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk told CBS News, \"but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.\"",
      "Some Republican senators were quick to chime in Tuesday and back Musk's sentiment. The package is now in the hands of the Senate and is expected to undergo changes before heading back to the House.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who opposes the House-passed legislation over the debt ceiling increase, urged the president to \"take some advice from Elon.\" Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who also wants a number of changes to the bill, told reporters he shared Musk's concerns.",

      "\"I just deeply regret that he's made this mistake,\" Johnson said, suggesting that Musk's criticism is related to cuts to tax credits aimed at incentivizing electric vehicle purchases. \"I know that the EV mandate is very important to him. That is going away because the government should not be subsidizing these things ... and I know that has an effect on his business.\"",
      "\"For him to come out and pan the whole bill is, to me, just very disappointing, very surprising, in light of the conversation I had with him yesterday,\" Johnson said.",
      "Last Wednesday, Musk announced his departure as a \"special government employee,\" a designation that allowed him to work for the administration under different ethics rules than federal employees and limited his work to 130 days.",
      "Musk vowed to slash $1 trillion from the federal budget but left the Trump administration falling far short of that goal. Nonetheless, DOGE's cuts to the government workforce, dismantling of agencies and cancelation in billions of grants and contracts sent shock waves through Washington that reverberated across the country and abroad.",

    "summary": "The norovirus strain GII.17 may have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "After years of largely predictable norovirus waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain called GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks.",
      "\"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years,\" wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in an article published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.",
      "Outbreaks have since slowed to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.",
      "\"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined,\" the CDC researchers wrote.",
      "Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance.",
      "In England, norovirus reports reached levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus through April, far above GII.4.",
      "In Japan, where GII.17 previously drove a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo reported a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis \u2014 most from norovirus \u2014 that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.",
      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",

    "summary": "Experts share tips on how to reduce your electricity bill.",
    "story": [
      "With weather\u00a0forecasts\u00a0showing above-normal temperatures throughout the country this summer, heat-weary Americans will soon likely be turning up their air conditioners for relief. But that comfort will come at a cost.",
      "Home electricity bills\u00a0are expected to reach their highest average rate in 12 years, at $784 for the summer period, according to a recent analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The elevated cost comes as a one-two punch for families already financially strapped after this winter season's higher-than-average heating costs.",
      "Those most impacted by higher summer utility bills will be lower-income households, which often lack the resources to cover monthly payments. About one in four households say they can't pay their energy bills, according to the most recent Census Household Pulse Survey.",
      "The stakes for keeping cool are high. \"Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, resulting in hundreds of fatalities each year,\"\u00a0according to the National Weather Service. Higher temperatures can lead to heat stroke and heat exhaustion.",
      "Heat waves are\u00a0already hitting\u00a0parts of the U.S. like\u00a0Texas. As Mayo Clinic points out, unexpected fluctuations in the temperature often catch people off guard.",
      "For those looking for relief from high temperatures and high bills, experts offer helpful suggestions. \"There are simple things to do,\" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA. \"You can do them now, and they pay off.\"",
      "Here are tips to reduce your energy costs as summer heats up.",
      "Low-hanging fruit",
      "As a starting point, Americans can tackle low-hanging fruit options, like using a fan in place of, or in addition to an AC. Fans use far less electricity than air conditioners and are priced more reasonably, whether you're looking for a box fan, a pedestal fan or another model.",
      "For those with ceiling fans there's a hack for staying extra cool. Experts recommend setting ceiling fans to rotate counterclockwise during summer months, as doing so pushes warm air down and keeps a cool breeze going. In the fall and winter, rotation should be switched back to clockwise so that as warm air rises, it's circulated throughout the room, said Laurie Wheelock, executive director and counsel at New York's Utility Project (PULP).",
      "If you use an AC, make sure to change the air filter regularly. Wolfe recommends replacing AC filters monthly during the summer, to help units run more efficiently. For those who plan to keep their unit running during the day, you can set it to a few degrees higher before you leave your home to conserve energy.",
      "Wolfe advises setting your AC temperature between 70\u00b0F and 78\u00b0F when you are at home, and 78\u00b0F when the house is empty.",
      "Other small adjustments to keep your space cool include using indoor plants to create shade, keeping your curtains closed to block out the sunlight during the day, investing in reflective blinds or UV-reflective film for windows. Also, limit your oven use and make sure to turn it off right after using it, as it can warm up your space significantly, said Wolfe.",
      "For general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. Wolfe also recommends running your refrigerator and freezer at the regular temperature as directed by the manufacturer.",
      "\"Running them at cooler temperatures might seem like a good idea in the summer, but that can drive up electricity costs and potentially wear out the electrical appliance,\" he said.",
      "Also, make sure nothing is blocking the airflow of your heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Plant life or other obstacles in front of vents can make units less efficient, Wolfe noted.",
      "Look to your state or utility company for help",
      "While it may seem counter-intuitive, your utility company may be able to help you bear the cost burden of higher bills.",
      "\"Some utilities run programs to help make your home more energy efficient in the summer,\" said Wolfe. \"They'll offer rebates if you buy more efficient air conditioners, no-cost audits of your home, and they'll subsidize the cost of installing more insulation.\"",
      "In New York, for example, energy giants ConEd and National Grid have monthly discount programs that provide bill credits to low-income households. Wheelock said PULP has seen ConEd customers save $30 to $45 per month on gas an electricity as part of New York's Energy Affordability program, which is administered by the state's major electric and natural gas utilities.",
      "State governments can also be a useful resource. Depending on where you live, your local government may offer free home energy assessments, weatherization assistance or an energy efficiency program designs to help residents lower their electricity bill.",
      "For those struggling to make ends meet, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a federally funded initiative with a\u00a0network\u00a0of state-run programs, provides financial assistance to low-income households.",
      "HEAP provides eligible households, including apartments, with air conditioning units or fans, up to a value of $800, according to WE ACT for Environment Justice, a New York-based environmental justice organization.",
      "\"Anyone at risk of service termination who is low-income should contact their local Department of Social Services to discuss financial assistance programs including Emergency Energy Assistance,\" said Wheelock.",

      "With hotter temperatures here to stay, Wolfe said it may be worth investing in more permanent measures like improving your home's insulation or updating your ductwork. This will improve ventilation, keep cold air locked in and make your home more energy efficient overall.",
      "Another option is installing a smart thermostat, which allows you to remotely control the temperature of your space. They can also automatically adjust heating and cooling based on when you're home. Models like Ecobee's Smart Thermostat Essential or Google's Nest Smart Learning Thermostat typically run anywhere from $100 to $200.",
      "These investments may cost more upfront but will save you money over time, says Wolfe. \"In making your home more energy efficient, the savings will pay for the improvements,\" he said.",
      "For those ready to make an even bigger leap, installing a heat pump, switching to central air or upgrading your HVAC or AC system to one with a high Energy Star rating\u00a0are other long-term investments.",
      "Something to keep in mind before you make any of these purchases is whether electricity in your state is high enough to warrant the investment.",
      "\"If you're in like the northeast using heating oil, heat pumps make a lot of sense,\" said Wolfe.",
      "Even before you buy a home, it's worth investigating what the energy bills will look like. You can do this by getting an energy audit from a utility company, said Wolfe.",

      "A suspect is in custody after what the FBI is calling a \"targeted act of violence\" during a peaceful march in support of Israeli hostages at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday.",
      "Witnesses said the suspect used a \"makeshift flamethrower\" and threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims, police and the FBI said. Boulder police initially said eight people were injured; they raised the total to 12 on Monday afternoon after officials said four more people with less serious injuries came forward.",
      "The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday evening. Soliman was allegedly heard yelling \"Free Palestine\" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said that it was \"clear this is a targeted act of violence\" and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism.",
      "Soliman has been charged with multiple felony counts, including attempted murder, and a federal hate crimes charge.",
      "Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, the Department of Homeland Security said. That original visa expired in February 2023, and he had applied for asylum. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs.",
      "The FBI said later Sunday night it was \"conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder\" in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located.",
      "Soliman has been charged with multiple felony counts and a federal hate crimes charge.",
      "The walk to remember the\u00a0Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza\u00a0was taking place in Boulder's downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also yelled \"End Zionist!\" during the attack.",
      "Among those injured were four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, police said. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be \"safe to say\" that person was in critical condition.",
      "Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a \"very loving person.\" Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.",
      "The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward.",
      "UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged.",
      "Following the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall.",
      "Omer Shachar, Run for Their Lives Denver co-leader, told CBS News the group reached out to Boulder police about security concerns surrounding the walk several times before Sunday's event. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said FBI agents were at the scene Sunday afternoon.",
      "U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi released a statement Monday after the federal charge was filed. \"The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Our prayers are with the victims and our Jewish community across the world,\" she said.",
      "Bondi added, \"This vile anti-Semitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC,\" referring to the fatal shooting of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky outside the Capital Jewish Museum on May 21. \"We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.\"",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media that the \"National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked \"simply because they were Jews\" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute \"the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law,\" according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a \"heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.\"",
      "\"As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,\" Polis said. \"Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Run for Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, \"This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release.\" The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video.",
      "Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they've been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages\u00a0each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday's walk.",
      "Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them.",
      "\"So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,\" said Victor.",
      "Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.",
      "\"I saw the aftermath,\" said street performer Peter Irish. \"It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.\"",
      "University of Colorado system President Todd Saliman said in a statement Sunday, \"My deepest sympathies go out tonight to those keeping weekly vigil who were viciously attacked in Boulder today. I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today's violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.\"",
      "A joint statement from Boulder's Jewish community said:",
      "We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza.",
      "We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed.",
      "Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.",
      "We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured.",
      "We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.",
      "Strength to you all.",
      "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser denounced the attack and offered to help the victims in a release Sunday afternoon:",
      "My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today's attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza.",
      "From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted. I have been in touch with Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and have offered support from the Attorney General's Office.",
      "People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts\u2014which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home\u2014must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.",

    "story": [
      "New research suggests that removing\u00a0fluoride\u00a0from public water would increase dental care costs and tooth decay for children across the United States.",
      "The study, published Friday in the JAMA Health Forum, used a nationally representative sample of 8,484 children aged 0 to 19 from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate projected outcomes of stopping water fluoridation in the U.S. \u2014 something some states, including\u00a0Utah and\u00a0Florida, have already begun doing.",
      "Researchers found removing fluoride was associated with an increase in tooth decay of 7.5 percentage points, or 25.4 million cases, and cost approximately $9.8 billion over 5 years.",
      "These effects would disproportionately affect publicly insured and uninsured children, who are already at the highest risk of unmet dental needs, the authors added.",
      "Fluoride is a mineral that helps strengthen teeth and reduce\u00a0cavities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It does this by repairing and preventing damage to teeth caused by bacteria in the mouth that produce acid, which in turn dissolves minerals in a tooth's surface and can even lead to tooth loss.",
      "Tooth decay by itself can be painful and costly to treat but left untreated can cause further problems, including infections and abscesses or even sepsis, according to the\u00a0World Health Organization. Some research has also linked poor\u00a0oral health\u00a0to other complications, such as\u00a0cardiovascular disease\u00a0due to inflammation and infection.",
      "The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century, but Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has brought it into question,\u00a0claiming\u00a0fluoride is linked to a slew of health problems. Dental experts have told CBS News they largely disagree.",
      "\"Seventy years of research, thousands of studies and the experience of more than 210 million Americans tell us that water fluoridation is effective in preventing cavities and is safe for children and adults,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0the American Dental Association.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, including most toothpaste brands, but\u00a0researchers say\u00a0drinking water is the main source for Americans. Plus, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced earlier this year that it is starting the process of removing ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for kids from the market.",

It was the third day of deadly violence reported near a humanitarian hub run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private organization accused by the United Nations of weaponizing aid.",
      "\"We were shocked by the numbers of injuries. A horrific number,\" one ambulance driver said as the wounded were rushed to the Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. \"All the injuries were directly to the head and chest. Many of them young people who went to get aid from the American foundation.\"",

      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung was elected president of South Korea in a snap election sparked by the impeachment of the country's former leader, Yoon Suk Yeol. As of early Wednesday, Lee had a lead over his conservative rival Kim Moon-soo that was mathematically impossible to surpass.",
      "Kim conceded the race, telling reporters he \"humbly accepts the people's choice\" and gave Lee his congratulations.",
      "Lee didn't formally claim victory when he appeared earlier before supporters in the nation's capital, repeating his goals to reinvigorate the economy and unite the country.",
      "\"Let us move forward with hope and make a fresh start from this moment on,\" he said. \"Though we may have clashed for some time, even those who did not support us are still our fellow citizens of the Republic of Korea.\"",
      "An impressive 77.8% of the country's eligible voters turned up at polling stations Tuesday to cast their ballots. It was the highest turnout ever seen in a Korean election, and the country's media had said exit polls made a victory by Lee all but certain after the voting ended.",
      "Kim had recently served as the employment and labor minister in the Cabinet of former President Yoon, who was\u00a0impeached\u00a0over his brief but shocking imposition of martial law late last year.",
      "Lee's Democratic Party has been the primary opposition party for several years, but with the win of the South Korean presidency, the Democrats find themselves back in control of both the executive branch and the parliament, where they already have a majority of seats, for the first time since 2022.",
      "There has not been an elected president in office since Yoon was impeached late last year, so there will be no formal transition period. The inauguration ceremony for the 21st president of South Korea is set to be held Wednesday, just hours after the final votes were cast.",
      "South Koreans filled the streets around central government buildings in Seoul in December after Yoon suddenly declared martial law. He said the draconian measure was necessary given the level of political division in South Korea, and claiming communist forces were threatening the public peace and safety.",
      "But Yoon's definition of an enemy within changed, as he first said the communists infiltrating South Korean politics were North Koreans, but then said it was Chinese influence that warranted his martial law declaration.",
      "Many younger South Koreans bristled, and they came out in force in front of the parliament, urging lawmakers to impeach Yoon, who did maintain significant support, particularly among older and right-wing voters.",
      "His huge political gamble with the martial law declaration, and his subsequent refusal to leave office following his impeachment, is widely seen as having shifted many voters to Lee and the Democratic Party.",

      "Who is Lee Jae-myung, South Korea's new leader?",

      "He will rely on that experience to help him navigate the power struggle between South Korea's longtime closest ally, the United States, and its neighbor China, as Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping engage in a trade war that has affected global markets.",
      "Lee vowed before the election that he would work to further develop the U.S.-South Korea relationship \"into a future-oriented, comprehensive strategic alliance.\"",
      "Lee also promised \"stable management of Korea-China relations, promotion of Korea-Russia diplomacy,\" and to prioritize South Korea's national interests.",
      "He has vowed to invest up to 100 trillion won (about $73 billion) to fund artificial intelligence work in the country, aiming to make South Korea one of the top three global AI powerhouses.",
      "But Lee has offered little in the way of firm, specific commitments, and many South Koreans remained unclear about what kind of diplomatic policies he might adopt when he takes the country's highest office.",
      "Before South Korea descended into internal political chaos in late 2024, the former conservative government had taken a hard line on North Korea and Kim Jong Un's isolated regime, fueling higher tension across the two countries' heavily militarized border.",

      "According to intercepted communications, the 33-year-old also spent 47 million euros on 975 kilograms of gold over less than six months.",
      "The kingpin additionally bought real estate including a hotel in Turkey and apartments in Dubai, the prosecutors alleged.",
      "Luxury goods including two Bentley cars, designer bags, jewellery and watches, were also added to the total of illicit assets, bringing the total to $253 million.",
      "\"This is ... only a first step towards tracing Leijdekkers' assets,\" the prosecutors said.",
      "A Rotterdam court last June sentenced Leijdekkers in absentia to 24 years in prison for ordering a murder and organizing cocaine shipments.",
      "He is on Europol's most-wanted list, with the European police body offering over $225,000 for information leading to his arrest.",
      "\"Leijdekkers is considered to be one of the key players in international cocaine trafficking,\" according to Europol.",
      "In January, Dutch authorities said they were \"absolutely certain\" he was hiding out in Sierra Leone. The\u00a0BBC reported\u00a0that Dutch prosecutor Wim de Bruin said the fugitive's return to the Netherlands was of \"the highest priority.\"",
      "Images apparently showing Leijdekkers in the company of officials as high as President Julius Maada Bio have sparked speculation the cocaine lord has cozied up to Sierra Leone's political class \u2014 including the president's daughter.",
      "Suspicions he was in Sierra Leone arose after the country's first lady Fatima Bio posted pictures and a video on social media that showed a man strongly resembling Leijdekkers at a religious service, also attended by President Bio.",
      "Exiled Sierra Leone opposition figure Mohamed Mansaray has accused Bio and his government of \"offering refuge\" to the drug lord.",
      "According to Mansaray, Leijdekkers has coupled up with the president's daughter Agnes Bio, who is seen accompanying the drug lord in the images.",
      "Leijdekkers is also believed to be involved in the disappearance and death of Naima Jillal, a woman who went missing in 2019 after she got into a car in Amsterdam,\u00a0according to Europol. Intercepted messages allegedly showed that Leijdekkers \"played an important role in Jillal's disappearance,\" the agency said.",
      "\"For a long time, there was no trace of Naima Jillal, until photos of a woman believed to be her were found on a phone seized in the Marengo investigation,\" Europol said. \"The photos show that she was most likely tortured and is probably no longer alive.\"",

      "The five members of local band Fugitivo had been hired for a weekend performance in the crime-wracked northeastern city of Reynosa, but arrived to find a vacant lot. Their bodies were found several days later after their families reported receiving ransom demands.",
      "\"An operation was carried out on three properties\" in Reynosa, the public security office said in a statement, adding that the three suspects had been arrested there.",
      "Investigators said the musicians had been kidnapped on May 25 while driving to a private event. Nine alleged cartel members were arrested last week, with authorities announcing another sting on Monday.",
      "Prosecutors said the nine people arrested last week were believed to be part of a faction of the\u00a0Gulf Cartel, which has strong presence in the city, but they did not indicate if the three new suspects arrested had the same links.",
      "During the newest operation, weapons, weapons cartridges, cocaine and methamphetamines were also seized, the ministry added.",

Young artists sometimes pay homage to leaders of drug cartels, often portrayed as Robin Hood-type figures.",
      "It was not immediately clear if Fugitivo played such songs or if the artists were simply victims of rampant cartel violence that has eclipsed the city.",

      "Such performers often live in close proximity to their drug lord patrons, and can at times get caught up in gang turf battles.",
      "\"Narcocorridos\" are a controversial sub-genre of music in Mexico, and the songs have caught the attention of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who recently launched a music contest \"for peace and against addictions,\" seeking to counter the popularity of the music among young people in Mexico and the United States.",

    "story": [
      "South Koreans are voting for a new president in a snap election triggered by the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative who is facing rebellion charges over his short-lived imposition of martial law late last year.",
      "Voting began at 6 a.m. local time Tuesday at more than 14,000 polling stations nationwide, the election commission said. Voting ends at 8 p.m. local time, and observers say the winner could emerge as early as midnight.",
      "More than 15 million people had already voted during a two-day early voting period last week, accounting for nearly 35% of the country's 44.4 million eligible voters.",
      "Pre-election surveys suggest Yoon's liberal archrival, Lee Jae-myung, appears headed for an easy win, riding a wave of public frustration over conservatives in the wake of Yoon's martial law debacle. In a Facebook post, Lee called for voters to \"deliver a stern and resolute judgement\" against conservatives following the months of political turmoil.",
      "Meanwhile, the main conservative candidate, Kim Moon-soo, has struggled to win over moderate, swing voters.",
      "This election serves as another defining moment in the country's resilient democracy, but observers worry a domestic divide worsened by Yoon is far from over and could pose a big political burden on the new president.",
      "The winning candidate will immediately be sworn in as president for a single, full term of five years without the typical two-month transition period. The new president will face major challenges, including a slowing economy, President Trump's America-first policies and North Korea's evolving nuclear threats.",

      "\"If they somehow win, that would mean the return of the rebellion forces, the destruction of democracy, the deprival of people's human rights, the normalization of martial law and our country's downfall into a backward, third-world nation,\" Lee told the crowd gathered at a Seoul park.",
      "Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, warned that a Lee win would allow him to wield excessive power, launch political retaliation against opponents and legislate laws to protect him from various legal troubles, as his party already controls parliament.",
      "Lee \"is now trying to seize all power in South Korea and establish a Hitler-like dictatorship,\" Kim told a rally in the southeastern city of Busan.",
      "North Korea relations unclear",
      "Relations with North Korea remain badly strained since 2019, with the North focused on expanding its nuclear arsenal while refusing dialogue with South Korea and the U.S.",
      "Since his second term began in January, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his intent to resume diplomacy with North Korean leader\u00a0Kim Jong Un, but Kim has so far ignored the offer while making Russia his priority in foreign policy.",
      "Lee, who wants warmer ties with North Korea, recently acknowledged it would be \"very difficult\" to realize a summit with Kim Jong Un anytime soon. Lee said he would support Mr. Trump's push to restart talks with Kim Jong Un, which he believed would eventually allow South Korea to be involved in some projects in North Korea.",
      "Foreign policy strategists for Lee understand there isn't much South Korea can do to bring about a denuclearization of North Korea, said Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University.",

      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said a Biden-era 2024 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rule that restricted energy development for more than half of the 23 million acres on Alaska\u2019s North Slope ignored the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976.",
      "\"The National Petroleum Reserve (NPR), created by Congress over a century ago to secure America\u2019s energy supply, supports responsible oil development on 13 million acres,\" Frank Lasee, president of Truth in Energy and Climate, said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.",

      "\"President Biden\u2019s drilling ban in Alaska undermined energy security, increasing reliance on foreign oil, raising gasoline prices and fueling inflation through higher transportation costs,\" Lasee added. \"Resuming drilling puts economic growth and energy independence ahead of climate ideology in a place almost no regular American will ever visit.\"",

      "\"President Biden never should have halted congressionally sanctioned oil drilling in Alaska,\" said Sterling Burnett, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at the Heartland Institute. \"Trump is to be applauded, both for putting Americans' energy needs and our economic well-being first and for following the law by opening these areas back up for production.\"",
      "According to the Department of Interior, the 2024 rule provisions lacked \"a basis in the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act\" and undermined the BLM's congressional obligation to oversee timely leasing in the region.",

      "\"By reversing Biden\u2019s disastrous restrictions on 13 million acres, Trump is unleashing the abundant resources that power our economy, lower energy costs and strengthen national security. This is a victory for American workers, consumers and allies who rely on stable, affordable energy,\" Isaac added.",

      "\"The National Petroleum Reserve (NPR) was created more than 100 years ago specifically to provide a supply of oil for America\u2019s energy security. That energy security can be achieved by responsibly developing our oil reserves, including in the Gulf of America, our vast shale oil deposits in America\u2019s heartland and, now, thankfully, the 13 million acres of the NPR that are going to be developed,\" said Gregory Whitestone, CO2 Coalition executive director.",

      "Have you ever wished you could skip the traffic and just fly to your destination in the same vehicle you drove to the airport? That\u2019s exactly what the Klein Vision AirCar is promising. After more than 30 years of development, this flying car is finally about to become a reality for early buyers.",

      "A dream decades in the making",
      "The story of\u00a0AirCar begins in Slovakia, where designer \u0160tefan Klein and his team have been working on flying cars since the late 1980s. After years of prototypes and over 500 test flights, the AirCar is finally set for certification later this year. Customer deliveries are planned for early 2026, and the company even has plans for an amphibious version that could land on water.",

      "RADICAL NEW TECH BRINGS FLYING CARS CLOSER TO REALITY",
      "From the road to the sky in minutes",
      "So, how does it work? The AirCar looks like a sleek sports coupe on the road, with four wheels and a design that would fit right in next to a luxury sedan. When you need to fly, you simply drive to a runway, press a button and watch as the wings unfold and the tail extends. The transformation takes about 80 seconds, and there's no manual tinkering required. Once the wings are locked and the tail is in place, you're ready for takeoff. The steering wheel transforms into a flight yoke, and extra pedals appear for rudder control. The controls are designed to be intuitive for pilots, so if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't need to learn anything new.",

      "Under the hood, the production AirCar will offer three engine options, all 3.2-liter V6s from South African company Adept Airmotive. The base model puts out 280 horsepower, while the top version offers 340 horsepower with twin turbos. On the road, the AirCar can reach a top speed of about 124 mph, and it handles and feels much like a sports car. In the air, it cruises at 155 mph and can travel up to 620 miles on a single tank of fuel.",
      "The cabin is not pressurized, so the recommended ceiling is 10,000 feet, but it could go higher with oxygen tanks. The AirCar runs on regular high-octane gasoline, and you can fill up at most gas stations. In terms of size, it is about as long as a Mercedes S-Class and narrow enough to fit in a standard parking spot.",

      "THIS FLYING MOTORCYCLE CAN TAKE YOU FROM TRAFFIC TO SKY IN MINUTES",
      "What licenses do you need to drive and fly the AirCar?",
      "To operate the AirCar on the road, you will need a standard driver's license, just like any other car. If you want to take to the skies, you'll also need a private pilot's license. According to Klein Vision, the AirCar is designed so that if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't have to learn anything new to fly it.

      "AirCar (Klein Vision) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does it compare to other flying cars?",
      "Unlike many flying car projects that never make it past the prototype stage, the AirCar is close to full certification and production. It is also one of the few with four wheels, making it truly road-legal in most places.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Given the number of phishing scams we have all faced over the past decade, most of us have developed a basic skill to spot and avoid obvious phishing emails or SMS messages. Cybercriminals are aware of this, and they have evolved their tactics by shifting to more complex and convincing schemes designed to bypass skepticism and lure victims.",
      "Their goal remains the same: to trick you into handing over sensitive information, especially credit card data. One of the latest examples is the rise in subscription scam campaigns. Scammers are creating incredibly convincing websites selling everything from shoes and clothes to electronics, tricking people into signing up for monthly subscriptions and willingly providing their credit card information. Facebook is being used as the primary platform to promote these new and sophisticated scams.",

      "A woman shopping online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Bitdefender researchers have uncovered a massive and highly coordinated subscription scam campaign involving more than 200 active websites designed to look like real online stores. These sites, often promoted through Facebook ads, sell everything from clothes and electronics to beauty products, but the real goal is to trick users into signing up for recurring payments, often without realizing it.",
      "One of the most common lures is the \"mystery box\" scam, where you are promised a surprise package at a bargain price. These offers are made to look fun and harmless, but behind the scenes you are giving away personal and credit card information while unknowingly agreeing to hidden subscription terms, often written in tiny fine print.",
      "The scam doesn\u2019t stop there. Once you\u2019re convinced and reach the checkout page, scammers often layer in a second scam, like loyalty cards or VIP memberships that further lock you into payments. It\u2019s all designed to confuse you, overwhelm you with supposed perks and make the scam feel like a good deal.",
      "Researchers found that many of these websites share a single Cyprus address, possibly tied to offshore entities linked to the Paradise Papers. Despite being spread across different categories and brand names, the sites often use the same layouts, AI agents and payment structures, all pointing to a centralized fraud network.",
      "Scammers frequently rotate the brands they impersonate and have started moving beyond mystery boxes, now peddling low-quality products, counterfeit goods, fake investment schemes, dubious supplements and more. To avoid automatic detection, they employ several tactics. These include running multiple versions of an ad, with only one of which is actually malicious while the others display harmless product images, uploading ad images from platforms like Google Drive so they can be swapped out later and cropping visuals to alter recognizable patterns.",

Users are promised deep discounts or access to exclusive deals, but in reality they\u2019re just being locked into recurring payments.",
      "Many of the scam websites trace back to the same physical address in Cyprus, pointing to what appears to be a centralized operation. Researchers also found links to entities mentioned in the Paradise Papers, suggesting these fraudsters are hiding behind offshore infrastructure.",
      "And it\u2019s not just mystery boxes anymore. The same scam format is being used to sell low-quality goods, fake supplements and even bogus investment opportunities.

      "10 proactive measures to take to protect your data",
      "Even as scammers become more sophisticated, there are practical steps you can take right now to protect your personal and financial information from subscription fraud and other online threats. Here are ten proactive measures to help keep your data safe:",
      "1) Always read the fine print: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from subscription scams is to slow down and read the fine print, especially on checkout pages. Scammers often hide recurring payment terms in small or lightly colored text that\u2019s easy to miss. What seems like a one-time purchase could actually sign you up for a biweekly or monthly charge. Taking just a moment to scan for hidden terms before hitting \"Pay\" can help you avoid weeks of silent billing.",
      "2) Avoid mystery box or VIP-style deals:\u00a0These offers often prey on curiosity and the promise of surprise or luxury for a low fee. In reality, the \"mystery\" is the trap: you might receive nothing or a low-quality item while being unknowingly enrolled in a recurring subscription. Scammers use the illusion of exclusivity or urgency to pressure quick decisions.",
      "3) Don\u2019t trust ads blindly on social media:\u00a0Facebook, Instagram and other platforms are a hotbed for these scams, with criminals running paid ads that mimic well-known brands or influencers. These ads often link to professional-looking but fake storefronts. If you\u2019re interested in a deal you see online, don\u2019t click through immediately. Instead, look up the brand or offer in a separate tab and check if it exists outside social media.",
      "4) Investigate before you buy:\u00a0Before purchasing from any unfamiliar site, take a few quick steps to verify its legitimacy. Search the brand's name alongside words like \"scam\" or \"reviews\" to see what others have experienced. Look up the company's physical address and check if it actually exists using tools like Google Maps. Make sure the website uses HTTPS, review the site's contact information and cross-check reviews on trusted third-party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports.",
      "5) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Adding a strong antivirus program to your devices can provide an extra layer of defense against fraudulent websites and phishing attempts. Strong antivirus software warns you about suspicious links, blocks malicious ads and scans downloads for malware. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Scammers often rely on leaked or publicly available personal information to target victims with convincing subscription scams. Investing in a personal data removal service can help minimize your digital footprint by removing your information from data broker databases and reducing the chances of being targeted in future campaigns. Regularly monitoring and cleaning up your online presence makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your data for financial gain.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "7) Be cautious with payment methods: Use secure payment options like credit cards, which often offer better fraud protection than wire transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency.",
      "8) Limit personal information shared on social media: Scammers often gather details from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Review your privacy settings and only share necessary information.",
      "9) Use strong, unique passwords and enable multifactor authentication:\u00a0Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, especially those tied to your finances or shopping. Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible, as this adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10) Keep your devices and software updated:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and apps. Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that scammers exploit to gain access to your information or install malicious software.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While the rise of subscription scams and deceptive ads is concerning, it\u2019s especially troubling that platforms like Facebook continue to allow these fraudulent ads to run unchecked. Facebook has repeatedly failed to adequately vet or prevent these malicious campaigns from reaching vulnerable individuals. The platform\u2019s ad approval system should be more proactive in spotting and blocking ads promoting scams, particularly those that impersonate well-known brands or content creators.",

      "Despite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm.",
      "The robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw.",

      "6 ways you can protect yourself from infostealer malware",
      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of infostealer malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider taking these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0\u200bCheck out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Lumma had become a go-to tool for cybercriminals, targeting everything from browser credentials to crypto wallets across Windows and Mac systems. I\u2019ve been tracking this malware since early 2024, and its ability to impersonate human verification pages and abuse expired cookies made it especially dangerous.",

Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data.",
      "3. Watch for unusual account activity: After a breach, it\u2019s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions.",
      "4. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser.",

Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Keep your software and devices up to date: Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even apps\u00a0need to be updated regularly to patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you\u2019re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system.",

The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent.

      "For Brad G. Smith, this became his reality after being diagnosed with ALS, a rare and progressive disease that attacks the nerves controlling voluntary muscle movement.",
      "But thanks to a groundbreaking Neuralink brain implant, Smith is now able to communicate with the world using only his thoughts.",

      "ALS patient Brad G. Smith and his family. (Bradford G. Smith/X)",
      "Life before Neuralink",
      "Before receiving the\u00a0Neuralink implant, Smith relied on eye-tracking technology to communicate. While impressive, it came with major limitations.\u00a0\"It is a miracle of technology, but it is frustrating. It works best in dark rooms, so I was basically Batman. I was stuck in a dark room,\"\u00a0Smith shared in a\u00a0recent post on X. Bright environments would disrupt the system, making communication slow and sometimes impossible. Now, Smith says,\u00a0\"Neuralink lets me go outside and ignore lighting changes.\"",

      "How the Neuralink brain implant works",
      "Smith is the first non-verbal person and only the third individual worldwide to receive the Neuralink Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The device, about as thick as five stacked coins, sits in his skull and connects to the motor cortex-the part of the brain that controls movement.",
      "Tiny wires, thinner than human hair, extend into Smith's brain. These pick up signals from his neurons and transmit them wirelessly to his MacBook Pro. The computer then decodes these signals, allowing Smith to move a cursor on the screen with his thoughts alone.",
      "As Smith explains, \"The Neuralink implant embedded in my brain contains 1024 electrodes that capture neuron firings every 15 milliseconds generating a vast amount of data. Artificial intelligence processes this data on a connected MacBook Pro to decode my intended movements in real time to move the cursor on my screen. Neuralink does not read my deepest thoughts or words I think about. It just reads how I wanna move and moves the cursor where I want.\"",

      "Training the brain-computer connection",
      "Learning to use the system took some trial and error. At first, the team tried mapping Smith's hand movements to the cursor, but it didn't work well. After more research, they discovered that signals related to his tongue were the most effective for cursor movement, and clenching his jaw worked best for clicking.\u00a0\"I am not actively thinking about my tongue, just like you don't think about your wrist when you move a mouse. I have done a lot of cursor movements in my life. I think my brain has switched over to subconscious control quickly so I just think about moving the cursor,\"\u00a0Smith said.",

      "The Neuralink implant has given Smith new ways to interact with his family and the world. He can now play games like Mario Kart with his children and communicate more quickly than before. The system includes a virtual keyboard and shortcuts for common actions, making tasks like copying, pasting and navigating web pages much easier.",
      "Smith also worked with Neuralink engineers to develop a \"parking spot\" feature for the cursor.\u00a0\"Sometimes you just wanna park the cursor and watch a video. When it is in the parking spot, I can watch a show or take a nap without worrying about the cursor,\" he explained.",

      "To speed up communication even more, Smith uses Grok, Elon Musk's AI chatbot. Grok helps him write responses and even suggests witty replies. \"We have created a chat app that uses AI to listen to the conversation and gives me options to say in response. It uses Grok 3 and an AI clone of my old voice to generate options for me to say. It is not perfect, but it keeps me in the conversation and it comes up with some great ideas,\" Smith shared. One example? When a friend needed a gift idea for his girlfriend who loves horses, the AI suggested a bouquet of carrots.",

      "The human side: Family, faith and perspective",
      "Smith's journey has been shaped by more than just technology. He credits his wife, Tiffany, as his\u00a0\"best caregiver I could ever imagine,\" and recognizes the support of his kids, friends and family. Despite the challenges of ALS, Smith finds meaning and hope in his faith.\u00a0\"I have not always understood why God afflicted me with ALS but with time I am learning to trust his plan for me. I'm a better man because of ALS. I'm a better disciple of Jesus Christ because of ALS. I'm closer to my amazing wife, literally and figuratively, because of ALS,\" he said.",

As Smith puts it, \"Neuralink is giving me freedom, hope and faster communication. Overall, the whole Neuralink experience has been fantastic. It has improved my life so much. I'm so happy to be involved in something big that will help many people.\"\u00a0While ALS \"really sucks,\" as Smith says, his journey shows how innovation and determination can bring light to even the darkest rooms.

    "summary": "Here are five AI prompts you can use for freelance work, writing product descriptions, creating social media posts and writing emails to negotiate discounts.",
    "story": [
      "A majority of small businesses are using artificial intelligence and finding out it can save time and money.",
      "So, you want to start making money using AI but you\u2019re not trying to build Skynet or learn 15 coding languages first? Good, because neither am I. You don\u2019t need to become the next Sam Altman or have a Ph.D. in machine learning to turn artificial intelligence into real income. What you do need is curiosity, a dash of creativity, and the right prompts.",
      "\ud83d\udcb8 Enter to win $500 for you and $500 for your favorite person or charity in our\u00a0Pay It Forward Sweepstakes. Hurry, ends soon!",
      "I\u2019ve pulled together five powerful, practical prompts you can throw into ChatGPT (or your AI tool of choice) to help you start earning extra cash this week. These aren\u2019t pie-in-the-sky dreams or $10K-a-month YouTube ad schemes. They\u2019re doable, even if your calendar is already packed.",
      "5-MINUTE CLEANUP FOR YOUR PHONE AND COMPUTER",
      "Let\u2019s get to it.",
      "1. Fast-Track Your Freelance Life",
      "Prompt to use:\"Act as a freelance business coach. Suggest 3 services I can offer on Fiverr or Upwork using AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney or Canva. I have [insert skill: writing/design/admin/accounting/managerial] experience.\"",
      "Why this works:Freelance work is exploding right now. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are filled with small businesses and entrepreneurs who need help\u2014but don\u2019t have the budget to hire full-time staff. If you\u2019ve got any kind of professional background, you can use AI tools to turbocharge your services. Writing blog posts? ChatGPT can give you a draft. Creating logos or social media templates? Midjourney and Canva are your new best friends.",
      "You don\u2019t need a team. You don\u2019t need fancy software. You just need a good prompt and the confidence to say, \"Yes, I can do that.\" AI helps you scale what you already know how to do.",
      "A man is pictured with a smartphone and laptop computer on January 31, 2019.\u00a0 (Neil Godwin/Future via Getty Images)",
      "2. Make Product Descriptions Sexy Again",
      "Prompt to use:\"Rewrite this Etsy or Shopify product description to make it more compelling and SEO-friendly. Target audience: [insert group]. Here\u2019s the original: [paste description].\"",
      "Why this works:Let\u2019s face it\u2014most product descriptions online are a snooze. But good copy sells. Whether you\u2019re running your own shop or helping someone else with theirs, compelling product descriptions convert clicks into customers. Use ChatGPT to punch up the language, fine-tune for SEO, and speak directly to your ideal buyer.",
      "DON\u2019T SCAM YOURSELF WITH THE TRICKS HACKERS DON\u2019T WANT ME TO SHARE",
      "Remember: people don\u2019t just want to buy a weird mug. They want to buy what it says about them. That\u2019s where a smart rewrite can turn browsers into buyers.",
      "3. Social Posts That Sell",
      "Prompt to use:\"Create 5 attention-grabbing Instagram captions to promote this [product/service]. Keep the tone [fun, confident, expert] and include a strong call to action.\"",
      "Why this works:We live in a scroll-happy world. Your social captions need to grab attention in less than three seconds. But not everyone\u2019s a copywriter\u2014and not everyone has time to be. AI can help you crank out engaging content in the tone and style that fits your brand. Add a great photo, post consistently, and you\u2019re suddenly a one-person content agency without the overhead (or endless Zoom meetings).",

      "If you\u2019re managing social for clients or your own biz, this prompt is gold. Use it to build content calendars, write reels scripts, or even draft ad copy.",
      "4. Polite Emails That Save You Money",
      "Prompt to use:\"Write a short, polite email to ask for a lower rate or discount on [tool/service/platform]. Mention that I\u2019m a loyal customer comparing alternatives.\"",
      "Why this works:Negotiating discounts doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable but it absolutely works. Companies often have unpublished deals, especially for longtime users or small businesses. And customer service reps? They're human beings. A kind, well-written email might be all it takes to get a discount on that software you\u2019re using every month.",
      "20 TECH TRICKS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER, SAFER OR EASIER",
      "I\u2019ve personally saved hundreds of dollars just by sending quick, respectful emails like this. AI can help you strike the perfect tone confident but kind, assertive but not pushy.",
      "5. Your Passive Income Kit",
      "Prompt to use:\"Give me 3 high-demand, low-competition ideas for a short e-book or low-content book I can sell on Amazon. I have experience in [insert topic].\"",
      "Why this works:You have knowledge people want. Package it. Sell it. Repeat. Whether it\u2019s a short guide on starting a backyard garden or a workbook for productivity hacks, e-books and low-content books (like journals or planners) sell surprisingly well. And AI can help you brainstorm ideas, outline chapters, even draft content to polish up.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software.",
      "All modern Windows PCs come with Microsoft Defender built in. For the unaware, this tool is Windows\u2019 native antivirus.",
      "Over time, it has matured into a reliable security tool capable of blocking a wide range of threats. However, a tool called Defendnot can shut down Microsoft Defender completely, without exploiting a bug or using malware. It simply convinces Windows that another antivirus is already running.",
      "The implications are serious. This tool does not break into the system or use advanced code injection. It uses Windows features the way they were designed to be used. And that makes the problem harder to detect and harder to fix.",

      "Windows software on a PC (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The tool works by pretending to be an antivirus",
      "Windows is built to avoid running multiple antivirus products at once. When a third-party antivirus registers itself, Windows disables Microsoft Defender to prevent conflicts. Defendnot\u00a0exploits this system using an undocumented API that security software uses to communicate with the Windows Security Center.",
      "The tool registers a fake antivirus that appears legitimate to the system. It uses a dummy DLL and injects it into Task Manager, a trusted Windows process. By operating inside this signed process, Defendnot avoids signature checks and permission blocks. Once the fake antivirus is registered, Windows disables Microsoft Defender without warning or confirmation.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "No security alert is shown to the user. No visible changes are made to indicate that the system is unprotected. Unless someone checks manually, the machine remains open to attacks with no real-time protection running.",
      "The tool also includes options to set a custom antivirus name, enable logging and configure automatic startup. It achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs whenever the user logs in.",

      "WINDOWS DEFENDER VS ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE: FREE PROTECTION FALLS SHORT",
      "From GitHub takedown to a fresh build",
      "Defendnot is based on an earlier project called No-Defender. That project used code from an actual antivirus product to fake registration. It gained attention quickly and was removed after a copyright complaint from the vendor whose code had been reused. The developer took the project down and walked away from it.",
      "With Defendnot, the creator rebuilt the core features using original code. This version avoids copyright issues and uses a new method to achieve the same effect. It does not rely on another antivirus or third-party binaries. It was written from scratch to demonstrate how simple it is to manipulate Windows security from inside the system.",
      "Microsoft Defender currently flags the tool as a threat. It detects and quarantines it under the name Win32/Sabsik.FL.!ml. However, the fact that it works at all points to a weakness in how Windows handles antivirus registration and trust.",

      "While Defendnot is a research project, there\u2019s a chance that similar tools are already out there and could be used to compromise your PC. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe:",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Even with regular updates, Windows systems can be left exposed by tools like Defendnot that silently disable built-in defenses. A strong third-party antivirus with real-time protection and frequent updates provides essential backup security. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3. Avoid running unexpected commands: Never paste or run commands (like PowerShell scripts) you don\u2019t understand or that were copied from random websites. Attackers often trick users into unknowingly running malware this way.",
      "4. Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and all software applications. Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA on all your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Even with strong device security, your personal information may still be exposed online through data brokers and people-finder sites. These services collect and publish details like your name, address and phone number, making you an easier target for identity theft or phishing. Automated data removal services track down these sites and submit removal requests on your behalf, helping to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online anonymity. While they can't erase every trace of your information, they make it significantly harder for attackers to find and exploit your personal data, which saves you time and reduces unwanted spam in the process.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Defendnot points to a bigger issue with how Windows handles security. It takes a feature meant to prevent software conflicts and turns it into a way to completely disable protection. The system assumes any registered antivirus is legitimate, so if attackers can fake that, they get in without much resistance.",
      "We often think of security as blocking the bad and trusting the good. But this case shows what happens when that trust is misplaced. Defendnot doesn\u2019t sneak past Windows defenses. It walks right in using valid credentials. The solution isn\u2019t just more patches or stronger malware signatures. What we need is a smarter way for systems to tell what is actually safe.",

The top speed is an impressive 28 mph, and you can travel up to 25 miles on a single charge. The Hydroflyer Sport's modular design lets you swap out parts or customize your setup.

      "The new approach comes as President Donald Trump has warned European nations to take more responsibility for their own security. Starmer's announcement focused on a \"new era\" of threats, citing the war in Ukraine, new nuclear risks and \"daily cyberattacks,\" as well as reversing the post-Cold War defense decline. He called out \"growing Russian aggression\" in U.K. waters and skies, blaming \"their reckless actions\" for the increased cost of living \"hitting working people the hardest.\"",
      "\"The threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer said.",

Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and in cyberspace.",
      "The second change, Starmer explained from Scotland, is ensuring \"everything we do will add to the strength of NATO.\"",
      "\"As we step up to take greater responsibility for our collective defense, the NATO alliance means something profound, that we will never fight alone,\" Starmer said. \"It is a fundamental source of our strategic strength. That's why our defense policy will always be NATO first, something that's written through this review. The transformation we are driving in our defense must add up to Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation. So that when we're building new capabilities at home, we are making our allies safer too, strengthening Europe, and strengthening our bridge to the US as Britain's first partner in defense.\"",

      "RUBIO DEMANDS NATO PONY UP, DISMISSES 'HYSTERIA' OVER US ROLE UNDER TRUMP",
      "The third change laid out by Starmer is for the U.K. to \"innovate and accelerate at a wartime pace so we can meet the threats of today and of tomorrow as the fastest innovator in NATO.\" He said such advancements would not mean \"replacing people\" or hardware, but would rather mean \"learning the lessons of Ukraine\" and ensuring \"every capability we have works seamlessly together.\"",
      "\"Drones, destroyers, AI, aircraft, each different branch of our armed services, fully integrated to create an army which is 10 times more lethal by 2035,\" Starmer said.",

      "For the first time, Syrians are openly calling for peace with Israel. In an interview with Fox News Digital, journalist Furat Alali from Damascus said, \"We want a future without wars. We want to live. People are not afraid to speak up anymore.\"",
      "Her statement reflects a significant shift in the country\u2019s political landscape, as many Syrians begin to openly discuss the prospect of peace with Israel. This change comes at a time when Syria and Israel are engaged in direct talks as Reuters revealed on Tuesday, marking a dramatic departure from the decades-long hostility between the two nations.",

      "Sources familiar with the discussions have indicated that the U.S. has played a pivotal role in facilitating these talks, encouraging Syria\u2019s new leadership to engage with Israel.",
      "The discussions come after a shift in U.S. policy, following President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa earlier this month. The meeting signaled a break from decades of U.S. hostility toward Syria\u2019s Assad regime and opened the door to potential normalization between Syria and Israel.",
      "While the talks are still in the early stages, Trump\u2019s engagement has raised the possibility of Syria\u2019s leadership eventually normalizing ties with Israel, although this process will likely take time.",
      "Furat Alali explained: \"We don\u2019t want to be part of the Axis of Resistance anymore. The Palestinian cause has been used to oppress us. We feel sympathy for the Palestinians, but now we need to focus on Syria and our future.\"",

We are thinking about our own interests now. The idea of exploiting the Palestinian cause to oppress the Syrian people has been rejected. We are tired of this.\"",
      "Another young woman interviewed by Jusoor News, a Pan-Arab media outlet, shared similar thoughts: \"We are for anything that serves our country\u2019s interest. We\u2019ve lived through difficult times. The country\u2019s economy is very weak. It\u2019s time for people to live.\"",

      "The shift in Syria\u2019s stance on Israel is significant, especially given the historical enmity between the two nations. For decades, Syria and Israel have been locked in conflict, with the status of the Golan Heights remaining a key point of contention since its capture by Israel during the 1967 war. Syria\u2019s involvement in the Axis of Resistance, aligning with Iran and Hezbollah against Israel, has been a cornerstone of its foreign policy.",
      "However, the recent emergence of interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa has raised new possibilities, as well as concerns.",
      "Furat Ali said, \"I was one of the journalists who extensively covered the violations of Jabhat al-Nusra before the fall of the Assad regime, the group Al-Jolani emerged from (using his previous name), which was part of al-Qaeda. I know exactly what they did. So, when I first heard that Al-Jolani was taking over Aleppo and challenging Assad, I was scared.\"",

      "\"But as time went on,\" she added, \"when he rebranded himself as Ahmed al-Sharaa and promised a new direction, I saw he was smart. He managed to convince the West to lift sanctions and engage with him, bringing back international recognition for Syria. While we remain skeptical and cautious, what we\u2019re seeing from Sharaa domestically is so far being accepted.\"",
      "Joseph Braude,\u00a0founder and president of the Center for Peace Communications,\u00a0highlighted the significance of the shift in public opinion within Syria. He noted, \"People in Syria and Lebanon often associate the Palestinian issue with dictators who exploited it to justify corruption and brutality. There is a growing rejection of pro-Palestinian militancy, as many people now desire to turn the page and focus on new partnerships aimed at developing their own countries.",

    "summary": "Consumers are trying to saving money by preparing more meals at home and dining out less, boosting demand for pantry staples while denting snack brands and fast-food chains.",
    "story": [
      "The humble bowl of soup is having a moment.",
      "That\u2019s according to The Campbell\u2019s Co., whose iconic cans are synonymous with it. The food maker said Monday that customers are increasingly snatching up its condensed soups and mac-and-cheese offerings while shying away from snacks, a spending shift that partly echoes the depths of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cConsumers are cooking at home at the highest levels since early 2020,\u201d Campbell\u2019s CEO Mick Beekhuizen said in a statement.",
      "The company \u2014 whose snack brands include Goldfish, Snyder\u2019s of Hanover pretzels and Cape Cod chips \u2014 saw snack sales slip 5% in the last three months. Meanwhile, sales of its meals and beverages rose 6%, mainly driven by Rao\u2019s pasta sauces and soup sales in the United States.",
      "While consumers\u2019 outlooks have improved somewhat in recent weeks, many remain deeply pessimistic about the direction of the economy under President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-shifting trade war and are looking for bargains.",
      "Households continue to \u201cfocus their spending on products that help them stretch their food budgets, and they\u2019re increasingly intentional about their discretionary snack purchases,\u201d Beekhuizen told Campbell\u2019s investors on its earnings call.",
      "\u201cSnacks are losing ground as consumers, squeezed by inflation, shift spending toward essentials and more purposeful food choices,\u201d analysts at the market research firm NIQ wrote in a recent note. \u201cThe era of indulgent, impulsive snacking is giving way to a demand for value, quality, and health.\u201d",
      "In a recent NIQ survey, 42% of consumers reported buying snacks  less, and 37% said they\u2019re searching harder for deals. Many indicated they\u2019ve been thinking twice about pricier name-brand snacks, opting instead for more generic alternatives at convenience stores or those sold under supermarkets\u2019 own private labels.",
      "Snacks are losing ground as consumers, squeezed by inflation, shift spending toward essentials.",
      "NIQ market researchers",
      "The tightening snack market has seen some friction, with Oreo maker Mondel\u0113z recently suing Aldi, alleging the supermarket operator had \u201cblatantly\u201d mimicked some of its packaging designs for cheaper riffs on iconic snack brands.",
      "While Mondel\u0113z says snack demand remains sturdy, PepsiCo \u2014 which makes Lay\u2019s and Doritos chips \u2014 has said it\u2019s finding success catering to customers at lower price points. \u201cRelative to where we were three months ago, we probably aren\u2019t feeling as good about the consumer now as we were a few months ago,\u201d PepsiCo CFO Jamie Caulfield said in April. The snack foods giant also lowered its financial forecast for the year.",
      "Food shoppers\u2019 hunt for value is also boosting Dollar General, which Tuesday increased its sales outlook for the year and said it picked up market share in food products. The dollar store operator notched those gains even as other retail giants, such as Target, that sell groceries have struggled to lure budget-conscious shoppers.",
      "The growing focus on home cooking comes as costs of dining out are rising nearly twice as fast as grocery prices. Meals out were up 3.9% in April from a year earlier, federal data show, while at-home food prices rose just 2% over the same period, slower than inflation overall.",
      "That divergence helps explain why many restaurant chains are seeing weaker sales. McDonald\u2019s last month reported its biggest same-store sales decline since the pandemic, with that measure falling 3.6% during the first quarter. Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden, also flagged weaker-than-expected sales around the start of the year, and Chipotle reported its same-store sales contracted for the first time since 2020.",
      "McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said all but its most affluent diners are increasingly staying away from the burger chain, despite the past year\u2019s efforts to counter its earlier menu price hikes with value meals. Traffic from low-income consumers was down \u201cnearly double digits\u201d compared to a year ago, with middle-income diners\u2019 visits slowing \u201cnearly as much,\u201d he said.",
      "Kempczinski said the split illustrated a \u201cdivided\u201d economy in which moderately and less well-off consumers \u201care being weighed down by the cumulative impact of inflation and heightened anxiety about the economic outlook.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, restaurant operators are doing what they can to try to juice sales. Some are leaning into customers\u2019 growing appetite for chicken, refreshing their locations with sleek new looks, or both.",
      "These efforts could prove an uphill battle against the grocery aisle, where the costs of some key purchases, like eggs, are finally easing. But there are still signs of strain at supermarket checkouts as shoppers adjust to higher overall costs for many of the fridge and pantry basics they can\u2019t easily do without. More shoppers are both financing their grocery purchases with installment loans and falling behind on those bills, a recent LendingTree survey found.",
      "One such \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d service, Klarna, said recently that its borrowers are having a tougher time clearing their debts on the platform. Months earlier, the company became Walmart\u2019s exclusive BNPL provider and teamed up with DoorDash to offer installment loans for takeout meals."

      "A liberal lawyer was elected president of South Korea on Tuesday, ending months of political instability in the key U.S. ally that began with a botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the Democratic Party, was sworn into office Wednesday. His conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, of the People Power Party, said he humbly accepted \u201cthe choice of the people.\u201d",
      "According to the National Election Commission, Lee received 49.4% of the vote, while Kim received just over 41%. Another conservative candidate, Lee Jun-seok of the upstart Reform Party, received 8.3%.",
      "In his inauguration speech, Lee, 61, emphasized national unity after the martial law episode and said he would be \u201ca president who ends the politics of division.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will fully uncover the truth, assign proper responsibility and establish firm measures to prevent recurrence,\u201d he said.",
      "Lee said he would lead a \u201cpragmatic, market-oriented government\u201d and strengthen U.S.-South Korea relations and trilateral cooperation with the U.S. and Japan.",
      "In a departure from his predecessor, Lee also said he would engage in dialogue with rival North Korea while responding strongly to its nuclear and military provocations.",
      "\u201cWe will restore the military\u2019s honor and the public\u2019s trust, which were damaged by illegal martial law, and ensure that the military is never again mobilized for politics,\u201d he said.",
      "The election took place six months to the day after President Yoon Suk Yeol shocked the East Asian democracy of more than 50 million people by abruptly declaring martial law, citing threats from \u201canti-state forces\u201d and accusing the opposition-controlled parliament of paralyzing the government.",
      "Lawmakers pushed past soldiers Yoon had sent to parliament to vote unanimously against the order, which Yoon then withdrew.",
      "Led by Lee, lawmakers impeached Yoon on Dec. 14 over the short-lived order, after which South Korea was led by a series of acting presidents. The leadership vacuum has hampered South Korea in Washington as it is trying to negotiate with the Trump administration over a 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff and other levies.",
      "Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, had been considered the most likely next president since Yoon was impeached. The election was triggered in April when the Constitutional Court upheld his impeachment.",
      "But South Korean voters were animated more by anger at Yoon and his party than by an affinity for Lee.",
      "\u201cHis victory is not thanks to any particular policy proposals, but rather a result of Yoon\u2019s spectacular collapse,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.",
      "The martial law episode has deeply unsettled South Korea, which spent decades under military-authoritarian rule. It has also worsened polarization between liberals and conservatives, with regular rallies held for and against Yoon and a presidential campaign filled with personal attacks.",
      "Some voters directed their anger at Kim, the candidate for Yoon\u2019s former People Power Party, even though Yoon left the party last month to help his campaign.",
      "\u201cI believe that Lee will restore the democratic system and establish a democratic government,\u201d said Lee Jung Sup, a company executive in Seoul. \u201cThen our economy will be revitalized.\u201d",
      "Kim, who was labor minister under Yoon, criticized the martial law declaration but opposed his impeachment. Supporters pointed to Kim\u2019s squeaky-clean record, contrasting it with Lee\u2019s involvement in several criminal trials.",
      "\u201cIt is unfair to reflect the martial law declared by the former president onto Kim,\u201d said Oh Chang-soo, a retired religious leader in his 60s.",
      "Lee\u2019s vows to punish those involved in the martial law order have raised fears of further political turmoil. Yoon is still standing trial on charges of insurrection, a crime that is punishable by death or life in prison.",
      "Lee said this week that besides addressing economic concerns and internal division, his main priority is reaching a trade deal with the United States.",
      "In addition to the 25% tariff \u2014 which is set to take effect July 9 \u2014South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy is vulnerable to sector-specific U.S. levies on some of its most important exports, such as steel and automobiles.",
      "Asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s tendency to pressure his negotiating partners, Lee said, \u201cThat\u2019s a kind of political behavior exhibited by powerful nations, and we must endure it well.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the president of the Republic of Korea\u2019s kowtowing briefly would allow 52 million people to thrive, then he must do so,\u201d he told South Korea\u2019s Christian Broadcasting System on Monday, using the country\u2019s formal name.",
      "While Trump is a formidable figure, Lee said, diplomacy should be mutually beneficial, and \u201cI\u2019m not an easy opponent, either.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a fair number of cards to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things to give and take on both sides.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Los Angeles County on Monday agreed to pay $2.7 million to a teenager who was attacked by at least six other young people at a juvenile detention center in so-called \"gladiator fights\" that were allegedly facilitated by probation officers.",
      "The boy's beating in 2023 at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall was captured on surveillance video that also showed several officials standing idly by and some of them shaking hands with the participants in the beating.",
      "A state grand jury in March charged 30 correctional officers for their role in allowing and sometimes encouraging nearly 70 fights to take place between July and December 2023. The officers face charges including child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery.",
      "More than 140 victims between the ages of 12 and 18 were involved, according to authorities.",
      "Attorney General Rob Bonta said after the charges were announced that it seemed the attacks were planned.",
      "\"They often wanted them to happen at the beginning of the day, in a certain time, in a certain place. A space and a time was created for the fights, and the plan was for the fights to happen,\" he said.",
      "The investigation began after the Los Angeles Times first obtained and published video footage that shows a then-16-year-old being attacked by at least six other young people, who came at him one by one as officers stand by watching.",
      "The video was first made public during a court hearing during which a public defender for the boy, now 17, argued to a judge that he was not safe at Los Padrinos and should be released ahead of his trial.",
      "His attorney, Jamal Tooson, said the settlement was a \"first step\" in recognizing the \"egregious\" conduct of the LA County Probation Department.",
      "\"Our priority needs to be not just protecting my client but all children in similar circumstances under the care and watch of the probation department,\" Tooson said. \"There were lawsuits prior to this. I personally represent several individuals who've been harmed at the same facility after this.\"",
      "According to a correction action plan written by the department, staff failed to review CCTV footage of the facility, delayed taking the teen to the hospital, and waited too long to notify his parents. To address these issues, the department will ensure CCTV monitors are \"staffed routinely\" and conduct random footage audits, and develop a protocol for making sure young people in custody are given medical care and their parents are informed appropriately.",
      "A judge ruled in April that the LA County Probation Department could not continue housing juveniles at Los Padrinos and approved a plan in May to move more than 100 youths out of the facility. California's state board overseeing local correctional facilities has previously ordered Los Padrinos to be shut down.",
      "Tooson believes there is a pervasive \"culture problem\" extending throughout the probation department's facilities that cannot be addressed by the correction action plan. He has filed at least 19 lawsuits in federal court alleging issues from physical violence allowed by officials to sexual assault by staff members in LA County's youth detention centers, he said.",
      "\"Until we actively start changing the mindset and behavior of those who are put into a caretaking responsibility of these youth, I think we're going to find ourselves in the same situation,\" he said."

      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni\u2019s legal squabble over her claims of emotional distress hit a roadblock Tuesday when a federal judge refused to let Lively dismiss them on her preferred terms, instead telling both sides to reach an agreement.",
      "The recent dispute between the \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d co-stars, who have been entangled in a high-profile legal battle for months, arose after Baldoni\u2019s lawyers requested Lively\u2019s medical and mental health records to defend against her claims that he intentionally and negligently inflicted emotional distress while they were on the set of the film.",
      "Lively\u2019s initial complaint in December accused Baldoni of sexual harassment, as well as retaliation, after she raised issues about his on-set behavior \u2014 allegations Baldoni\u2019s lawyers have denied. Since then, the two stars have been embroiled in a tense legal standoff, with each accusing the other of having orchestrated a smear campaign.",
      "Rather than provide medical and mental health records requested by Baldoni's team, Lively offered to drop her emotional distress claims, according to court documents filed Monday. In response, Baldoni\u2019s lawyers Monday disputed her request to dismiss the claims \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d meaning she would be able to refile them later. In a court filing, Baldoni\u2019s team argued that Lively should permanently dismiss her claims if she will not provide the medical records it requested.",
      "In its own court filing hours later, Lively\u2019s team called Baldoni\u2019s motion a \u201cfalse and plainly improper public relations stunt\u201d and asked the court to deny and strike the motion entirely.",
      "On Tuesday morning, U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman of the Southern District of New York denied Lively\u2019s request but wrote that she can file a formal motion asking for dismissal without prejudice. Otherwise, Liman wrote, Lively\u2019s and Baldoni\u2019s teams must agree among themselves whether the dismissal would be with or without prejudice.",
      "He also denied Baldoni\u2019s motion to force Lively to provide her medical records, saying the request is rendered moot now that Lively is withdrawing her emotional distress claims.",
      "Liman\u2019s ruling pressures Lively to dismiss her claims either way, as he wrote that \u201cif the claims are not dismissed, the Court will preclude Lively from offering any evidence of emotional distress.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Lively\u2019s lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb wrote that Lively offered to dismiss those claims \u201cbecause they are no longer necessary, and she will continue to pursue emotional distress damages through other claims in her lawsuit, including sexual harassment and retaliation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn addition, the Baldoni-Wayfarer strategy of filing retaliatory claims has exposed them to expansive damages under California law,\u201d Lively\u2019s lawyers wrote.",
      "(Wayfarer Studios, the production company behind \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d which Baldoni co-founded, is a defendant along with Baldoni.)",
      "\u201cThis is exactly where both parties were before the Baldoni-Wayfarer Parties rushed to file this utterly pointless motion to compel, all searching for yet another press moment,\u201d Lively\u2019s lawyers wrote.",
      "Lawyers for Baldoni did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s filing Monday argued that Lively was trying to avoid providing her medical records while preserving her claims of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.",
      "\u201cMs. Lively cannot have it both ways. If Ms. Lively wants to withdraw her frivolous IED [intentional infliction of emotional distress] Claims, the Wayfarer Parties are entitled to a dismissal with prejudice to ensure they will not be re-filed,\u201d Baldoni\u2019s lawyers said in the filing. \u201cIf Ms. Lively is unwilling to stipulate to the dismissal of her IED Claims with prejudice, then the Wayfarer Parties will continue to defend against them, and she must produce her medical information and documents as set forth herein.\u201d",
      "Baldoni\u2019s lawyers were specifically seeking the names and addresses of her health care providers, their treatment notes and signed privacy forms authorizing the release of her records. They wrote in their filing Monday that because she claimed emotional injuries, Lively has placed her mental condition \u201cat issue\u201d and thus \u201cwaived any doctor-patient privilege.\u201d",
      "Lively\u2019s lawyers countered Baldoni\u2019s motion in their response Monday, arguing that Lively voluntarily agreed to withdraw her emotional distress claims \u201cin good faith\u201d to streamline the case. They added that Baldoni\u2019s team had conceded that that means their request for medical records would become moot.",
      "Lively\u2019s filing also claimed that Baldoni\u2019s lawyers did not raise any objections to her proposed revisions to the joint stipulation for dismissal during a conference call Monday. It alleged that Baldoni\u2019s team instead rushed to file a \u201cclearly pre-written Motion the minute that the teleconference concluded.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlmost immediately thereafter, tabloid media began reporting \u2018exclusively\u2019 on Ms. Lively\u2019s \u2018shock\u2019 move, claiming that she has \u2018sensationally\u2019 dropped her IIED claim, quoting extensively from the Motion,\u201d Lively\u2019s filing said.",

      "Harry Nickerson, who was 16 when, the Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s Office said, he killed Diane Peterson at San Jose's Branham High School in 1978, died by suicide in 1993.",

      "BOULDER, Colo. \u2014 The 88-year-old Holocaust survivor who was burned during an attack by a man armed with a \"makeshift flamethrower\" had a message on Tuesday for the rest of America: \"We are better than this.\"",
      "In her first words spoken publicly since Sunday's gruesome attack on a group of demonstrators advocating for the return of Israeli hostages in Gaza, Barbara Steinmetz told NBC News that what happened \"has nothing to do with the Holocaust, it has to do with a human being that wants to burn other people.\"",
      "Steinmetz said she and other members of the group Run for Their Lives were \"peacefully\" demonstrating when they were suddenly attacked.",
      "During a brief interview, Steinmetz still appeared to be rattled by the ordeal.",
      "\"It's about what the hell is going on in our country,\" Steinmetz said when pressed. \"What the hell is going on?\"",
      "Asked if there was anything more she wanted Americans to know after the attack, Steinmetz said she \"wants people to be nice and decent to each other, kind, respectful, encompassing.\"",
      "\"We\u2019re Americans,\" she said. \"We are better than this. That\u2019s what I want them to know. That they be kind and decent human beings.\"",
      "Steinmetz, who was born in Hungary, was among a dozen people who were injured in the attack allegedly carried out by a 45-year-old Egyptian national named Mohamed Sabry Soliman.",
      "Police said Soliman also hurled Molotov cocktails at the demonstrators.",
      "The attack occurred 11 days after two Israeli Embassy workers were gunned down and killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington.",
      "In both Boulder and Washington, authorities said, the alleged attackers yelled, \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d",
      "Rabbi Marc Soloway, the leader of Congregation Bonai Shalom in Boulder, where Steinmetz is a member, said the woman suffered minor burns but is \"going to be OK\" physically.",
      "Soloway said he was less sure about how someone who escaped the Holocaust could process what happened on Pearl Street.",
      "\"Can you imagine the trauma that that reactivates?\" Soloway said. \"It\u2019s just horrendous.\"",
      "Soloway said Steinmetz was injured while taking part in a weekly walk \"purely to raise awareness of the fact that there are still 58 hostages in tunnels in Gaza.\"",
      "In addition to Steinmetz, five other members of his congregation were injured and two remain hospitalized, Soloway said.",
      "The rabbi said Soliman, who has been charged with attempted murder and a hate crime, among other offenses, is \"deluded and misguided.\"",
      "\"If he thinks that an act of unspeakable brutality and violence is going to help the condition of the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza, he is so deluded and so misguided,\" the rabbi said.",
      "As for Steinmetz, much of her childhood was spent on an island off the coast of Croatia, which was then part of Italy and where her parents operated a hotel, according to the CU Independent, the student newspaper at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which published an article about her in 2019 for Holocaust remembrance week.",
      "\u201cI lived an idyllic childhood on the banks of the Adriatic,\u201d Steinmetz recalled in the article.",
      "But after Italian dictator Benito Mussolini stripped the Italian Jews of their citizenship in 1938, Steinmetz's father took the family to Hungary and from there they fled to France two years later.",
      "When the Germans entered France, Steinmetz and her family were forced to flee again, this time to Portugal, where thousands of other refugees were looking for a way to escape from Europe.",
      "Steinmetz said her father applied for asylum to a dozen countries, including the United States. But only one would take them \u2014 the Dominican Republic.",
      "They departed for the DR on a Portuguese cargo ship in 1941 and during a brief stop in New York City she got to see the city's famous skyline, she told the Independent.",
      "Steinmetz said they were resettled in the coastal town of Sos\u00faa, and while her parents toiled at menial jobs, she and her sister were sent to a Catholic boarding school where only the Mother Superior knew that they were Jews.",
      "\u201cFor four years, the convent was our home,\u201d Steinmetz recalled in the article. \u201cAlthough formidable, the sisters were kind.\u201d",
      "Once the war was over, the Steinmetz family was able to move to the United States, where her parents went back into the hotel business in New Hampshire.",
      "Steinmetz moved to Boulder in \"the mid-2000s,\" according to the article."

The decision came after growing opposition on the right to Ono's past statements about diversity, equity and inclusion, Covid and transgender rights, among other issues.",
      "Under Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has prided itself on being at the vanguard of the national conservative movement. But the rejection of Ono, the former president of the University of Michigan, put DeSantis in a thorny political position, and it was a notable outcome in a state Republican ecosystem generally defined by donors and influential figures\u2019 getting their way.",
      "One of DeSantis\u2019 longtime biggest political supporters \u2014 Mori Hosseini, the billionaire chair of the University of Florida Board of Trustees \u2014 strongly backed Ono\u2019s bid to become president of the state\u2019s flagship university.",
      "On the other hand, national conservatives, including Christopher Rufo, an activist who built his reputation fighting racial sensitivity trainings and critical race theory courses; Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a Trump ally running for governor; and Donald Trump Jr. argued that Ono\u2019s past support for DEI policies made him unqualified for the job.",
      "\u201cWTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!???\u201d Trump Jr. wrote on X last month. \u201cThis woke psycho might be a perfect fit for a Communist school in California, but how is he even being considered for this role in Florida?",
      "\u201cEvery single member of the Florida Board of Governors should vote against him!!!\u201d he continued.",
      "Two Trump advisers familiar with the issue said his post did not speak for the White House, which was not officially engaged in the fight.",
      "Trump Jr.\u2019s post amplified one from Rufo, whom DeSantis has praised and whom he appointed to a separate university board in the state in 2023. Rufo's message blasted Ono for a video in which he promoted \"equity and inclusion ... embedded in all areas of academic work\u201d when he was president and vice chancellor at the University of British Columbia in Canada.",
      "Ono\u2019s record on DEI policies, the handling of the Covid pandemic and issues like environmental justice were heavily scrutinized Tuesday at the meeting of the Florida Board of Governors, the state\u2019s top education board, which needed to vote to ratify Ono\u2019s new contract.",
      "Ono said repeatedly that he had \u201cevolved\u201d on those issues at a hearing that lasted nearly four hours. But the board ultimately rejected him in a 10-6 vote, with notable \u201cno\u201d votes from DeSantis allies, including former state House Speakers Jose Oliva and Paul Renner, along with the outgoing leader of the state Education Department, Manny Diaz, whom DeSantis recently appointed to lead the University of West Florida.",
      "\u201cThere is no way those guys vote against him without getting some signal from the governor,\u201d a longtime DeSantis adviser said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone expected this, but if you look at the votes, I think that tells you where the governor is at.\u201d",
      "Four Florida Republicans told NBC News that their understanding was that DeSantis was initially behind Ono but that the national conservative backlash forced him to not fully put his support behind him publicly or make direct calls to the Board of Governors.",
      "But behind the scenes, his team was quietly discussing how to give him a push, according to two people familiar with the matter. One of them said DeSantis' chief of staff, Jason Weida, was making calls in support of Ono ahead of the vote.",
      "Underscoring the politically sensitive nature of the vote, DeSantis\u2019 political operation tried to claim some victory after it.",
      "\u201cSanta Ono is OUT,\u201d posted Jordan Schachtel, a newly hired DeSantis political staffer. \u201cThe Florida Board of Governors has voted to Reject Ono as President of the University of Florida.\u201d",
      "\u201cFlorida has voted to reject wokeness, DEI, CRT, at our flagship university,\u201d he continued.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also praised the vote, saying it was the \"right decision.\"",
      "Donalds, who has Trump's backing in his 2026 bid for governor, was an Ono skeptic from the start. Notably, DeSantis\u2019 wife, Casey, is also considering a run for governor, and the two prominent Florida Republicans are seen as being on a political collision course if Casey DeSantis ultimately decides to run.",
      "\u201cI give credit to the Florida Board of Governors for standing up for Florida\u2019s conservative values,\u201d Donalds told NBC News. \u201cWoke has no place in our university system. It\u2019s time to restart the presidential search at UF.\u201d",
      "Other longtime Florida operatives said Donalds and other conservative groups amplifying the fight to the Republican political base nationally helped keep DeSantis out of the conversation in a more public way.",
      "\u201cThe governor was obviously all in,\u201d a DeSantis ally said. \u201cThen Byron Donalds and [the conservative group] Turning Point came out against. The governor in the end does the one thing he knows how to do: run away and protect himself.\u201d",
      "DeSantis\u2019 office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "During the contentious meeting, Ono tried to explain that he has had an \u201cevolution\u201d of thought on issues like DEI and that he was both aligned with and attracted to Florida\u2019s brand of governance, which has cracked down on both.",
      "\u201cThose sorts of programs will not have a place at the University of Florida,\u201d he told the board.",

      "MIAMI \u2014 Two South Florida shark divers convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman\u2019s longline several miles from shore have been pardoned by President Donald Trump.",
      "Pardons for Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. were signed last Wednesday. They had been convicted in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction.",
      "The two men avoided prison time, but they were ordered to pay $3,343.72 in restitution, and the felony convictions prevented them from voting in Florida, owning firearms and traveling freely outside the United States.",
      "\u201cWe never stopped fighting, and justice has finally prevailed,\u201d Moore\u2019s attorney, Marc Seitles, said in a statement. \u201cWe are thrilled the White House considered our arguments and determined this was an unjust prosecution. We could not be happier for John and Tanner.\u201d",
      "Moore, who was captain of a shark-diving charter boat, and Mansell, a crew member, spotted the longline about 3 miles off Jupiter Inlet in August 2020, according to court records. Believing it was an illegal fishing line, the men freed the sharks and the grouper, reported it to state wildlife officials and brought the line back to shore.",
      "Federal prosecutors charged the men with theft. Officials said the line actually belonged to a fisherman licensed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to catch sharks for research.",
      "A jury convicted Mansell and Moore, and their appeals were denied. The full and unconditional pardons Trump signed erase those convictions.",
      "\u201cThis case never should have been filed,\u201d Mansell\u2019s attorney, Ian Goldstein, said in a statement. \u201cThese gentlemen made an honest mistake and were trying to save sharks from what they believed to be an illegal longline fishing setup. I can\u2019t think of two individuals more deserving of a Presidential Pardon.\u201d",
      "The pardon is especially notable because Trump has a well-documented history of disliking sharks. At a campaign rally last year, he mused that Lake Michigan was preferable to the Pacific or Atlantic oceans because \"you don\u2019t have sharks. That\u2019s a big advantage. I\u2019ll take the one without the sharks.\u201d",
      "His animosity goes back over a decade. In 2013, he posted on X (then Twitter), \"Sharks are last on my list \u2014 other than perhaps the losers and haters of the World!\""

      "Employers increased job openings more than expected in April while hiring and layoffs also both rose, according to a report Tuesday that showed a relatively steady labor market.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed available jobs totaled nearly 7.4 million, an increase of 191,000 from March and higher than the 7.1 million consensus forecast by economists surveyed by FactSet. On an annual basis, the level was off 228,000, or about 3%.",
      "The ratio of available jobs to unemployed workers was down to 1.03 to 1 for the month, close to the March level.",
      "Hiring also increased for the month, rising by 169,000 to 5.6 million, while layoffs rose by 196,000 to 1.79 million.",
      "Quits, an indicator of worker confidence in their ability to find another job, edged lower, falling by 150,000 to 3.2 million.",
      "\u201cThe labor market is returning to more normal levels despite the uncertainty within the macro outlook,\u201d wrote Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Research. \u201cUnderlying patterns in hirings and firings suggest the labor market is holding steady.\u201d",
      "The report comes just a few days ahead of the BLS nonfarm payrolls count for May.",
      "With other signs, particularly sentiment data, showing that hiring is softening, economists expect job growth of 125,000, down from the 177,000 in April but still indicative of a solid labor market. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%.",
      "In other economic news Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured goods fell more than expected in April. Orders fell 3.7% on the month, more than the 3.3% Dow Jones forecast and indicative of declining demand after swelling 3.4% in March as businesses sought to get ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Shipment also fell, down 0.3%, while unfilled orders were relatively flat and inventories edged down 0.1%.",
      "Federal Reserve officials are watching the various data points carefully for clues as to how various factors are affecting the broader economic picture. There is some fear that the tariffs will raise inflation and slow hiring, though that hasn\u2019t showed up yet in the hard data. Sentiment surveys, by contrast, show heightened fears over both.",
      "\u201cFor many sectors, I\u2019m not hearing that the labor markets are changing in material ways,\u201d Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in a scrum with reporters Tuesday. \u201cAt the macro level, I haven\u2019t gotten sort of a strong overarching picture or impression that things are moving in a significant way, and we\u2019ll just have to see if that stays or whether something changes.\u201d",
      "Traders largely expect the Fed to keep its benchmark borrowing rate steady in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December 2024. The market thinks the Fed won\u2019t cut again until September, and Bostic said he only would favor one reduction this year.",

      "Final results from a long-running U.S.-based experiment announced Tuesday show a tiny particle continues to act strangely \u2014 but that\u2019s still good news for the laws of physics as we know them.",
      "\u201cThis experiment is a huge feat in precision,\u201d said Tova Holmes, an experimental physicist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville who is not part of the collaboration.",
      "The mysterious particles called muons are considered heavier cousins to electrons. They wobble like a top when inside a magnetic field, and scientists are studying that motion to see if it lines up with the foundational rulebook of physics called the Standard Model.",
      "Experiments in the 1960s and 1970s seemed to indicate all was well. But tests at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the late 1990s and early 2000s produced something unexpected: the muons weren\u2019t behaving like they should.",
      "Decades later, an international collaboration of scientists decided to rerun the experiments with an even higher degree of precision. The team raced muons around a magnetic, ring-shaped track \u2014 the same one used in Brookhaven\u2019s experiment \u2014 and studied their signature wiggle at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago.",
      "The first two sets of results \u2014 unveiled in 2021 and 2023 \u2014 seemed to confirm the muons\u2019 weird behavior, prompting theoretical physicists to try to reconcile the new measurements with the Standard Model.",
      "Now, the group has completed the experiment and released a measurement of the muon\u2019s wobble that agrees with what they found before, using more than double the amount of data compared to 2023. They submitted their results to the journal Physical Review Letters.",
      "That said, it\u2019s not yet closing time for our most basic understanding of what\u2019s holding the universe together. While the muons raced around their track, other scientists found a way to more closely reconcile their behavior with the Standard Model with the help of supercomputers.",
      "There\u2019s still more work to be done as researchers continue to put their heads together and future experiments take a stab at measuring the muon wobble \u2014 including one at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex that\u2019s expected to start near the end of the decade. Scientists also are still analyzing the final muon data to see if they can glean information about other mysterious entities like dark matter.",
      "\u201cThis measurement will remain a benchmark ... for many years to come,\u201d said Marco Incagli with the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Italy.",
      "By wrangling muons, scientists are striving to answer fundamental questions that have long puzzled humanity, said Peter Winter with Argonne National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cAren\u2019t we all curious to understand how the universe works?\u201d said Winter."

      "The key dynamics shaping a busy month of primaries",
      "The next three weeks will bring primaries in the three most closely watched races of 2025. Here are the key dynamics to watch:",
      "New Jersey: Both parties will nominate gubernatorial candidates in the Garden State on June 10. Barring a complete shock, this will serve as a coronation for Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who was already leading by wide margins in the polls when President Donald Trump endorsed him several weeks ago.",
      "The Democratic contest isn\u2019t as clear-cut, but there is a favorite: Rep. Mikie Sherrill has separated herself from the six-candidate field in the most recent polling and enjoys strong backing from the state\u2019s still-powerful (though probably not as much as before) county political machines. The combination of Trump\u2019s surprising strength in New Jersey last year and Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s unexpectedly close re-election in 2021 has Democratic leaders apprehensive about their November prospects. Many concluded that Sherrill, a Navy veteran who flipped a GOP-held district to win her House seat in 2018, would be their most electable option.",
      "Worth keeping an eye on, though, is a pair of mayors. Jersey City\u2019s Steve Fulop is portraying his candidacy as a war against political bossism and has aligned with local anti-establishment candidates. And Newark\u2019s Ras Baraka will try to couple support from Black voters (over 20% of the primary electorate) with appeal to the party\u2019s broader progressive base, especially after his high-profile arrest at an ICE detention facility. But both have lagged in polling and their overlapping appeal to progressives only complicates each other\u2019s path.",
      "Once the matchup is set, the general election will feature a clash of two long-term trends. On the one hand, New Jersey has only elected a governor from the party that controls the White House once in the last nine races \u2014 an ominous harbinger for the GOP. But it also hasn\u2019t handed the same party power in Trenton for three straight elections since 1961 \u2014 a feat Democrats are trying to pull off this year. Something will have to give.",
      "Virginia: On June 17, Virginia Democrats and Republicans will officially set their slates for the fall. Both gubernatorial nominations are already settled: Lt. Gov. Winsome Earl-Sears for the Republicans and Rep. Abigail Spanberger for the Democrats.",
      "And the general election picture already looks clearer in Virginia than in New Jersey. Polling has consistently shown Spanberger \u2014 who, like Sherrill, flipped a Republican seat en route to Congress in 2018 \u2014 ahead of Earl-Sears. And in 11 of the last 12 gubernatorial races, Virginians have sided against whichever party controlled the White House at the time.",
      "New York City: And then there\u2019s the mayoral primary in the Big Apple on June 24, the city\u2019s first with a ranked-choice voting system.",
      "Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo is the front-runner on the Democratic side, but the two most recent polls show Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani emerging from the crowded field as his main competition. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has tapped into support from voters who tend to be younger, college-educated and progressive. He also runs significantly better with white voters than nonwhite voters.",
      "While certainly large, Mamdani\u2019s coalition is not broad enough demographically to win the primary \u2014 at least not yet. But his rapid rise presents some interesting potential scenarios. If Mamdani ends up toppling Cuomo, the former governor could still run in the general election anyway, on the ballot line of a party he just created. It\u2019s a move that his father, Mario Cuomo, tried back in 1977, after he fell short in the Democratic mayoral primary.",
      "There\u2019s also the leftist Working Families Party, which also has its own general election ballot line. Its leaders have indicated they have no plans to let Cuomo have that line even if he wins the Democratic primary. More recently, the party formally recommended that voters rank Mamdani as their top choice in the Democratic primary. If Mamdani misses narrowly in the Democratic primary, could he still run this fall as the WFP\u2019s candidate? Would someone else?",
      "On top of all of this, New York City Mayor Eric Adams is still officially running. He\u2019s bypassing the Democratic primary but has ballot lines of his own for the general election. Few think Adams can actually win in November, but his potential to grab a sizable chunk of votes could make a third-party bid more enticing for another candidate.",
      "'More is more': Hakeem Jeffries pushes Democrats to flood the zone in opposition to Trump",
      "In the chaotic opening weeks of President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration, Democrats debated whether to push back on every norm-shattering executive action, or pick and choose their spots and hope Trump would prove to be his own worst enemy.",
      "That debate has been settled, with Democrats aggressively taking on Trump in the courts, in the streets and on social media.",
      "At the center of that messaging strategy is House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who privately has been urging his members to be more visible in their districts and on digital media, and has stepped up his own activity in recent weeks.",
      "Rather than his regular, once-a-week news conference in the Capitol, Jeffries now holds as many as three press briefings with reporters each week in Washington. He is also making weekly appearances on popular podcasts outside the traditional political media circuit, including those hosted by Stephen A. Smith, Tony Kornheiser, Jon Stewart, Katie Couric and Scott Galloway.",
      "\u201cWe are in a \u2018more is more\u2019 environment. These aren\u2019t ordinary times, and they require an extraordinary response,\u201d Jeffries said in a phone interview with NBC News on Tuesday, one of roughly two dozen digital media interviews he has participated in since February.",
      "After suffering a bruising defeat in the last presidential election and still years out from the next one, Democrats are without a clear national leader. And the party\u2019s base has displayed a hunger for a new and younger generation of voices to take charge.",
      "That has opened the door for Jeffries, 54, to assume an even bigger role in the party, even as he is still coming into national prominence and \u2014 less than three years removed from succeeding Nancy Pelosi as House Democrats\u2019 leader \u2014 not yet a household name.",
      "The flood-the-zone strategy is a marked change for a politician with a reputation for being cautious and calculated. But if that game plan pays off and Democrats manage to win control of the House in next year\u2019s midterm elections, Jeffries would be the favorite to become speaker \u2014 and the party\u2019s most powerful member in Washington.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s meeting the moment,\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., an influential progressive in the party, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I say he\u2019s, right now, the leader of the Democratic Party.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "When Prince Royce released his first hit song, \u201cStand By Me,\u201d in 2010, the singer wasn\u2019t very excited about the moment.",
      "\u201cI was actually bummed out when I recorded 'Stand By Me' because originally I had released a song called \u2018Coraz\u00f3n Sin Cara\u2019 that was this song about inner beauty. It was this beautiful song that I had written and I thought was definitely a hit,\u201d Royce, 36, tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd I put that song out, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "His record label suggested three songs to cover, including Ben E. King\u2019s \u201cStand By Me.\u201d He reluctantly recorded the song but with a Spanglish bachata twist and without any expectations.",
      "The song became a hit, peaking at No. 8 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart.",
      "The success of \u201cStand By Me,\u201d Royce says, really opened up a \u201clot of doors for me, and I realized what the power of a cover could do.\u201d",
      "Now, 15 years later, Royce is having a full-circle moment with his latest album, \u201cEterno,\u201d which translates to \"Eternal\" and is a 13-track record of cover songs.",
      "The singer brings his signature sultry bachata sound with the arrangements of classic hits from the Backstreet Boys, Bee Gees, the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Wonder and more \u2014 and yes, they include that Spanglish twist.",
      "\u201cBeing able to bring certain people that remember the song back into their time, and reintroducing the song to a different generation,\u201d he says, \u201cI think that that\u2019s what the concept of this album was, bringing that nostalgia back from the eras of the \u201870s, \u201880s, \u201890s, and reintroducing it to Latin America and to today.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year during Premio Lo Nuestro, Royce teased his album, out now, with a performance medley of the Temptations\u2019 \u201cMy Girl,\u201d \u201cHow Deep Is Your Love\u201d by Bee Gees and King Harvest\u2019s \u201cDancing in the Moonlight.\u201d",
      "Most recently, Royce and Richard Marx came together to sing the Spanglish version of \u201cRight Here Waiting,\u201d which is included in \u201cEterno.\u201d The moment was captured on Instagram and shows the two artists switching in Spanish and English as they sing a verse and the chorus.",
      "\u201cI love that you\u2019re going to turn a whole other generation on to this song,\u201d Marx says in the video.",
      "\"I'm 100% Latino, Dominican, and also 100% American,\" Royce tells TODAY.com, adding, \u201cThis is so much more than just a covers album. It\u2019s bringing all these cultures together.\u201d",
      "Below, Royce shares his insight into the creation of \u201cEterno,\u201d touring and the growth of bachata in recent decades.",
      "This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.",
      "What are some of the biggest challenges when selecting the covers for the album?",
      "For me, it was getting educated on, getting very in depth with each song. Who wrote it, what genre was it, when did it come out? What did they do? I like respecting the record.",
      "For the translations, I really wanted to be the closest to the original song, as far as the meaning of what they were trying to say \u2014 and then try to bring in my essence to it. You know, keep some things that I thought were key moments, but bring things that I felt could be different in my style or change it up. That's kind of how I went about each song.",
      "You wrote all the new renditions. Talk to me about the process of putting your personal spin on the songs.",
      "I think it was actually more difficult than doing my own albums because when I'm recording my own song, if I don't like something, I'll just change it. If I don't like a chord, if I don't like a melody, if I don't like a change that they presented to me, I would just change it and then that's it.",
      "Here, I was more forced to stay in the box of what the original song was, because I didn't want to change it too much. I didn't want to be, like, crazy change and people be like, \"Whoa, that wasn't what the song was.\" That'd be maybe an interpolation instead of a cover. That was really more the challenge, which, I like the challenge. I think the challenge was fun to do things with my voice that I normally wouldn't do.",
      "The Backstreet Boys cover of \"I Want It That Way\" is a fun one and more modern. Tell me why you chose that song.",
      "Everything was from back in the day and I said, \"I don't know if this album is about just songs from the '70s or just the '80s. What about something from the '90s?\" It was actually my producer who was like, \"Yo, what about Backstreet?\" And I thought, is that song old enough or is that too recent? But then I Googled it and it's 25 years old.",
      "I think it\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s (old) enough to say it\u2019s a classic. And I think that\u2019s been one of the favorites, for real. I feel like a lot of people genuinely have been drawn to that song, and I\u2019m happy I included it because I was reluctant, thinking, \u201cMan, is it too recent in comparison to the other songs?\u201d",
      "Were there any songs that you wanted to cover but weren't able to?",
      "One of the songs was \u201cHuman Nature\u201d by Michael Jackson. I had recorded it and I wasn\u2019t sure if it perfectly fit in there. I decided to just leave it out because I was unsure if it flowed. I keep thinking, \u201cWell, maybe I should have tried something else or tried harder.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s so many artists that were left out. I mean, there\u2019s just thousands of songs. There\u2019s so many ways you can go.",
      "You're planning on going on tour. What can fans expect and what will the songs from this album look like onstage?",
      "There's no tour dates yet, but there should be a tour hopefully by the end of the year.",
      "With every tour and every album, I always bring in hits from all the albums. I am going a little more theatrical with this album. I have 13 music videos and they all kind of connect. It goes a different way than the traditional music video, so I may go a little bit that route for the tour.",
      "In your opinion, what is the state of bachata at the moment and how has it evolved since you released \"Stand By Me\"?",
      "I think it\u2019s always been good. In music and in fashion, anything, there\u2019s always ups and downs. There\u2019s always new trends, new sounds and new artists emerging in the art world, in acting and everything. As for me, as a bachata singer, and not just a singer of the genre but as a person who\u2019s representing it as well, I feel like it\u2019s almost my responsibility to still put that on people\u2019s faces, help (the genre) grow and do collaborations.",
      "In comparison to when I first started, a couple years ago now, I\u2019ve seen it grow to a point where Colombian artists like Manuel Turizo are recording bachata. Shakira, she recorded her first bachata with me, she did another one with Ozuna. Rosal\u00eda sang bachata with The Weeknd. So many artists that aren\u2019t just Dominican \u2014 because at first it was only maybe, like, Dominicans recording bachata. So I think it\u2019s definitely grown into another space where people have been experimenting with it a little more in other countries.",
      "Looking back on the last 15 years, what would you say is the biggest lesson you've learned, professionally or personally?",
      "I\u2019ve learned to have perseverance, to just keep going, to keep swimming. I\u2019ve run two marathons, I\u2019m running a third one, actually, this year. I\u2019ve kind of applied that to life \u2014 like, you got to just keep going. You got to go through the rain, through the fire, through the wind and just keep going. I think that\u2019s how music is. You got to just keep going and keep re-creating and believe in yourself and creating new ideas."

      "At the end of their conversation, Fallon told Johnson that her dad, Don Johnson, gifted him a cardigan sweater, which he subsequently pulled out from behind the desk.",
      "When Fallon suggested Johnson \u201cborrow\u201d the sweater, she gave him a hard time, saying he probably just didn\u2019t like the cardigan for himself.",

      "In a June 1 video updating her followers on her journey, Thurston said she just finished her second month of treatment. She also noted that her cancer treatment lasts \u201ctechnically forever.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter finishing two months of my medication, my hair is coming out in an unnatural amount of clumps \u2014 working on that,\u201d she said, pointing to the camera. \u201cI\u2019m losing my memory. That\u2019s great.\u201d",
      "Thurston recalled a recent event going through customs, likely referring to her return from a trip to Italy with husband Jeff Arcuri. She explained she was was asked where she was coming from and she couldn't remember.",
      "\u201cBut yeah cancer is s-----,\u201d Thurston continued. \u201cSometimes, I\u2019m like, \u2018Stop feeling bad for yourself.\u2019 Then other times, I\u2019m like, \u2018No, you\u2019re allowed to feel bad for yourself. Cancer f------ sucks.\u2019\u201d",
      "In March, Thurston revealed in an Instagram video that her cancer spread to her liver. Now, she explained that she has to make \u201cbig decisions on how to treat my liver.\u201d",
      "She had been considering radiation, ablation and histotripsy, which she said she ultimately chose to undergo with NYU Langone Health.",
      "Histotripsy is a radiology procedure that uses ultrasound waves to treat liver tumors, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.",

      "\u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d alum revealed her breast cancer diagnosis in an emotional Instagram post Feb. 15. Having \u201cno family history\u201d of breast cancer, she subsequently shared on March 18 in another Instagram video that she discovered a \u201cpainful\u201d small lump, which she described as a \u201crubbery, marble\u201d in her breast.

      "A cancer identified as triple positive involves cancerous cells that grow using three different types of receptors, according to the the MD Anderson Cancer Center. This is a subtype of HER2 positive breast cancer, which is considered to be the most treatable type of breast cancer.",
      "\u201cI know Stage 4 can sound very scary, and it can be. However, given that I am triple positive, and the spots on my liver are fairly small and detected early, I feel very optimistic on my outcome,\u201d she said in the video, adding that she planned to start chemotherapy treatment.",
      "Thurston has also been open about her fertility journey amid cancer treatment, noting that she's freezing her eggs so she and Arcuri can try to have a child.",
      "\u201cNow that I have #stage4breastcancer , pregnancy would be a risk for me, especially as someone with HR+ breast cancer (feeds off hormones),\u201d she captioned a May 24 Instagram video on their IVF journey. \u201cSo in the future, we will peruse #surrogacy in hopes of starting our family.\u201d"

      "\u201cSomeone said, \u2018You\u2019ll never get work if you don\u2019t have a nose job.\u2019 I said no. I didn\u2019t want to be a pretty actress anyway. I elected to be not so pretty,\u201d she added.",

      "Bates, who's made headlines for both her starring role in CBS's \"Matlock\" reboot and her 100-pound weight loss, shot back, \"Oh, get out of town! I feel more beautiful than I have in my entire life.\"",
      "But Mirren insisted. \"We\u2019re not. None of us are beauties. We all have really different faces, very interesting faces,\" she said.",
      "Russell, 49, asked Mirren if she meant none of them were \"model beautiful.\"",
      "\"We all know what 'beautiful' is like,\" Mirren replied.",
      "Russell then made everyone the table laugh by quipping, \"Kathy\u2019s like, 'Speak for yourself.'\""

      "After previously coming out as a member of the LGBTQ+ community in 2021, Siwa said on \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d that she prefers to describe herself as \u201cqueer\u201d rather than \u201clesbian.\u201d",

      "\"Listen, I can tell you with great certainty that every woman that was with me on that stage did not look that way two hours prior,\" Frankel said. \"OK, it was everybody's job, and that's what goes on in Hollywood, in the entertainment industry, and the images that you and your daughters see of women, of Kim Kardashian, of Beyonc\u00e9, of J.Lo, of every famous person, that there is a lot of work that goes into that, a lot of glam, a lot of contouring, a lot of lighting, a lot.\"",
      "Frankel added that she does not normally wear makeup, and that she doesn't crash diet.",
      "\"I don't go to a gym. I don't have a workout. I walk on the beach. Everything I do has balance. I self-regulate so I have a good relationship with food and exercise,\" she said. \"It wasn't always that way. This is not that I have a good metabolism or just good genes, because I used to be 25 pounds heavier in my early 30s.\"",
      "Frankel said she doesn't have issues with \"food noise\" or \"exercise noise\" at this point in her life.",
      "\"The reason my body is natural is because the exercise that I do, and have always done for my body is natural. I'll go months without exercise, and definitely days without doing anything, but I always come back to it,\" she said. \"I have a good relationship with it, and I have a good relationship with food because it's the obsession, it's the extremes, it's the binging, it's the emotions, it's the noise. That is why we are struggling.\"",

      "\"What I didn't know is what the culture is like there. And I didn't know who 90% of the women were. I will tell you that the resounding theme and culture is women supporting women,\" she continued.",
      "Frankel said the women at the event were not just giving compliments, but asking about what people were planning to do during their walks and helping them with their ideas.",
      "\"I have to say that as much as the runway show was really fun ... I wasn't nervous. I was aware of my age. I was aware that I'm not a model, and there were a lot of models, and I was just like, 'Am I gonna stick this landing or make an absolute fool myself and embarrass you guys?'\" she said.",
      "In the caption of another Instagram post, she summarized the event: \"This runway show was such an amazing experience and I am forever grateful to my community here in Florida and the people for your endless support.\""

      "The book club started as a dare to prove that people still read \u2014 the festival, which unfolded over May 30 and 31 and was sponsored by Nashville Music City, is proof that she was right.",
      "Since Read With Jenna launched in 2019, Jenna has chosen 80 books and counting, with a focus on championing debut and diverse voices. Fifty books became bestsellers. And 15 of the club\u2019s authors are in the room at the Read With Jenna Book Festival.",
      "The first ever live gathering of Jenna\u2019s book community and authors is the culmination of years of work. But it\u2019s also the product of a lifetime.",
      "Jenna, onstage, talks about the two grandmothers and mother whose love of reading molded her into the woman, and literary tastemaker, she is. She says Jenna Welch, her namesake, read to explore beyond her life in central Texas. Her grandmother Barbara Bush read for connection and enjoyed reading her granddaughters\u2019 selections. Her mother, Laura Bush, a librarian, read for purpose.",
      "You could say Jenna reads for all those reasons \u2014 plus, perhaps, change-making. In addition to bringing people together around her monthly picks, Jenna is starting her own imprint and having a hand in shaping books that go out into the world. (The first book, \u201cConform,\u201d is out later this year.)",
      "At the Read With Jenna Book Festival, audience members experienced the magic of books. While reading is a solitary act, Jenna believes a shared love of books, and the conversation they inspire, can bring people together.",
      "On the morning of May 31, the room was full of about 200 readers from more than 35 states around the country \u2014 cities including Atlanta, Charleston, Chicago, Huntsville, Alabama and of course, Nashville.",
      "Many attendees were friends, like an Elin Hilderbrand-loving duo who met in high school and Amy Sixbey and Cindy Hedges, who met at a yarn store they later co-owned. (Hedges and Sixbey, who are in multiple book clubs each, give advice for running one: Meet once a month and \"read the book.\")",
      "Another woman gave an instant \u201cyes\u201d the moment her sister sent the event\u2019s registration link.",
      "Multiple sets of mothers and daughters at the festival said reading keeps them together even as their lives diverge. \"We communicate through the books we read,\" Patti Grote of Chicago said, next to her grown daughter. \"Bad on Paper\" cohost and novelist Olivia Muenter got her mom tickets for Mother's Day.",
      "Many came by themselves, like one woman who wore Read With Jenna merch she hand-bedazzled for the event \u2014 a jean jacket for the VIP event on Friday and another T-shirt for Saturday\u2019s mainstage. When a 20-year-old couldn't find a friend to join her, she drove by herself.",
      "The day began around 8 a.m. with breakfast and mingling. On the sunny terraces of the W Nashville overlooking Nashville's Gulch district, longtime friends sat side-by-side with solo travelers.",
      "Before events started, and throughout the day, attendees stopped by the many vendors, picking charms to feature on bracelets from local store Charm Bar (cowboy hats and books were popular options), decorating book-shaped cookies from Butterfly Bakehouse, creating a bouquet from Amelia's Flowers, assembling bags of children's books for local libraries and getting their tarot cards read by Sarah Jane Chapman. They also perused pop-ups \u2014 Parnassus Books, the record store Groove and Shop TODAY.",
      "The itinerary was stacked enough to impress a preteen. When Jenna called her eldest daughter Mila to describe the day, Mila responded, \u201cJenna, are you trying to make me jealous?\u201d",
      "Following breakfast came what could only be called a literary marathon. Stepping through the secret door in the bookcase were two bestselling authors, whose chats with Jenna will eventually feature on the Open Book with Jenna podcast.",
      "First, Jenna spoke to \u201cTom Lake\u201d author Ann Patchett about the nun who taught her to read, running a bookstore in Nashville and why she doesn\u2019t have a cell phone.",
      "Jenna also marveled at the full circle moment their conversation represented: At 18, Jenna and her twin Barbara Bush said Donna Tartt and Patchett were their favorite authors \u2014 and now, she was sitting on stage with Patchett. (Patchett said she and Tartt were chuffed by the Bush twins' answer at the time).",
      "From the back of the room, the next speaker, Elin Hilderbrand looked on wearing a white dress that contrasted with her perpetual Nantucket tan. Hilderbrand took the stage after Patchett to discuss whether she\u2019s really retiring, writing with her daughter and how, after 25 years, she\u2019s ushering in a new era: Adaptations.",
      "She and Jenna also shared some news: They are collaborating on a screen project \u2014 but, as Jenna said, \"We can't share much.\" Hilderbrand's fans (\u201cHilderbabes,\" as they're called), will be delighted but not surprised to know that throughout the day of the festival, the best-selling author took breaks out by the pool.",
      "From there, attendees shuffled between the day\u2019s activities. There were interactive book club sessions with Read With Jenna authors Amity Gaige (\u201cHeartwood\u201d), Emma Straub (\u201cAll Adults Here\u201d) and Christina Henriquez (\u201cThe Great Divide\u201d), asking questions about the novels and answering questions about how they were personally moved.",
      "Later came a chance to tap into their creative sides in workshops led by novelist Jessica Soffer (\u201cThis Is a Love Story\u201d) and songwriter Eric Paslay.",
      "After lunch, comedian Tiffany Haddish took the mainstage with Jenna. Haddish got deep, fast, about how her past trauma informs her comedy, and her revelations about her childhood in the foster care system inspired an attendee to share her own story.",
      "One undeniable highlight came when Haddish \u201ccursed\u201d the audience with joy \u2014 \u201cI curse you with all the joy and abundance and success you can handle. You deserve to be happy.\u201d Another unplanned moment came when she and Paslay collaborated on a moving song about her.",
      "The day rounded out with a celebration of what makes Read With Jenna so special: Its authors (who Jenna calls rock stars).",
      "Jenna moderated a panel with multiple Read With Jenna authors (Coco Mellors, Rumaan Alam, Jean Kwok, Alison Espach, and Chris Whitaker, plus a cameo from Mellors\u2019 son, Indigo). Then, lines formed for signings with all the authors in attendance, a list that included Cara Wall, Diane Marie Brown and Tara Stringfellow, too.",
      "Almost 11 hours after the Read With Jenna Book Festival started at 8 a.m., the crowd gathered to listen to singer Blessing Offor perform. (Holly Williams performed with her husband during the VIP event \u2014 it's Music City, after all).",
      "Jenna, overcome yet again, thanked attendees \u2014 and made, if not a firm promise, then the hope of one.",
      "\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll make this an annual pilgrimage. Until then I hope you connect with us,\" she said."

      "\u201cAnd in that moment, something finally clicked,\u201d the TikToker wrote. \u201cSince I started sharing my life online 5 years ago, I\u2019ve constantly tried to figure out which box I belong in based on solely what others want me to be in and that has only been based on my appearance. But last night, I simply just stood for every girl or woman who\u2019s felt lost about where she belongs, but still chooses to show up and put herself out there no matter what.\u201d",

I could not stop projectile vomiting, and I couldn\u2019t drink water. They won\u2019t let you leave if you can\u2019t drink water. I actually can\u2019t explain how horrible it was.\u201d",

      "The strikes have highlighted the increasing importance of drones for both Russia and Ukraine in the war, which entered its fourth year in February.

      "More than two dozen people were killed early Tuesday after the Israeli military opened fire close to an aid distribution point in southern Gaza, local health officials said, the third time in three days that Palestinians were killed in the area.",
      "Video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed dead and injured being rushed to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. At one point, medical workers gathered around a young child whose head was wrapped in bandages.",
      "Dr. Ahmed Abu Sweid, an Australian emergency physician, told NBC News that patients' injuries included \"multiple gunshot wounds, thoracic injuries to the chest, mangled limbs.\"",
      "\u201cThis is the third such event in the last few days,\u201d he said, describing what he called \u201canother mass casualty event from a food aid center\u201d in Rafah.",
      "\u201cThe hospital\u2019s overwhelmed,\u201d Abu Sweid said.",
      "A 5-year-old girl was among the wounded, he added, before abruptly ending the interview to treat a patient being rushed into the room.",
      "At least 27 people were killed Tuesday and more than 160 injured as they waited for aid at a designated site in the Al-Alam roundabout in the southern city of Rafah, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which has been run by Hamas since 2007.",
      "NBC News was not immediately able to verify the number of casualties. The World Health Organization has said it considers the Health Ministry\u2019s data reliable.",
      "The Israeli military said its troops had fired what it described as \u201cwarning fire\u201d at a number of people about a half kilometer, or 0.3 miles, away from an aid distribution site in Rafah, and that it was aware of and looking into reports of casualties.",
      "Troops identified several people moving toward them \u201cin such a way that posed a threat to them\u201d and appearing to deviate from designated aid access routes, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\u201cAfter the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced toward the troops,\u201d it said.",
      "It did not expand on what perceived threat those people posed.",
      "The group in charge of dispensing the aid, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, said that while it was distributed \u201csafely and without incident\" at the Rafah site, it understood that the IDF was investigating whether \"a number of civilians were injured after moving beyond the designated safe corridor and into a closed military zone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was an area well beyond our secure distribution site and operations area,\u201d the U.S. and Israel-backed group added. \u201cWe recognize the difficult nature of the situation and advise all civilians to remain in the safe corridor when traveling to our distribution sites.\u201d",
      "The new effort run by GHF has been condemned by established humanitarian groups, including the U.N. They warn that using a few distribution centers falls drastically short of what is needed and forces many Palestinians to travel long distances to access desperately needed supplies, risking further displacement. It also threatens the independence of humanitarian work while handing Israel more control over Gaza, critics say.",
      "On Monday, Gaza health officials said at least three people were killed and dozens more injured when Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians trying to get to a food distribution site in Rafah.",
      "The Israeli military said in a statement that troops had fired \u201cwarning shots\u201d to \u201cprevent several suspects approaching them,\u201d adding that the incident took place around 1 kilometer, or 0.6 miles, from a distribution site in the Tel al-Sultan area in Rafah. It said it was aware of reports of casualties and was looking into the incident.",
      "'Dropped to the ground'",
      "On Sunday, more than 30 people were killed in a similar event in Rafah, with hundreds injured, according to local health officials and aid workers. Speaking with NBC News' crew on the ground, four witnesses described coming under fire from the air and on the ground while they were waiting to collect aid near a distribution site.",
      "Several witnesses said the violence broke out just before 4 a.m. (9 p.m. Saturday ET), while another said it was around 6 a.m. (11 p.m. Saturday ET). At least three people described shelling from tanks, in addition to gunfire. Only the IDF is known to use tanks in Gaza."

      "That was exciting news for fans like Haerin Ouyang, a university student in the coastal Chinese city of Fuzhou, where the South Korean boy band Epex had been scheduled to perform on Saturday.",
      "But the show was canceled earlier this month, less than two weeks after it was announced, leaving Ouyang \u201cheartbroken.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,\u201d she said.",
      "C9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited \u201clocal circumstances\u201d in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.",
      "The ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.",
      "Before the ban, China \u2014 the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan \u2014 was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.",
      "\u201cIn the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China\u2019s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,\u201d said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.",
      "The China ban is estimated to have cost the South Korean economy almost $16 billion since 2016, she said.",
      "But the Epex concert\u2019s cancellation does not necessarily reflect the official position of the Chinese government, Kang cautioned, as China has been gradually reopening to South Korean culture after years of tension.",
      "While K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.",
      "A large-scale K-pop joint concert is also scheduled to be held in September at a 40,000-seat stadium in the Chinese island province of Hainan. The Korea Entertainment Producers\u2019 Association, which announced the event in April, did not reply to an email asking whether that concert is still going ahead.",
      "Kang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would \u201cproceed without issue.\u201d",
      "There are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China\u2019s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.",
      "\u201cIt shows that there is a greater opportunity for collaboration between the two countries, especially in the entertainment industry,\u201d said Ellen Kim, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. \u201cIt might be a starting point for industry-level cooperation that could open more doors between the two countries.\u201d",
      "The diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.",
      "China\u2019s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.",
      "In addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop\u2019s high-spending fans.",
      "China has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever.",
      "\u201cIt now has robust resilience against the \u2018invasion\u2019 of foreign content,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "A liberal lawyer was elected president of South Korea on Tuesday, ending months of political instability in the key U.S. ally that began with a botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the Democratic Party, was sworn into office Wednesday. His conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, of the People Power Party, said he humbly accepted \u201cthe choice of the people.\u201d",
      "According to the National Election Commission, Lee received 49.4% of the vote, while Kim received just over 41%. Another conservative candidate, Lee Jun-seok of the upstart Reform Party, received 8.3%.",
      "In his inauguration speech, Lee, 61, emphasized national unity after the martial law episode and said he would be \u201ca president who ends the politics of division.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will fully uncover the truth, assign proper responsibility and establish firm measures to prevent recurrence,\u201d he said.",
      "Lee said he would lead a \u201cpragmatic, market-oriented government\u201d and strengthen U.S.-South Korea relations and trilateral cooperation with the U.S. and Japan.",
      "In a departure from his predecessor, Lee also said he would engage in dialogue with rival North Korea while responding strongly to its nuclear and military provocations.",
      "\u201cWe will restore the military\u2019s honor and the public\u2019s trust, which were damaged by illegal martial law, and ensure that the military is never again mobilized for politics,\u201d he said.",
      "The election took place six months to the day after President Yoon Suk Yeol shocked the East Asian democracy of more than 50 million people by abruptly declaring martial law, citing threats from \u201canti-state forces\u201d and accusing the opposition-controlled parliament of paralyzing the government.",
      "Lawmakers pushed past soldiers Yoon had sent to parliament to vote unanimously against the order, which Yoon then withdrew.",
      "Led by Lee, lawmakers impeached Yoon on Dec. 14 over the short-lived order, after which South Korea was led by a series of acting presidents. The leadership vacuum has hampered South Korea in Washington as it is trying to negotiate with the Trump administration over a 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff and other levies.",
      "Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, had been considered the most likely next president since Yoon was impeached. The election was triggered in April when the Constitutional Court upheld his impeachment.",
      "But South Korean voters were animated more by anger at Yoon and his party than by an affinity for Lee.",
      "\u201cHis victory is not thanks to any particular policy proposals, but rather a result of Yoon\u2019s spectacular collapse,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.",
      "The martial law episode has deeply unsettled South Korea, which spent decades under military-authoritarian rule. It has also worsened polarization between liberals and conservatives, with regular rallies held for and against Yoon and a presidential campaign filled with personal attacks.",
      "Some voters directed their anger at Kim, the candidate for Yoon\u2019s former People Power Party, even though Yoon left the party last month to help his campaign.",
      "\u201cI believe that Lee will restore the democratic system and establish a democratic government,\u201d said Lee Jung Sup, a company executive in Seoul. \u201cThen our economy will be revitalized.\u201d",
      "Kim, who was labor minister under Yoon, criticized the martial law declaration but opposed his impeachment. Supporters pointed to Kim\u2019s squeaky-clean record, contrasting it with Lee\u2019s involvement in several criminal trials.",
      "\u201cIt is unfair to reflect the martial law declared by the former president onto Kim,\u201d said Oh Chang-soo, a retired religious leader in his 60s.",
      "Lee\u2019s vows to punish those involved in the martial law order have raised fears of further political turmoil. Yoon is still standing trial on charges of insurrection, a crime that is punishable by death or life in prison.",
      "Lee said this week that besides addressing economic concerns and internal division, his main priority is reaching a trade deal with the United States.",
      "In addition to the 25% tariff \u2014 which is set to take effect July 9 \u2014South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy is vulnerable to sector-specific U.S. levies on some of its most important exports, such as steel and automobiles.",
      "Asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s tendency to pressure his negotiating partners, Lee said, \u201cThat\u2019s a kind of political behavior exhibited by powerful nations, and we must endure it well.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the president of the Republic of Korea\u2019s kowtowing briefly would allow 52 million people to thrive, then he must do so,\u201d he told South Korea\u2019s Christian Broadcasting System on Monday, using the country\u2019s formal name.",
      "While Trump is a formidable figure, Lee said, diplomacy should be mutually beneficial, and \u201cI\u2019m not an easy opponent, either.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a fair number of cards to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things to give and take on both sides.\u201d"

      "The case received worldwide interest for several years, with reports of sightings of McCann occurring as far away as Australia, while books and television documentaries were produced about her disappearance.",
      "German investigators and Portuguese police officers and firefighters were searching in the countryside several miles from the Praia da Luz resort, where the 3-year-old disappeared from her bed while on vacation with her family on May 3, 2007.",
      "The teams were seen using pickaxes, shovels and chainsaws to clear dense vegetation and dig near a derelict building. Firefighters pumped water out of a well.",
      "Almost two decades on, investigators in the U.K., Portugal and Germany are still piecing together what happened on the night the toddler disappeared. She was in the same room as her brother and sister \u2014 2-year-old twins \u2014 while their parents, Kate and Gerry, had dinner with friends outside.",
      "Portuguese police said Monday that detectives were acting on a request from a German public prosecutor as they carry out \u201ca broad range\u201d of searches this week in the area of Lagos, in southern Portugal.",
      "The main suspect is a German national identified by media as Christian Brueckner, who is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for raping a 72-year-old woman in Portugal in 2005.",
      "He is under investigation on suspicion of murder in the McCann case but hasn\u2019t been charged. He spent many years in Portugal, including in Praia da Luz, around the time of the child\u2019s disappearance. Brueckner has denied any involvement.",
      "The last time police resumed searches in the case was in 2023, when detectives from the three countries took part in an operation searching near a dam and a reservoir about 30 miles from the resort.",
      "McCann\u2019s family marked the 18th anniversary of her disappearance last month and expressed their determination to keep searching."

    "story": [
      "When South Koreans elect a new president Tuesday, it will end months of domestic political turmoil \u2014 but their choice could bring big changes to the country\u2019s relationship with the United States.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, had a clear lead in polls going into the election, which is being held six months to the day after then-President Yoon Suk Yeol plunged the East Asian democracy of more than 50 million people into turmoil by abruptly declaring martial law.",
      "Since lawmakers impeached Yoon in December over the short-lived martial law order, South Korea has been stuck in a leadership vacuum, churning through a series of acting presidents. The uncertainty has also constrained the U.S. ally in Washington even as President Donald Trump slapped it with a 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff, among other levies.",
      "The presidential by-election, which was triggered in April when South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court upheld Yoon\u2019s impeachment, promises a return to stability, and South Koreans have turned out in record numbers for early voting.",
      "\u201cA lot of people just want to move on, because it\u2019s been a long six months,\u201d said Jennifer Lee, a principal at the Asia Group corporate consultancy in Washington, who recently returned from a trip to South Korea.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, 61, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, has been seen as the most likely next president since Yoon was impeached.",
      "But public support for Lee has been driven more by anger at Yoon\u2019s conservative People Power Party, which has declined to condemn his actions, than by agreement with Lee\u2019s policy positions, said Rob York, director for regional affairs at Pacific Forum, a foreign policy research institute in Honolulu.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think enthusiasm for him is especially strong,\u201d York said. \u201cHe\u2019s not an especially inspiring figure for a number of reasons, but the conservative party is simply so tainted right now.\u201d",
      "Further boosting Lee\u2019s chances is the fact that conservative votes are being split between Kim Moon Soo, the People Power Party candidate, and Lee Jun-seok, a young lawmaker from the upstart Reform Party who has been generating controversy with his antifeminist remarks.",
      "Though Lee has moved toward the center during the campaign, he is generally seen as more open to China and North Korea than his predecessor and less friendly toward Japan, which is part of a trilateral security partnership with the United States and South Korea.",
      "Because Yoon was \u201cso pro-U.S. and hardcore U.S.,\u201d it seems unlikely that the U.S.-South Korea relationship will remain as strong, the Asia Group\u2019s Jennifer Lee said.",
      "\u201cI think that there will be some more balancing act between the United States and China,\u201d she said, and if the Trump administration \u201ccomes out hard\u201d on issues such as tariffs or cost-sharing for the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, \u201cI think there may be a lot more frictions ahead.\u201d",
      "Still, Lee the candidate has expressed support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance and already begun reaching out to the Trump administration. In an interview last week with Time magazine, Lee said Trump \u201chas outstanding skills in terms of negotiation\u201d and that both he and Trump are simply looking out for the interests of their people.",
      "Though he doesn\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s conservative views, Lee has in the past been nicknamed \u201cKorea\u2019s Trump\u201d by supporters enamored with his populist, outspoken style.",
      "Like Trump, Lee also survived an attempt on his life last year, having been stabbed in the neck during a visit to the city of Busan.",
      "\u201cPersonality-wise I think the two of them, if they\u2019re in a room together, would probably get along,\u201d York said. \u201cBoth of them are people who view themselves as dealmakers, and I think they\u2019re more concerned with crafting a deal that makes both of them look good.\u201d",
      "One of Lee\u2019s top priorities will be reaching a deal on tariffs, which have hit South Korea hard. In addition to the 25% tariff, South Korea \u2014 the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy \u2014 is vulnerable to steep duties on some of its biggest exports, such as steel and automobiles.",
      "Lee is also facing a more assertive North Korea, whose leader, Kim Jong Un, has been advancing his ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. Like Trump, Lee favors greater engagement with the North, pledging last week to restore a military hotline between the two rivals, who technically remain at war.",
      "Though Trump has said he\u2019d like to revive his in-person diplomacy with Kim, North Korea appears far less interested in negotiating than it was when the two leaders met in 2018 and 2019. Kim is now receiving crucial economic and military support through a security partnership with Russia, and he said last year that North Korea is no longer pursuing reconciliation with the South.",
      "The heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula come amid reports that Trump is considering withdrawing thousands of U.S. troops from the South, an idea he also floated during his first term. Though Seoul says there have been no such discussions, Pentagon officials say a troop reduction has not been ruled out.",
      "Neither South Korea nor U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) were barely mentioned in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s speech in Singapore last weekend laying out the U.S. approach to the Indo-Pacific, adding to concerns about where the country stands with Washington.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. can unilaterally decide and act on reducing USFK troops. It\u2019s their military, after all,\u201d said Bong Young Sik, a North Korea specialist at the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, referring to U.S. Forces Korea.",
      "But \u201cthey need to consider and accommodate the situations their security partners are under and facing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf they go with \u2018What is good for the U.S. is good for the world,\u2019 I am not sure how long that approach could work,\u201d Bong said.",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong and Stella Kim from Los Angeles."
