      "\u201cIt was a profound honor to lead the men and women of CIA, and I hope in this new book to illuminate their remarkable service, and the crucial connection in this revolutionary new era between spycraft and statecraft,\u201d Burns, who headed the CIA from 2021-23 and was elevated by President Joe Biden to a cabinet position. A veteran diplomat, he was a key adviser to Biden on Russia, Ukraine and other parts of the world.",

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast plans to turn the success of his Amazon Prime Video reality competition series into millions of dollars for charity.",
      "YouTube\u2019s biggest creator is offering an exclusive weekend on the set of Beast Games Season 2 to the first 40 donors who make $100,000 gifts to his registered nonprofit. The earliest contributors and up to two guests each will spend June 27-29 touring MrBeast\u2019s North Carolina studio, hearing from the production team in a private Q&A and visiting Beast Philanthropy\u2019s food pantry.",
      "The invitation comes as Jimmy Donaldson\u2019s reported $5 billion media empire surpasses 400 million subscribers on YouTube, where he had already set the record for the biggest following. But the call raises a question: Who among his following of young people and their parents can make a six-figure donation?",
      "\u201cI have some big charity projects I want to fund so I think it\u2019s a win/win,\u201d MrBeast said in a post on X.",
      "Rallying his fervent fan base to make their own contributions marks a new fundraising strategy for Donaldson. He has long stated that his YouTube pages\u2019 featured charitable work is funded with his Beast Philanthropy channel\u2019s revenue.",
      "The content has drawn a mix of praise from fans for working with local nonprofits to support previously unfunded projects and pushback from critics who accused Donaldson of exploiting vulnerable people for clickbait \u201cinspiration porn.\u201d Campaigns have involved treating rheumatic heart disease in Nigeria and protecting endangered animals in Kenya. Other examples include building wells in countries across Africa and covering the cost of cataract surgery for 1,000 people.",
      "The call also signals Donaldson\u2019s continued philanthropic presence after comments suggesting he would get \u201cless hate\u201d if he stepped away from philanthropy altogether. Responding to allegations that he uses philanthropy as a shield, Donaldson said he thinks \u201cit paints a negative spotlight on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople hate me more because I do good,\u201d Donaldson said in a conversation uploaded last November on the YouTube channel oompaville. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s too crazy of a statement. I\u2019m not trying to sound like a victim here or anything.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe truth is, I just find videos where I help people more fun than videos where I don\u2019t,\u201d he added.",
      "Monday\u2019s announcement comes shortly after Amazon Prime Video renewed Beast Games for two more seasons. The reality competition series pitted 1,000 contestants against each other for a $5 million grand prize that doubled in the Feb. 13 finale. Forbes reported that the show broke the streaming service\u2019s record by totaling 50 million views in the 25 days after its premiere.",
      "MrBeast\u2019s latest fan event also follows reports that an April weekend experience billed as \u201cimmersive\u201d and \u201cunforgettable\u201d had fallen short of attendees\u2019 expectations.",

      "When he was first asked to lead the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number",
      "NEW YORK -- When he was first asked to helm the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number. It was just too delicious.",
      "\u201cWhen they sent it to me, I was cooking and I burnt dinner because my mind was spinning,\" he says. \"I was, like, \u2018This is a gift. I will never get an opening number like this again.\u2019\u201d",
      "So Gattelli worked out everything else about how to put Robert Zemeckis\u2019 1992 comic cult classic onto a stage and only then turned to the big, brassy song, \u201cFor the Gaze,\u201d a winking valentine to gay men, punning along the way.",
      "\u201cI was able to do the show and then have my full brain on that number because I knew the potential of what it could be,\u201d he says.",
      "What Gattelli crafted is an opening number for the ages, led by Megan Hilty: There are mid-song costume changes, dance breaks, chorus boys hoisting Hilty, spangly jumpsuits and tuxedos, high-kicking Vegas showgirls with feather headdresses, a body double doing somersaults, a rainbow flag of top-hatted dancers, and Hilty doing a Liza Minnelli cameo, all ending with the grand finale of Hilty as Judy Garland's Dorothy from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d complete with a little stuffed dog.",
      "\u201cI heard the pocket in that song, and I was like, \u2018I know there\u2019s a giant laugh there. I can hear giant laughs, what\u2019s that giant laugh?'\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest gay reference? Then I literally I just worked backwards.\u201d",
      "That number telegraphs to the audience exactly what to expect for the rest of the night \u2014 a perfectly rehearsed, lushly costumed, silly, self-aware comedy.",
      "\u201cOnce we hit \u2018For the Gaze,\u2019 the audience knows exactly what the show is,\" he says. \"And then I think they\u2019re in for the ride.\u201d",
      "The work on \u201cFor the Gaze\u201d has helped Gattelli see his show earn 10 Tony Award nominations, including one for his Broadway debut as a director and another for his choreography.",
      "The musical is based on the film, which starred Meryl Streep as a self-centered actor and Goldie Hawn as her suffering-in-the-shadows writer friend. Their mutual desperate measures for achieving eternal youth turn comically grotesque. Hilty plays the Streep role, while Jennifer Simard plays the Hawn one.",
      "\u201cIt felt like just the perfect fit for what I do and what I love to do,\" Gattelli says. \"I love comedy and I love to direct comedy and I love to do these big splashy numbers. It felt like everything I\u2019ve been itching to do.\u201d",
      "Gattelli \u2014 who was a dancer in the original \u201cCats\u201d \u2014 has been a mainstay on Broadway of late, able to choreograph such venerable works as \u201cThe King and I\u201d and \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d but also irreverent musicals as \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d and the jukebox variety, like \u201cThe Cher Show.\u201d",
      "He made his directing debut off-Broadway in 2011 with \u201cSilence!\u201d a parody musical of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d complete with a chorus of dancing lambs running across the stage.",
      "Lowe Cunningham, lead producer of \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d saw it in Los Angeles and later asked Gattelli about the experience, how he collaborated and his approach to the work. She was impressed by his openness to all ideas and his caring.",
      "\u201cI think first and foremost, his talent is clear and it\u2019s been out there in the world of choreography for a long time. He is innovative, he does things other people aren\u2019t doing, but the other thing is that he\u2019s renowned as being an incredibly kind human being,\u201d she says.",
      "Gattelli, who won a 2012 Tony for choreographing \u201cNewsies the Musical\u201d \u2014 one of his show-stopping moments was dancers sliding on newspapers \u2014 was brought in relatively late to \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d only a year and half before opening on Broadway.",
      "\u201cIt was a great lesson in trusting your instincts,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said, \u2018We want a lush, opulent, sexy, magical sparkling evening.\u2019 And we just started taking big swings.\u201d",
      "It started with \u2014 of all things \u2014 the curtain. The audience filing into the theater is greeted by a purple, royal fabric. \u201cWhen people walk in, they immediately feel like that it\u2019s lush and sexy and mysterious.\u201d",
      "The musical is filled with very funny special effects that are decidedly low-tech. At one point, the two leading ladies are replaced by two men duking it out in dresses and wigs. The audience roars at the deception and Gattelli even advised one of the male combatants not to shave his arm hair.",
      "\u201cThe audience is in on the joke,\u201d he says. \u201cI love that they go on that ride with us. They\u2019re laughing with us. We\u2019re all laughing together and it feels good.\u201d",
      "One scene from the movie needed a lot of planning to make it on stage: The tumble down the elegant mansion stairs by Hilty's character. Hollywood CGI magic would have to be replicated by Broadway ingenuity.",
      "\u201cThe people that know the movie and the fans especially are going to go, \u2018How are they going to do it?\u2019 It was keeping me up at night forever because we tried everything,\u201d says Gattelli.",
      "The creative team \u2014 which also included set designer Derek McLane, lighting designer Justin Townsend and sound designer Peter Hylenski \u2014 decided to make it a dance punctuated by sound effects.",
      "Warren Yang \u2014 an actor with a gymnastics background \u2014 wears Hilty's outfit and a wig as he tumbles slowly, acrobatically and theatrically down the stairs, somersaulting as thunder sounds crash and we hear what seems like bones cracking. (The stairs were made of the rubber Neoprene for safety.)",
      "\u201cThere are very simple techniques that make a big impact,\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cI just went back to it\u2019s a beautiful, lush, gorgeous show, but, at the core, it\u2019s just theatrical magic and stagecraft.\u201d",

      "\u201cLilo & Stich\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u2014The Final Reckoning\u201d dominated the box office charts again after fueling a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend. Theaters in the U.S. and Canada had several new films to offer this weekend as well, including Sony\u2019s family friendly \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d and the A24 horror movie \u201cBring Her Back. \u201d According to studio estimates Sunday, it added up to a robust $149 million post-holiday weekend that\u2019s up over 120% from the same timeframe last year.",
      "Disney\u2019s live-action hybrid \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d took first place again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. It was enough to pass \u201cSinners\u201d to become the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Globally, its running total is $610.8 million. \u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, is still going strong in its seventh weekend with another $5.2 million, bumping it to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million globally.",
      "The eighth \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie also repeated in second place, with $27.3 million from 3,861 locations. As with \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d that's down 57% from its opening. With $122.6 million in domestic tickets sold, it\u2019s performing in line with the two previous installments. But with a reported production budget of $400 million, profitability is a ways off. Internationally, it added $76.1 million (including $25.2 million from China where it just opened), bringing its global total to $353.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis is the year of longterm playability,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst. \u201cThe currency of word of mouth and the strong hold is more important than opening weekend dollars.\u201d",
      "Leading the newcomers was Sony\u2019s \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d with an estimated $21 million from 3,809 locations. The movie brings Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio together to train a new kid, the kung fu prodigy Li Fong ( Ben Wang ). Chan starred in a 2010 reboot of the 1984 original, while Macchio has found a new generation of fans in the series \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d which just concluded a six-season run.",
      "Reviews might have been mixed, but opening weekend audiences gave the PG-13 rated film a strong A- CinemaScore and 4.5 stars on PostTrak. It also only cost a reported $45 million to produce and has several weeks until a new family-friendly film arrives. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d opened earlier internationally and has a worldwide total of $47 million.",
      "Fourth place went \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d which earned $10.8 million in its third weekend. The movie is the highest-grossing in the franchise, not accounting for inflation, with $229.3 million globally.",
      "The weekend\u2019s other big newcomer, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d rounded out the top five with $7.1 million from 2,449 screens. Starring Sally Hawkins as a foster mother with some disturbing plans, the film is the sophomore feature of twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou, who made the 2023 horror breakout \u201cTalk to Me.\u201d It earned a rare-for-horror B+ CinemaScore and is essentially the only new film in the genre until \u201c28 Years Later\u201d opens on June 20.",
      "A new Wes Anderson movie, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d also debuted in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, where it made $270,000. It expands nationwide next weekend.",
      "The summer box office forecast remains promising, though there\u2019s a long way to go to get to the $4 billion target (a pre-pandemic norm that only the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer has surpassed). The month of May is expected to close out with $973 million \u2013 up 75% from May 2024, according to data from Comscore.",

      "\u201cThis is a dream job for a composer,\u201d Clausen told Variety, which first reported his death, in 1998. \u201cMatt Groening said to me very early on, \u2018We\u2019re not a cartoon. We\u2019re a drama where the characters are drawn. I want you to score it like a drama.\u2019 I score the emotions of the characters as opposed to specific action hits on the screen.\u201d",

      "In the 1970s he was a musical director on several TV variety shows including \u201cDonny & Marie.\u201d",
      "Clausen worked as an orchestrator for composer Lee Holdridge in his scores for 1980s films including \u201cSplash\u201d and \u201cThe Beastmaster.\u201d",
      "It was Holdridge who first got the composing job on \u201cMoonlighting,\" the late-80s ABC rom-com detective series starring Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd, but he handed the gig off to Clausen, who would get six Emmy nominations for his music on it.",
      "Clausen won his Emmys for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in 1997 and 1998 and also won five Annie Awards, which honor work in animation in film and television.",
      "He was fired from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in a cost-cutting move in 2017, to the outrage of his collaborators and fans. He sued over his dismissal.",

      "The multi-platinum singer had been scheduled to headline the opening celebrations Saturday night at Nationals Park. The reasons are apparently an extension of equipment issues related to her Thursday night concert in Boston's Fenway Park, which was also cancelled hours before it was set to begin.

      "The cancellation presents a further challenge for the Alliance, but at least a non-political one. Organizers have already said they expected international attendance to measurably suffer as a result of concern and anger in the LGBTQ+ community over President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Trump\u2019s public antipathy for trans protections and drag shows has already prompted two international LGBTQ+ organizations, Eagle Canada and the African Human Rights Coalition, to issue warnings against traveling to the U.S. at all. The primary concern is that trans or non-binary individuals would face trouble entering the country if passport control officers enforce the administration\u2019s strict binary view of gender status.",
      "Some potential international participants have already announced plans to skip this year\u2019s events, either out of fear of harassment or as a boycott against Trump\u2019s policies. But others have called for a domestic mobilization to flood the capital.",

      "PBS was joined as a plaintiff by one of its stations, Lakeland PBS, which serves rural areas in northern and central Minnesota. Trump's order is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the station, the lawsuit said.",
      "A PBS spokesman said that \u201cafter careful deliberation, PBS reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television\u2019s editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations.\u201d",
      "Through an executive order earlier this month, Trump told the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to stop funding the two systems. Through the corporation alone, PBS is receiving $325 million this year, most of which goes directly to individual stations.",
      "PBS, which makes much of the programming used by the stations, said it gets 22% of its revenue directly from the feds. Sixty-one percent of PBS' budget is funded through individual station dues, and the stations raise the bulk of that money through the government.",
      "Trump's order \u201cwould have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS member stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans,\u201d Chen wrote.",
      "PBS said the U.S. Department of Education has canceled a $78 million grant to the system for educational programming, used to make children's shows like \u201cSesame Street,\u201d \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog\u201d and \u201cReading Rainbow.\u201d",
      "For Minnesota residents, the order threatens the \u201cLakeland Learns\u201d education program and \u201cLakeland News,\u201d described in the lawsuit as the only television program in the region providing local news, weather and sports.",
      "Besides Trump, the lawsuit names other administration officials as defendants, including Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. PBS says its technology is used as a backup for the nationwide wireless emergency alert system.",
      "The administration has fought with several media organizations. Government-run news services like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are struggling for their lives, The Associated Press has battled with the White House over press access and the Federal Communications Commission is investigating television news divisions.",

      "Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy Awards playing Major Margaret Houlihan on the pioneering hit TV series \u201cM.A.S.H.,\" has died. She was 87.",
      "NEW YORK -- Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy Awards playing Major Margaret Houlihan, the demanding head nurse of a behind-the-lines surgical unit during the Korean War on the pioneering hit TV series \u201cM.A.S.H.,\u201d has died. She was 87.",
      "Publicist Harlan Boll says Swit died Friday at her home in New York City, likely from natural causes.",
      "Swit and Alan Alda were the longest-serving cast members on \u201cM.A.S.H.,\u201d which was based on Robert Altman\u2019s 1970 film, which was itself based on a novel by Richard Hooker, the pseudonym of H. Richard Hornberger.",
      "The CBS show aired for 11 years from 1972 to 1983, revolving around life at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, which gave the show its name. The two-and-a-half-hour finale on Feb. 28, 1983, lured over 100 million viewers, the most-watched episode of any scripted series ever.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine put \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d at No. 25 of the best TV shows of all time, while Time Out put it at No. 34. It won the Impact Award at the 2009 TV Land annual awards. It won a Peabody Award in 1975 \u201cfor the depth of its humor and the manner in which comedy is used to lift the spirit and, as well, to offer a profound statement on the nature of war.\u201d",
      "In Altman\u2019s 1970 film, Houlihan was a one-dimensional character \u2014 a prickly, rules-bound head nurse who was regularly tormented by male colleagues, who gave her the nickname \u201cHot Lips.\u201d Her intimate moments were broadcast to the entire camp after somebody planted a microphone under her bed.",
      "Sally Kellerman played Houlihan in the movie version and Swit took it over for TV, eventually deepening and creating her into a much fuller character. Her sexuality was played down and she wasn\u2019t even called \u201cHot Lips\u201d in the later years.",
      "The growing awareness of feminism in the \u201970s spurred Houlihan\u2019s transformation from caricature to real person, but a lot of the change was due to Swit\u2019s influence on the scriptwriters.",
      "\u201cAround the second or third year I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes,\u201d Swit told Suzy Kalter, author of \u201cThe Complete Book of \u2018M.A.S.H.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cTo oversimplify it, I took each traumatic change that happened in her life and kept it. I didn\u2019t go into the next episode as if it were a different character in a different play. She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.\u201d",
      "\u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d wasn\u2019t an instant hit. It finished its first season in 46th place, out of 75 network TV series, but it nabbed nine Emmy nominations. It was rewarded with a better time slot for its sophomore season, paired on Saturday nights with \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d then TV\u2019s highest-rated show. At the 1974 Emmys, it was crowned best comedy, with Alda winning as best comedy actor.",
      "The series also survived despite cast churn. In addition to Swit and Alda, the first season featured Wayne Rogers, McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville and Gary Burghoff. Harry Morgan, Mike Farrell and David Ogden Stiers would later be added, while Jamie Farr and William Christopher had expanded roles.",
      "\u201cLoretta Swit\u2019s portrayal of Margaret \u2018Hot Lips\u2019 Houlihan was groundbreaking \u2014 bringing heart, humor, and strength to one of television comedy\u2019s most enduring roles. Her talent extended well beyond that iconic character, with acclaimed work on both stage and screen that showcased her intelligence, versatility, and passion,\" National Comedy Center Executive Director Journey Gunderson said in a statement.",
      "Swit appeared in all but 11 episodes of the series, nearly four times longer than the Korean War itself, exploring issues like PTSD, sexism and racism. Swit pushed for a better representation for women.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I liked, with Loretta\u2019s prodding, was every time I had a chance to write for her character, we\u2019d get away from the Hot Lips angle and find out more about who Margaret was. She became more of a real person,\u201d Alda told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018.",
      "The series ended on a happy note for Houlihan, who spends much of the finale debating whether she wants to head to Tokyo or Belgium for her next overseas post. Ultimately she opts to return to America and work at a hospital, citing her father \u2014 a career Army man.",
      "Swit didn\u2019t personally agree that was the correct decision for a military-minded official: \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was correct for my Margaret,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment in 2023. \u201cI think her next move was Vietnam. So I didn\u2019t agree with that, but that\u2019s what they wanted her to do.\u201d",
      "But the actor did get to write the speech that Houlihan delivers to her fellow nurses on their final night together, in which she says: \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor and privilege to have worked with you. And I\u2019m very, very proud to have known you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was consumed with writing that. And I still get letters from women all over the world who became nurses because of Margaret Houlihan. To have contributed to someone\u2019s life like that is remarkable,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment.",
      "During her run, Houlihan had an affair with Hawkeye\u2019s foil, the bumbling Frank Burns, played by Linville in the TV version, and in Season 5, Houlihan returns from a stay in Tokyo engaged to a handsome lieutenant colonel, a storyline that Swit says she advocated for with the writers.",
      "\u201cI told them: \u2018Can you imagine what fun you\u2019re going to have with Larry when I come back to town and I tell him I\u2019m engaged? He\u2019ll rip the doors off of the mess tent!\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what they had him do. So we were all of the same mind.\u201d",
      "Toward the end, Swit was tempted to leave the show. She played the role of Chris Cagney in a 1981 television movie, \u201cCagney & Lacey,\u201d and was offered the part when it was picked up as a midseason series for the spring of 1982. But producers insisted she stay with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d for its last two seasons.",
      "Swit told The Florida Times-Union in 2010 she might have stayed with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d anyway. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but get better as an actor working with scripts like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in something that literate, well, we got spoiled.\u201d",
      "In 2022, James Poniewozik, The New York Times\u2019s chief television critic, looked back on the show and said it held up well: \u201cIts blend of madcap comedy and pitch-dark drama \u2014 the laughs amplifying the serious stakes, and vice versa \u2014 is recognizable in today\u2019s dramedies, from \u2018Better Things\u2019 to \u2018Barry,\u2019 that work in the DMZ between laughter and sadness.\u201d",
      "After the TV series, Swit became a vocal animal welfare activist, selling SwitHeart perfume and her memoir through her official website, with proceeds benefiting various animal-related nonprofit groups.",
      "In 1983, she married actor Dennis Holahan, whom she\u2019d met when he was a guest star on \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d They divorced in 1995.",
      "Born in Passaic, New Jersey, the daughter of Polish immigrants, Swit enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, then paid her dues for years in touring productions.",
      "In 1969, she arrived in Hollywood and was soon seen in series such as \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d \u201cHawaii Five-O,\u201d \u201cMission Impossible\u201d and \u201cBonanza.\u201d Then in 1972, she got her big break when she was asked to audition for the role of \u201cHot Lips.\u201d",
      "She would regularly return to theater, starring on Broadway in 1975 in \u201cSame Time, Next Year\u201d and \u201cThe Mystery of Edwin Drood\u201d in 1986. She was in \u201cAmorous Crossing,\u201d a romantic comedy, at Alhambra Theatre & Dining in 2010 and in North Carolina Theatre\u2019s production of \u201cMame\u201d in 2003.",

      "The lighthouse appeared overnight",
      "MARSEILLE, France -- The lighthouse appeared overnight. Painted on a wall tucked away in a quiet Marseille street, its beam aligned perfectly with the real-life shadow of a metal post on the pavement. At its center, stenciled in crisp white, are the words: \u201cI want to be what you saw in me.\u201d",
      "Banksy had struck again.",
      "On Friday, the elusive British street artist confirmed the work by posting two images on his official Instagram account \u2014 without caption or coordinates. Fans quickly identified the location as 1 Rue F\u00e9lix Fr\u00e9gier, in the Catalans district of Marseille\u2019s 7th arrondissement, near the sea.",
      "Since then, crowds have gathered at the site. Tourists snap photos. Children point. Locals who usually walk past the building stop to take a closer look.",
      "There is no official explanation for the phrase. But its emotional pull is unmistakable \u2014 a quiet plea for recognition, love or redemption. Some speculate it references a country ballad by Lonestar. Others call it a love letter. Or a lament. Or both.",
      "The image is deceptively simple: a lone lighthouse, dark and weathered, casting a stark white beam. But what gives it power is the way it plays with light \u2014 the real and the painted, the seen and the imagined. The post in front of the wall becomes part of the piece. Reality becomes the frame.",
      "Marseille\u2019s mayor, Beno\u00eet Payan, was quick to react online. \u201cMarseille x Banksy,\u201d he wrote, adding a flame emoji. By midday, the hashtag #BanksyMarseille was trending across France, and beyond.",
      "Though often political, Banksy\u2019s art is just as often personal, exploring themes of loss, longing and identity. In recent years, his works have appeared on war-ravaged buildings in Ukraine, in support of migrants crossing the Mediterranean and on walls condemning capitalism, Brexit, and police brutality.",
      "The artist, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world\u2019s best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \u201cLaugh now, but one day I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d",
      "His work has sold for millions of dollars at auction, and past murals on outdoor sites have often been stolen or removed by building owners soon after going up. In December 2023, after Banksy stenciled military drones on a stop sign in south London, a man was photographed taking down the sign with bolt cutters. Police later arrested two men on suspicion of theft and criminal damage.",
      "In March 2024, an environmentally themed work on a wall beside a tree in north London was splashed with paint, covered with plastic sheeting and fenced off within days of being created.",
      "Despite the fame \u2014 or infamy \u2014 at least in Marseille, not everyone walking past noticed it. Some didn\u2019t even know who Banksy was, according to the local press.",
      "On Instagram observers say this Marseille piece feels quieter. More interior.",
      "And yet, it is no less global. The work arrives just ahead of a major Banksy retrospective opening June 14 at the Museum of Art in nearby Toulon featuring 80 works, including rare originals. Another exhibit opens Saturday in Montpellier.",
      "But the Marseille mural wasn\u2019t meant for a museum. It lives in the street, exposed to weather, footsteps and time. As of Friday evening, no barriers had been erected. No glass shield installed. Just a shadow, a beam and a message that\u2019s already circling the world.",

      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Former Japanese princess Mako Komuro has given birth to her first child, palace officials confirmed Friday, though they gave no details, saying she is no longer a royal member.",
      "The Imperial Household Agency said both the mother and child are in good health, but did not disclose the baby's date of birth or gender.",
      "The former princess, 33, is a niece of Emperor Naruhito. She married a former college classmate Kei Komuro, a commoner, and renounced her royal status in 2021 as required by Japan's Imperial House Law. Days after their marriage, the couple moved to New York where her husband works as a lawyer.",
      "Officials said that while the birth involved a former royal, the palace decided to publicly confirm the news after media reports earlier this month on the baby's arrival. They added that they hoped Mako would live in a quiet environment.",
      "Mako's parents, Crown Prince Akishino and his wife Kiko, and younger siblings \u2014 Princess Kako and Prince Hisahito \u2014 are delighted and wished Mako's family happiness, officials said.",
      "Japanese tabloid magazine Josei Seven recently published images of Mako and Kei Komuro seen walking with a baby stroller in a neighborhood of New York.",
      "Mako and her husband met at Tokyo\u2019s International Christian University. They announced in September 2017 their intention to marry the following year, but the wedding was suspended for four years due to a financial dispute involving Kei Komuro's mother.",
      "Due to the controversy, Mako also declined a dowry to which she was entitled for leaving the imperial family.",
      "Mako\u2019s loss of royal status comes from the Imperial House Law, which allows only male succession.",
      "The rule leaves only Akishino and his son Hisahito in line to succeed Naruhito. A government panel is discussing a more stable succession system, but conservatives reject female succession and only plan to allow female royals to help perform public duties after marriage.",

      "Prosecutors said that the offenses took place between 1999 and 2005 \u2014 one in the English seaside town of Bournemouth and the other three in London.",
      "Brand didn't speak to reporters as he arrived at court wearing dark sunglasses, a suit jacket, a black collared shirt open below his chest and black jeans. In his right hand, he clutched a copy of the \u201cThe Valley of Vision,\u201d a collection of Puritan prayers.",
      "The \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor known for risqu\u00e9 stand-up routines, battles with drugs and alcohol, has dropped out of the mainstream media in recent years and built a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories, as well as discussing religion.",
      "On a five-minute prayer video he posted Monday on social media, Brand wrote: \u201cJesus, thank you for saving my life.\u201d",

      "Big Ocean, the world\u2019s first K-pop group composed entirely of deaf and hard-of-hearing artists, is breaking barriers with high-tech tools and inclusive performances",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Big Ocean, a three-member K-pop group composed entirely of artists with hearing disabilities, is redefining the limits of music and performance \u2014 one beat at a time.",
      "When Big Ocean takes the stage, they seamlessly incorporate sign language into their performances. But their polished shows are built on extensive preparation using high-tech tools born from necessity \u2014 vibrating smartwatches that pulse with musical beats and LED visual metronomes that flash timing cues during practice sessions. This technological approach represents significant progress in South Korea\u2019s entertainment industry, where career opportunities for people with disabilities have historically been limited.",
      "The trio, PJ, Jiseok and Chanyeon, made their debut in April 2024 and recently wrapped a solo European tour marking their first anniversary. The band performed in four countries, including France and the U.K., while promoting their second mini-album, \u201cUnderwater,\u201d which dropped on April 20.",
      "PJ rose to prominence as a YouTuber who educated viewers about hearing disabilities. Chanyeon previously worked as an audiologist. Jiseok was a professional ski racer.",
      "To achieve the precision crucial in K-pop\u2019s demanding choreography and music, Big Ocean relies on technologies rarely seen in the genre. Members wear modified vibrating smartwatches that deliver rhythmic cues to their wrists and practice with visual metronomes \u2014 flashing light guides displayed on monitors \u2014 to help stay in sync when audio alone isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Chanyeon uses a hybrid hearing device with Bluetooth that streams music directly from mobile devices. The group also uses a pitch-checking app and AI voice conversion technology to support vocal training and enhance audio output after recordings.",
      "\u201cWe each felt rhythm differently when dancing,\u201d PJ told The Associated Press. \u201cSo when we\u2019d play the same song and dance in front of the mirror, one of us would move faster while another would move slower. To solve this timing issue, we decided to memorize everything together and create our own cues with each other.\u201d",
      "This precision becomes critical during live performances, where unexpected disruptions can derail even experienced performers. \u201cWhen we performed in France, our fans were cheering so loudly we lost the beat,\u201d said Jiseok. \u201cBut we looked at each other and quickly handled the situation \u2014 just like we practiced.\u201d",
      "Stage effects and certain musical styles create additional obstacles. \u201cWhen a lot of smoke comes up, sometimes we momentarily can\u2019t see the stage movements in front of us,\u201d PJ said. \u201cOur concentration gets disrupted instantly in those moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s no clear beat in a song, it\u2019s really hard for us to stay synchronized,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen the bass is overwhelming, it\u2019s difficult for us to catch it accurately.\u201d",
      "Despite these challenges, Big Ocean\u2019s commitment to accessibility and inclusion has inspired their global fanbase. Big Ocean\u2019s global fanbase \u2014 known as PADO \u2014 has responded with similar commitment.",
      "\u201cWhile communicating with PADO, we\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re actually learning Korean sign language for us, or learning various sign languages to communicate with us,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen we see how much they\u2019re preparing and putting in that effort, we feel so grateful.\u201d",

      "A New Zealand flag printed with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d and displayed on the floor of an art gallery in the city of Nelson has been removed from display after protests, the gallery said Thursday",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand flag printed with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d and laid on the floor of an art gallery has once again been packed away following public outcry, 30 years after protests forced the removal of the same artwork.",
      "The Suter Art Gallery in the city of Nelson said Thursday it had taken down the work by M\u0101ori artist Diane Prince due to escalating tensions and safety fears. The episode mirrored an Auckland gallery's removal of the work amid public backlash and complaints to law enforcement in 1995.",
      "This time, the flag was meant to remain on display for five months. Instead, it lasted just 19 days, reigniting long-running debates in New Zealand over artistic expression, national symbols and the country\u2019s colonial history.",
      "Police told The Associated Press on Friday that officers were investigating \u201cseveral\u201d complaints about the exhibition.",
      "The piece, titled Flagging the Future, is a cloth New Zealand flag displayed on the floor with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d stenciled across it. The flag features the British Union Jack and red stars on a blue background.",
      "The work was part of an exhibition, Diane Prince: Activist Artist, and was meant to provoke reflection on the M\u0101ori experience since New Zealand's colonization by Britain in the 19th century. Prince created the piece in 1995 in response to a government policy that limited compensation to M\u0101ori tribes for historical land theft.",
      "\u201cI have no attachment to the New Zealand flag,\u201d Prince told Radio New Zealand in 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t call myself a New Zealander. I call myself a M\u0101ori.\u201d",
      "Prince couldn\u2019t be reached immediately for comment Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s reckoning with its colonial past has gathered pace in recent decades. But there has been little appetite among successive governments to sever the country\u2019s remaining constitutional ties to Britain or change the flag to a design that doesn't feature the Union Jack.",
      "New Zealand is among countries where desecrating the national flag is considered taboo and prohibited by law. Damaging a flag in public with intent to dishonor it is punishable by a fine of up to 5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,984), but prosecutions are fleetingly rare.",
      "As in the United States and elsewhere, the country\u2019s flag is synonymous for some with military service. But for others, particularly some M\u0101ori, it\u2019s a reminder of land dispossession, and loss of culture and identity.",
      "Protests of the artwork in the city of Nelson, population 55,000, included videos posted to social media by a local woman, Ruth Tipu, whose grandfather served in the army\u2019s M\u0101ori Battalion during World War II. In one clip, she is seen lifting the flag from the floor and draping it over another artwork, an action Tipu said she would repeat daily.",
      "A veterans\u2019 group also denounced the piece as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d City council member Tim Skinner said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the work\u2019s inclusion.",
      "But others welcomed it. Nelson\u2019s deputy mayor, Rohan O\u2019Neill-Stevens, posted on social media \u201cin strong defense of artistic expression and the right for us all to be challenged and confronted by art.\u201d",
      "The work was perhaps expected to provoke controversy and in the exhibition\u2019s opening days, The Suter Gallery defended its inclusion. But a statement on its Facebook page late Thursday said a \u201csharp escalation in the tone and nature of the discourse, moving well beyond the bounds of respectful debate\u201d had prompted the flag\u2019s removal.",
      "\u201cThis should not be interpreted as a judgement on the artwork or the artist\u2019s intent,\u201d the statement said. The gallery didn\u2019t detail specific incidents of concern and a gallery spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for an interview on Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s Police said in a statement Friday that while officers were investigating complaints, they weren\u2019t called to any disturbances at the exhibition. Prince said when she revived the work in 2024 that threats of prosecution by law enforcement had prompted its removal from the Auckland gallery in 1995.",

      "As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it",
      "NEW YORK -- As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it.",
      "We should all be so alive and so remembered at his age. Fogerty, in the midst of an international tour, played a rowdy 100-minute set Thursday night to an adoring, near-capacity audience at Manhattan's Beacon Theatre. Crowd members spanned from those likely to remember \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cFortunate Son\u201d and other Creedence Clearwater Revival hits when first released a half-century ago to those looking young enough to have heard about them through their grandparents.",
      "At least from a distance, Fogerty didn't look or sound much different from his prime with Creedence, which was rarely off the charts between 1969 and 1971. He wore his trademark flannel shirt; had the same shaggy haircut, although with his bangs brushed back; sang with a vintage roar that has mellowed only slightly; and even played the same guitar, a Rickenbacker, that he had acquired back in the late '60s.",
      "Fogerty presented himself as a proud rock \u2018n' roller, and a very proud family man. His band includes two of his sons on guitar, Shane and Tyler, with daughter Kelsy briefly joining them on a third guitar. Off to the side was his wife, Julie, whom he praised as the love and the hero of his life, if only because she gave one of the greatest gifts an old rock star could ask for: She helped win back rights to his song catalogue. Fogerty had battled over his copyrights for decades, and at one point found himself being sued for plagiarizing one of his Creedence hits, which at the time he didn\u2019t own.",
      "He has marked his victory with an upcoming album, \u201cLegacy,\u201d for which he recorded new versions of 20 songs. If you were in the house Thursday night, you couldn't help hearing about it. A promotional film about \u201cLegacy\u201d opened the show and Fogerty mentioned it again before his encore set. Both the album, subtitled \u201cThe Creedence Clearwater Revival Years,\u201d and his concert tell a story of how he wants to look back.",
      "As Fogerty noted at one point Thursday night, Creedence Clearwater Revival soared to the highest heights before imploding bitterly in the early \u201870s and never again recording or touring together. Only Creedence diehards would have known the identity of the other band members \u2014 drummer Doug Clifford, bassist Stu Cook, and guitarist Tom Fogerty, John\u2019s brother, who died in 1990. Their names were never mentioned, their faces near-invisible among the rush of images that appeared Thursday on a screen behind Fogerty and his band. The new tracks on \u201cLegacy,\u201d each labeled \u201cJohn's Version,\u201d leave only John Fogerty from the original group.",
      "The Beacon show was very much about where is he now, and how much he likes it. He dashed about the stage, rocked out on his Rickenbacker with the joy of a teenager on air guitar and even poured himself champagne. Fans clapped and danced, while being showered with confetti and dazzled with lasers and fog. The more informed sang along with \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain\u201d and the baseball anthem \u201cCenterfield,\" Fogerty's most famous post-Creedence song. Virtually all stood and cheered to serenade the night\u2019s guest of honor, whose birthday was the day before.",

      "Trump's status as a \u201ccontent creator\u201d was also damaged by attention given to the interview, lawyers said. It was part of their argument opposing CBS parent Paramount Global's effort to dismiss the president's $20 billion lawsuit against the company, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. Trump has claimed the editing was done to advantage Harris, which CBS rejects.",
      "Even with the effort to dismiss the case, Paramount is engaged in settlement discussions with Trump. The prospect of a settlement has so rattled CBS News that two of its top executives have resigned in protest.",
      "Trump, who did not agree to be interviewed by \u201c60 Minutes\" during the campaign, has protested editing where Harris is seen giving two different answers to a question by the show's Bill Whitaker in separate clips aired on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cFace the Nation\u201d earlier in the day. CBS said each reply came within Harris' long-winded answer to Whitaker, but was edited to be more succinct.",
      "Trump's lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, said that \u201cthis led to widespread confusion and mental anguish of consumers, including plaintiffs, regarding a household name of the legacy media apparently deceptively distorting its broadcasts, and then resisting attempts to clear the public record.\u201d",
      "Because they were misled, voters withheld attention from Trump and his Truth Social platform, Paltzik argued.",
      "Trump, described as a \u201cmedia icon\u201d by his lawyers, was \u201cforced to redirect significant time, money and effort to correcting the public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Paramount and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone are seeking the settlement with Trump, whose administration must approve the company's proposed merger with Skydance Media. CBS News' president and CEO, Wendy McMahon, and \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens, who both opposed a settlement, have resigned in recent weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a media advocacy group that says it is a Paramount shareholder, said that it would file a lawsuit in protest if a settlement is reached.",
      "Seth Stern, the foundation's advocacy director, said a settlement of Trump's \u201cmeritless\u201d lawsuit \u201cmay well be a thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system.\u201d U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said they are investigating whether a settlement would violate bribery laws.",

      "The number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000, a British law firm said on Monday.",
      "Rylands Garth, based in London, said more than 520 ex-players from rugby union and rugby league joined the lawsuit by Friday last week, which was the deadline for new applicants set by a court ahead of a hearing in July and before the case potentially goes to trial next year.",
      "It takes the total number of players who are part of the lawsuit to approximately 1,100, Rylands Garth said in a statement.",
      "The former players contend, according to Rylands Garth, that \u201crugby governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect them from the impacts of concussive and sub-concussive blows during their playing careers, despite knowing of the risks.\u201d",
      "Claimants are seeking compensation from World Rugby, the English Rugby Football Union and Welsh Rugby Union \u2014 governing bodies in 15-a-side rugby \u2014 and the English Rugby Football League and British Amateur Rugby League Association \u2014 from 13-a-side rugby league \u2014 for lost earnings, medical bills and care costs associated with their injuries, the firm said.",
      "\u201cRylands Garth is also calling for urgent and substantive reform of the game to better protect the safety of current and future players \u2014 including the creation of an independent brain health ombudsman for the sport,\u201d it said.",
      "Among those to have previously joined the class action was World Cup-winning former England hooker Steve Thompson, former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman and former Wales flanker Alix Popham.",
      "\u201cThis surge in claimants exposes the deep-rooted issues in rugby,\u201d Rylands Garth said, adding: \"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement issued by World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU, the governing bodies said they \u201care aware of the latest update shared by the claimants\u2019 legal representatives with the final number of claimants.\u201d",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.",
      "The 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.",
      "Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.",
      "Kennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d",
      "His comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.",
      "Some worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.",
      "Ohio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who's 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d",
      "While announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.",
      "For Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.",
      "Daniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.",
      "\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d",
      "The Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.",
      "\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d",
      "Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.",
      "Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.",
      "At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.",
      "Lamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.",
      "\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d",
      "Copeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.",
      "Ashley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.",
      "\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d",
      "Doctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.",
      "Kennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.",
      "Both he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.",
      "Last week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.",
      "Eileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she'd like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.",

She\u2019s aware that research has found no link between vaccines and autism, but she\u2019s still not convinced. Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.",
      "\u201cWhy did this happen to him?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years and years and years.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "A ban on disposable vapes has come into force across the U.K. as the British government aims to stem their illegal use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment",
      "LONDON -- A ban on disposable vapes came into force across the U.K. on Sunday as the British government aims to stem their use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment.",
      "The ban makes it illegal for any retailer \u2014 online or in-store \u2014 to sell vapes, whether they contain nicotine or not. They will still be able to sell reusable vapes.",
      "The crackdown follows the soaring use of disposable vapes in schools and a rising tide of trash as users dispose of the vapes. It is estimated that as many as 5 million disposable vapes are thrown in bins or littered every week across the U.K., rather than being recycled.",
      "A number of countries are seeking to regulate the vape market, which has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Australia outlawed the sale of vapes outside pharmacies last year in some of the world\u2019s toughest restrictions on electronic cigarettes, while Belgium became the first European Country to ban the use of disposable vapes at the start of this year. California has been at the forefront of bringing in new regulations in the U.S.",
      "The U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said usage among young people remained too high, and the ban would \u201cput an end to their alarming rise in school playgrounds and the avalanche of rubbish flooding the nation\u2019s streets.\u201d",
      "Also known as single-use vapes, disposable vapes are non-refillable and unable to be recharged, and are typically thrown away with general waste or just thrown on the street. Even when they are recycled, they need to be taken apart by hand, while their batteries are a fire risk to recycling facilities and can leak harmful chemicals into the environment and potentially harming wildlife.",
      "Businesses were given six months to prepare for the change by selling any existing stock. Rogue traders who continue to sell them risk a fine of 200 ($260) in the first instance, followed by an unlimited fine or jail time for repeat offending.",
      "The U.K. Vaping Industry Association said its members had moved quickly to comply with the June 1 deadline, but warned of \u201cserious unintended consequences\u201d emanating from too much regulation.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that this ban will encourage former smokers who have already transitioned from cigarettes, which kill 220 people every day in the U.K, to return to combustible tobacco or opt for unregulated vapes,\" said its director general, John Dunne.",
      "Separately, the British government is legislating to potentially restrict the packaging, marketing and flavors of e-cigarettes.",

      "ROME -- French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, best known as the inventor of the abortion pill, died on Friday aged 98 at his home in Paris, his institute said in a statement.",
      "Both a doctor and a researcher, Baulieu was known around the world for the scientific, medical and social significance of his work on steroid hormones.",
      "\u201cHis research was guided by his attachment to the progress made possible by science, his commitment to women\u2019s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,\u201d the Institut Baulieu said in the statement posted on its website.",
      "Born Etienne Blum in Strasbourg on Dec. 12, 1926, he took the name \u201c\u00c9mile Baulieu\u201d when he joined the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation at the age of 15.",
      "An endocrinologist with a doctorate in medicine completed in 1955 and one in science eight years later, in 1963 Baulieu founded a pioneering research unit working on hormones at INSERM, the French institute for health and medical research. He remained as head of the unit until 1997.",
      "He is best known for his development, in 1982, of RU 486, the so-called \u201cabortion pill\u201d that changed the lives of millions of women throughout the world, offering them the possibility of voluntary medical termination of pregnancy, in physical and psychological safety.",
      "The Institut Baulieu said it was \u201ca non-invasive method, less aggressive and less delayed than surgery,\u201d noting that following his discovery the researcher faced fierce criticism and even threats from opponents of women's abortion rights.",
      "\u201cEven today, access to this method is opposed, banned in some countries, and is currently being challenged in the United States, where it is the most widely used abortion method,\u201d the institute added.",
      "Baulieu\u2019s research into DHEA, a hormone whose secretion and anti-aging activity he had discovered, led him to work on neurosteroids -- or steroids of the nervous system. He also developed an original treatment to combat depression, for which a clinical trial is currently underway in several university hospitals.",
      "In 2008, he founded the Institut Baulieu to understand, prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.",
      "Honored with the grand crosses of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur (legion of honor) and the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (national order of merit), he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1982, which he chaired in 2003 and 2004.",
      "He was a member of the national advisory committee on life sciences and health (1996-2002) and received numerous awards, both in France and abroad.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Baulieu in a post on X, calling him \u201ca beacon of courage\u201d and \u201ca progressive mind who enabled women to win their freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cFew French people have changed the world to such an extent,\u201d he added.",
      "After the death of his first wife, Yolande Compagnon, he remarried, to Simone Harari Baulieu. He is survived by three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, his institute said.",

      "The attorneys filed a motion Friday to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit, but did not give a reason for seeking to drop the case. The lawsuit had been filed last year in state court in Louisville on behalf of a woman who was seven weeks pregnant at the time and identified only by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy.",

      "\u201cPeople have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,\u201d said Amber Duke, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cWe are strategizing our next steps in this fight.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities. The trigger law took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",

      "Americans are losing an array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee.",
      "State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big \u2014 and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities \u2014 are being hollowed out.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed.",
      "Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.",
      "The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That's one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.",
      "\"It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d",
      "Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.",
      "Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.",
      "\u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said.",
      "The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated.",
      "The Mecklenburg County department, with \"Protecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.",
      "\u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d",
      "What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.",
      "Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d",
      "State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.",
      "Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department's budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.",
      "At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening.",
      "\u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.",
      "A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.",
      "The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.",
      "A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d",
      "HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.",
      "In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.",
      "In Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.",
      "The cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d",
      "CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.",
      "So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.",
      "She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines.",
      "\u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.",
      "With health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California\u2019s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.",
      "But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation \u2014 some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County\u2019s health director. \u201cWhat really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. ... We were still pretty trim, but we weren\u2019t just, like, bones.\u201d",
      "In Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 \u2014 slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs.",
      "In Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu.",
      "The cuts are not over.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC\u2019s budget, enough to cut the agency\u2019s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities.",
      "Michael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States.",
      "\u201cWithout the appropriate funding, we can\u2019t properly address these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.\u201d",

      "The nation\u2019s top public health agency has posted new recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women may \u2014 but no longer should \u2014 get COVID-19 vaccinations",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get COVID-19 vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.",
      "The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "But the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt's not as bad as it could have been.\"",
      "Kennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.",
      "A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.",
      "\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\"",
      "That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.",
      "Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "A CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.",
      "But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.",
      "The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \"incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.",

      "Carlos Alcaraz has been wearing nasal strips in some matches since last season",
      "PARIS -- If more tennis players find themselves breathing easier, it might just be thanks to Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "The four-time Grand Slam champion, whose bid for a second consecutive French Open title was scheduled to continue with a third-round match Friday night, has often worn a nasal strip in matches since last season \u2014 although not during his first two contests at Roland-Garros this week \u2014 and the sport's other athletes took note.",
      "After all, if Alcaraz finds something useful on the court, their thinking goes, maybe it makes sense to give the adhesive bands a shot.",
      "\u201cI saw Carlos playing in it,\u201d said 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, a semifinalist in Paris last year and the No. 6 women's seed this time. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty interested to try and see if there is really a difference. If he plays matches in it, then probably there is.\u201d",
      "At the 2024 season-ending ATP Finals last November, Alcaraz said: \u201cIt is something that I\u2019m going to wear more often. I could recover better between points.\u201d",
      "Once associated with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, the bands, which essentially look like a Band-Aid worn across the bridge of the nose, are popping up on tennis courts \u2014 sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of curiosity.",
      "They are designed to open the nostrils slightly, making it easier to breathe through the nose. Originally marketed to reduce snoring, they\u2019re being embraced to enhance air intake during physical exertion.",
      "The idea is simple: Better breathing could mean better oxygen intake.",
      "In practice, the science is less convincing.",
      "In 2021, Brazilian academic Ricardo Dinardi reviewed more than 600 studies on nasal strips and found they didn\u2019t make a real difference in how much air athletes took in, their heart rate or how strenuous exercise felt.",
      "\u201cThe effect on athletic performance is mostly placebo,\u201d Dinardi said. \u201cBut in elite sports, even perceived benefits can count.\u201d",
      "Three-time major finalist Casper Ruud, who wore the strips in matches earlier this year, knows the evidence is shaky. But he still liked using them \u2014 both on the court and while sleeping. Like Alcaraz, Ruud did not wear one in Paris before his second-round exit.",
      "But he has been testing a prototype of a different version.",
      "\u201cI tried out a device that\u2019s very early in development. It will be a bit more comfortable to wear, because it\u2019s inside the nose and it looks like I have this bullring under,\u201d said Ruud, who was the runner-up at Roland-Garros to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023. \u201cIt will return, don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
      "For other players, like Nicol\u00e1s Jarry, the strips are more than a trend \u2014 they\u2019re a necessity. After nasal surgery in 2020, the Chilean still needed help to draw air into his nose, so he puts them on for every practice and every match he plays.",
      "\u201cWithout it, I cannot breathe. My nostrils shut when I try,\u201d he said, inhaling to demonstrate for a reporter. \u201cOthers don\u2019t have that issue and still use them.\u201d",
      "Jarry definitely has noticed a recent spike in interest among players. He said that even though he's worn the strips for years, including at this French Open, other competitors on tour never asked about them \u2014 until Alcaraz started wearing one last year, sometimes in black, sometimes in pink.",
      "\u201cOthers have asked me, and many are trying it,\" said Jarry, who sported a beige-colored strip in Paris. \"But before him? Nothing.\u201d",
      "There are those, like 2024 US Open runner-up Jessica Pegula, who are tempted to try.",
      "\u201cI have a horrible deviated septum. I can\u2019t really breathe out of one side of my nose,\" said Pegula, who will play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round Saturday. \u201cMaybe I should start wearing one.\u201d",
      "She admits, though, that the aesthetic aspect might be a deal-breaker.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" Pegula said with a smile, \u201cif I have the confidence to rock one.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was a longtime anti-vaccine activist, said this week that the shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, usurping a decision normally made by scientific experts, not political appointees.",
      "The announcement follows an earlier Trump administration step to limit COVID-19 vaccinations among healthy people under age 65.",
      "Until now, the U.S. \u2013 following guidance from independent experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 has recommended yearly COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.",
      "Together, the moves have left health experts, vaccine makers and insurers uncertain about what to advise and what comes next.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to add a lot of confusion overall,\u201d said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.",
      "Some of this season\u2019s vaccine is still available. Insurance industry experts say if people had insurance coverage before Kennedy\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s highly unlikely that would have ended instantly based on the secretary\u2019s video announcement. That means if someone could find a shot, they'd likely be able to get one for now.",
      "Who will be able to get what vaccines this fall is still unclear.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers plan to issue updated COVID-19 shots in the late summer or fall. But the Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to limit approval of seasonal shots to seniors and others at high risk, pending more studies of everyone else.",
      "Even if the U.S. approves vaccines only for certain groups, it still may be possible for others to get the shot depending on the outcome of upcoming advisory meetings, regulatory moves and decisions from insurers and employers.",
      "Insurers base coverage decisions on the recommendations of that CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It\u2019s not clear what role that panel now will play. Paying out of pocket could cost about $200.",
      "But some insurers and employers may decide to still cover the shots regardless of the new recommendations, said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the non-profit KFF, which studies health care issues. She noted that they may view the expense as worthwhile if it avoids a higher bill from someone hospitalized by the coronavirus.",
      "The FDA published a list of health conditions it said would qualify, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. The CDC has a more extensive list.",
      "But, again, it isn't yet known how this will play out. For example, it could be hard for people to prove they're qualified. If they're vaccinated at a drugstore, for instance, the pharmacist wouldn't normally know about underlying health problems or even ask. Kates said it's unclear whether Kennedy's move would affect whether doctors recommend the shot.",
      "And Sethi, the UW-Madison expert, said \u201cthis elephant in the room\u201d is that blocking vaccination to the healthy may mean people who have a risk factor and simply don't know it will miss out.",
      "Adding to the confusion, the FDA included pregnancy and recent pregnancy on the list of conditions that would qualify someone for a shot \u2014 but Kennedy said that pregnancy was no longer a qualification in his announcement this week.",
      "COVID-19 complications during pregnancy can include preterm birth as well as serious illness in the mother, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said it \u201cstrongly reaffirms\u201d its recommendation for vaccination during pregnancy.",

      "A verdict is expected in one of France's largest-ever child sex abuse cases",
      "A French court will deliver its verdict Wednesday in one of the country\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse cases, which has raised questions about how a pedophile surgeon was able to rape hundreds of victims over a period spanning more than two decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, a 74-year-old former surgeon, stands accused of raping and sexually assaulting 299 children. On Friday, prosecutors requested the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, describing Le Scouarnec as \u201ca devil in a white coat.\u201d He's already serving a 15-year prison sentence, for a conviction in 2020 for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces.",
      "The new trial in Brittany, western France, began in February and has laid bare a pattern of abuse between 1989 and 2014. Most of the victims were unconscious or sedated hospital patients at the time of the assaults. The average age was 11. Among the victims were 158 boys and 141 girls.",
      "During the trial, advocacy groups have accused health authorities of inaction after they were notified as soon as 2005 of Le Scouarnec\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography pictures.",
      "At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.",
      "\u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments.",
      "\u201cMore could have been done,\" Kellenberger said. \"Things could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.",
      "Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial came as activists continue to push to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to three to 20 years in prison.",
      "In a separate case focusing on alleged abuse at a Catholic school, an inquiry commission of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse over five decades.",
      "Victims of Le Scouarnec have, however, complained of a perceived lack of attention.",
      "\"This trial, which could have served as an open-air laboratory to expose the serious failings of our institutions, seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large,\u201d a group of victims said in a statement.",
      "Not all victims were initially aware they had been abused. Some were contacted by investigators after their names appeared in journals kept by Le Scouarnec, in which he meticulously documented his crimes. Others only realized they had been hospitalized at the time after checking medical records. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial.",
      "Using the cover of medical procedures, the former abdominal and digestive surgeon took advantage of moments when children were alone in their hospital rooms. His method was to disguise sexual abuse as clinical care, targeting young patients who were unlikely to remember the encounters.",
      "The notebooks, which detail the abuse in graphic language, have become central to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "Despite the scope of the allegations, Le Scouarnec has remained calm and composed throughout the trial.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them as people,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were the destination of my fantasies. As the trial went on, I began to see them as individuals, with emotions, anger, suffering and distress.\u201d",
      "He said his first act of abuse occurred in 1985, when he raped his 5-year-old niece.",
      "While he offered apologies to some victims, his demeanor struck many as detached and emotionless.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t show emotion, that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it, but I don\u2019t express it.\u201d",
      "The case first came to light in April 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor told her mother that the man next door had exposed himself and touched her through the fence separating their properties.",
      "A search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions.",
      "\u201cJo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec says he no longer feels any sexual attraction to children, but there\u2019s no way to verify that,\u201d Kellenberger, the prosecutor, told the court. \u201cExperts concluded that we cannot rely on his word alone and that his potential for future danger remains significant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are seeking not only a 20-year prison sentence with a two-thirds minimum term, but also a post-sentence preventive detention, a rarely used measure in France that applies to the country\u2019s most dangerous offenders. If approved, Le Scouarnec could be held indefinitely in a secure socio-medical facility, even after serving his time.",
      "A third trial is expected in the coming years, following the emergence of new allegations during this trial, including further abuse involving his granddaughter.",

      "Merzouk's family and lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the announcement.",
      "The teenager was shot during a traffic stop in Nanterre. Video showed two officers at the window of the Mercedes the youth was driving, one with his gun pointed at Merzouk. As the car pulled forward, the officer fired once.",

      "Protests over his killing spread around France and some turned violent, with s tores looted and public buildings torched. Thousands of people were arrested as the government ratcheted up its law enforcement response to quell the unrest, and hundreds of people were injured. In related protests in the overseas territory of French Guiana in South America, a 54-year-old died after being hit by a stray bullet.",
      "The reaction to the killing was a potent reminder of the persistent poverty, discrimination, unemployment and other lack of opportunity in neighborhoods around France where many residents trace their roots to former French colonies.",

      "BEIRUT -- Iran\u2019s foreign minister said Tehran supports Lebanon\u2019s efforts to pressure Israel to end its military presence in parts of the country, including diplomatic moves \u201cto expel the occupiers.\u201d",
      "Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi added on Tuesday that Iran looks forward to relations with Lebanon based on mutual respect under the new circumstances in the country following the Israel-Hezbollah war.",
      "Araghchi\u2019s visit comes after Iran\u2019s main Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, was weakened by the 14-month war with Israel that left much of the Iran-backed group\u2019s political and military leadership dead.",
      "Araghchi\u2019s visit is his first since October, which came at the height of the Israel-Hezbollah war that ended a month later with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. The war killed more than 4,000 in Lebanon, displaced over 1 million people and caused destruction that the World Bank said will coast $11 billion in reconstruction.",
      "Since the war ended, army commander Joseph Aoun was elected president and prominent jurist and diplomat Nawaf Salam became the country\u2019s prime minister. Both Aoun and Salam have repeatedly said that only the state will monopolize the use of weapons in Lebanon.",
      "The visit also comes after the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad was removed from power in December by insurgent group\u2019s opposed to Iran\u2019s influence in the region. Assad was one of Tehran\u2019s closest allies in the Arab world and his country was a main link for the flow of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah.",
      "Aoun told the visiting Iranian official during their meeting that Beirut wants \u201cto strengthen relations from state to state with Iran.\u201d Aoun\u2019s comments were released by his office.",
      "Over the past decades, Iran funded Hezbollah with billions of dollars and sent all types of weapons to the Lebanese group enjoying wide influence in the small Mediterranean nation through.",
      "Since the Israel-Hezbollah war ended, Lebanese authorities have taken tight measures at Beirut\u2019s airport to prevent the flow of funds from Iran to Hezbollah and flights by Iranian companies have been suspended to Beirut.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to having relations (with Lebanon) based on mutual respect and non-interference in each country\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d Araghchi told reporters after meeting Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. He added that Iran backs a national dialogue in Lebanon between rival groups.",
      "Iran condemns the occupation of Lebanese territories \u201cby the Zionist entity and supports all efforts exerted by the Lebanese government and people to expel the occupiers through any way including diplomatic methods,\" Araghchi said, referring to five posts Israel refused to withdraw from earlier this year.",
      "Iranian companies are ready to take part in Lebanon\u2019s reconstruction if the Lebanese government wants that, Araghchi said.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Araghchi held talks with his Lebanese counterpart, Youssef Rajji, and discussed Iran\u2019s ongoing negotiations with the United States over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Appeals judges at the International Criminal Court gave a final greenlight Tuesday for the tribunal\u2019s first in absentia hearing by allowing the next step in proceedings against notorious fugitive Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony.",
      "The Hague-based court has scheduled a so-called confirmation of charges hearing at which prosecutors will present evidence in September to back up charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity against Kony, despite his whereabouts being unknown.",
      "Kony, the leader of the brutal Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, faces dozens of counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, sexual enslavement and rape.",
      "The ICC's rules do not allow trials entirely in absentia but can in some circumstances move forward with a confirmation of charges even if the suspect is not in custody.",
      "Kony\u2019s court appointed lawyers had argued his fair trial rights would be violated if the proceedings continued without their client.",
      "Judge Erdenebalsuren Damdin said the court has \u201cadequately robust safeguards\u201d for suspects to allow the confirmation of charges hearing to be held in absentia.",
      "The case had been seen as a trial balloon for the court moving forward with other cases where the suspect is not in custody, such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "However, the Kony decision was limited to situations where the wanted person has fled ICC custody or cannot be found, says Luigi Prosperi, an international criminal law expert at the University of Utrecht. Kony \u201cis a very peculiar situation,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "Kony was thrust into the global spotlight in 2012 when a video about his alleged crimes went viral. Despite the attention and international efforts to capture him, he is still at large.",
      "The LRA began its attacks in Uganda in the 1980s, when Kony sought to overthrow the government. After being pushed out of Uganda, the militia terrorized villages in Congo, Central African Republic and South Sudan. It was notorious for using child soldiers, mutilating civilians and enslaving women.",
      "In 2021, the court convicted Dominic Ongwen, a one-time child soldier who morphed into a brutal LRA commander of dozens of war crimes and crimes against humanity, ranging from multiple murders to forced marriages.",

      "Resource-rich Mongolia is facing political uncertainty following the resignation of its prime minister in the wake of protests over endemic corruption in the landlocked Asian country, squeezed between China and Russia",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Resource-rich Mongolia is facing political uncertainty following the resignation early on Tuesday of its prime minister in the wake of protests over endemic corruption in the landlocked Asian country, squeezed between China and Russia.",
      "Before he lost the confidence vote in the parliament, Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai warned that his removal could undermine Mongolia\u2019s fledgling democracy. The vote followed weeks of protests sparked by reports of lavish spending by his son and calls for him to step down.",
      "The reports, which cited expensive jewelry and helicopter rides for the son's female companion, underscored the vast gap between Mongolians who have grown extremely wealthy off the country's exports and much of the rest of the population, mired in poverty.",
      "Here is a look at why what is happening in Mongolia matters:",
      "Mongolia, a country of about 3.5 million people, borders Russia to the north and China to the south. Its stunning alpine mountains interspersed with vast deserts hold an abundance of coal, copper and other natural resources used in high-tech manufacturing.",
      "The question of who benefits from the wealth has been a key issue since Mongolia began negotiating with foreign mining giants \u2014 rumors of secret deals and under-the-table payments have circulated for years.",
      "After Mongolia threw off Communism at the end of the Cold War, it lost generous Soviet Union aid packages. Since then, it has been slowly becoming a democracy but is struggling to avoid falling into debt while holding Chinese and Russian interests at bay.",
      "China is a particularly important neighbor as its ruling Communist Party buys up 92% of Mongolia\u2019s exports.",
      "Over the years, the capital of Ulaanbaataar transformed itself from a city of clunky Soviet-era buildings surrounded by traditional herders' felt tents known as gers, into a metropolis of shopping malls and fancy hotels.",
      "The protesters have said the country\u2019s mineral riches have benefited business interests and the wealthy, while many Mongolians still live in poverty.",
      "Early on Tuesday morning, Oyun-Erdene only got 44 votes of support in the 126-seat legislature \u2014 the State Great Khural \u2014 well short of the 64 needed, according to the head of the counting commission, M. Narantuya-nara.",
      "Oyun-Erdene accepted defeat, saying it had been an honor to serve the nation through the coronavirus pandemic, Russia's war on Ukraine and the ongoing strife over U.S. tariffs.",
      "But he also warned of the threat of a \u201cspider\u2019s web\u201d of special interests that he said are working to hold the Mongolian people back.",
      "Oyun-Erdene, who ran a coalition government, will remain prime minister until his replacement is elected in parliament, most likely from the ranks of opposition lawmakers.",
      "Those who pick his successor will likely also have to find a platform that will satisfy the demands of the largely young and well-educated class that has led the protests. That could include moving ahead with a national sovereignty fund introduced recently to better help spread the wealth.",
      "In stepping down, Oyun-Erdene defended his integrity but said he had made the mistake of \u201cpaying insufficient attention to social and internal political matters.\u201d",
      "He also warned of political instability ahead, saying it \"could lead the public to lose faith in parliamentary rule and potentially put our democratic parliamentary system at risk of collapse.\u201d",
      "Erin Murphy, deputy director and senior fellow of India and emerging Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it's not easy to \"build that foundation for democracy\u201d at a time when Mongolia also must tackle economic problems.",
      "Julian Dierkes, a Mongolia expert at the University of Mannheim in Germany, said he doesn\u2019t expect any major policy changes, whoever becomes the next prime minister.",
      "\u201cThey will be selected on the basis of personal networks and patronage,\u201d Dierkes said.",
      "Many people on the street seemed worried for the future and some defended the outgoing prime minister on Tuesday.",
      "Oyun-Erdene should not be responsible for his son's failings, said Gansukh Batbayar, a military retiree in Ulaanbaatar who lauded what he described as Oyun-Erdene's efforts to \u201cconfiscate illegally earned assets and money of corrupt officials\u201d and distribute it more fairly.",
      "\u201cWe barely survive in these chaotic times and our pensions are very small,\u201d said an older woman on a public bus in Ulaanbaataar, who declined to give her name to speak about the political developments.",
      "She counts on her children \"to have food to eat and a roof over my head,\u201d she said.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- An Australian woman accused of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives with poisonous mushrooms told a court on Tuesday she accepted that the fatal lunch she served contained death caps.",
      "But Erin Patterson said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the fungi came from local stores. She denies three counts of murder and one of attempted murder over the beef Wellington meal she served to her parents-in-law and her estranged husband\u2019s aunt and uncle at her home in July 2023.",
      "Don Patterson, Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson were hospitalized and died after the lunch in the rural town of Leongatha in the Australian state of Victoria. Heather\u2019s husband, Ian Wilkinson, was gravely ill but survived.",
      "Patterson\u2019s lawyer earlier told the Supreme Court trial that the poisoning was a tragic accident but prosecutors said it was deliberate. If convicted, she faces a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder charges and 25 years in jail for attempted murder.",
      "Long queues formed outside the Latrobe Valley Courthouse on Tuesday after Patterson took the stand late Monday, which was the first time she had spoken publicly since the deaths.",
      "During several hours of evidence on Tuesday, Patterson, 50, told the court she began foraging fungi during the COVID-19 lockdown of March 2020, witnessed only by her children.",
      "\u201cI cut a bit of one of the mushrooms, fried it up with some butter and ate it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tasted good and I didn\u2019t get sick.\u201d",
      "Patterson said she also fed foraged mushrooms to her children, chopped up \u201cvery, very small\" so they couldn\u2019t pick them out of curries, pasta and soups.",
      "She developed a taste for exotic varieties, joined a \u201cmushroom lovers\u201d Facebook group, and bought a dehydrator to preserve her finds, Patterson said. Her lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, asked if she accepted that the beef Wellington pastries she had served to her lunch guests in 2023 contained death caps.",
      "\u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Patterson.",
      "The accused told her lawyer most of the mushrooms she used that day came from local supermarkets. She agreed she might have put them in the same container as dehydrated wild mushrooms she had foraged weeks earlier and others from an Asian food store.",
      "Mandy in April told the court his client had lied when she initially told investigators that she had never foraged before. But he denied that she had deliberately sought out death cap mushrooms and said she disposed of her dehydrator in a panic about the accidental deaths.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Patterson became tearful when she was asked about expletive-filled messages she had sent about her in-laws in December 2022 in a Facebook group chat that she described as a \u201csafe venting space\u201d for a group of women.",
      "\u201cI wish I\u2019d never said it. I feel very ashamed for saying it and I wish that the family didn\u2019t have to hear that I said it,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d",

      "The couple formally separated in 2015 after earlier temporary splits, the court has heard. Simon Patterson was invited to the July 2023 lunch but did not attend.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s evidence also traversed Patterson\u2019s health after prosecutors' suggestions that her lunch invitation was unusual and that she'd organized it on a false pretense of receiving a cancer diagnosis. The mother of two admitted she never had cancer, but had been worried enough by symptoms to seek tests.",
      "Despite her separation from Simon, Patterson said she had hoped to reunite with her estranged husband and said she had remained close to her in-laws.",
      "\u201cIt never changed. I was just their daughter in law,\u201d said Patterson, through tears. \u201cThey just continued to love me.\u201d",

Heather Wilkinson said shortly before she died that Patterson ate her individual beef wellington pastry from a different colored plate to the other diners, said prosecutor Nanette Rogers.",
      "Opening her case in April, Rogers said the poisoning was deliberate but that her case would not suggest a motive for the alleged killings. The prosecution says Patterson lied when she told investigators she had eaten the same meal as her guests and fed her children the leftovers.",

      "Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California, has devoted time to environmental causes since leaving political office in 2011.",
      "He said Tuesday he keeps hearing from environmentalists and policy experts lately who ask, \u201cWhat is the point of fighting for a clean environment when the government of the United States says climate change is a hoax and coal and oil is the future?\u201d",
      "Schwarzenegger told the Austrian World Summit in Vienna, an event he helps organize, that he responds: \u201cStop whining and get to work.\u201d",
      "He pointed to examples of local and regional governments and companies taking action, including his own administration in California, and argued 70% of pollution is reduced at the local or state level.",
      "\u201cBe the mayor that makes buses electric; be the CEO who ends fossil fuel dependence; be the school that puts (up) solar roofs,\" he said.",
      "\u201cYou can't just sit around and make excuses because one guy in a very nice White House on Pennsylvania Avenue doesn't agree with you,\u201d he said, adding that attacking the president is \u201cnot my style\u201d and he doesn't criticize any president when outside the U.S.",
      "\u201cI know that the people are sick and tired of the whining and the complaining and the doom and gloom,\u201d Schwarzenegger said. \u201cThe only way we win the people's hearts and minds is by showing them action that makes their lives better.\u201d",

      "Preliminary vote tallies from Mexico's first judicial elections indicate the ruling Morena party is headed toward control over the Supreme Court",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s ruling Morena party appeared to be heading toward control over the Supreme Court, preliminary vote tallies of the country's first judicial election indicated.",
      "While votes were still being counted for the majority of the 2,600 federal, state and local judge positions up for grabs in Sunday\u2019s judicial elections, results rolled in for the nine Supreme Court positions.",
      "The majority of the newly elected justices share strong ties and ideological alignments with the ruling party, shifting a once fairly balanced high court into the hands of the very party that overhauled the judicial system to elect judges for the first time.",
      "Experts warned the shift would undercut checks and balances in the Latin American nation: The governing party would now be close to controlling all three branches of government, and President Claudia Sheinbaum and her party also would have a easier path to push through their agenda.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re watching as power is falling almost entirely into the hands of one party,\u201d said Georgina De la Fuente, election specialist with the Mexican consulting firm Strategia Electoral. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any balance of power.\u201d",
      "Some of those headed toward election were members or former members of the party. A number of them, who were Supreme Court justices prior to the election, were appointed by former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum\u2019s mentor who pushed through the judicial overhaul last year.",
      "Others were advisers to the president or the party or campaigned with politically aligned visions for the judiciary.",
      "Not all of the prospective winners were explicitly aligned with Morena. One standout was Hugo Aguilar Ortiz, an Indigenous lawyer from the southern state of Oaxaca. He has no clear party affiliation, though Sheinbaum said repeatedly she hoped to have an Indigenous judge on the court.",
      "That Morena would emerge from the election with control of the judiciary was what critics had feared.",
      "The vote came after months of fierce debate, prompted when L\u00f3pez Obrador and the party jammed through the reforms for judges to be elected instead of being appointed based on merits. The overhaul will notably limit the Supreme Court as a counterweight to the president.",
      "Critics say the judicial reform was an attempt to take advantage of high popularity levels to stack courts in favor of the party. Sheinbaum and her mentor have insisted that electing judges will root out corruption in a system most Mexicans agree is broken.",
      "\u201cWhoever says that there is authoritarianism in Mexico is lying,\u201d Sheinbaum said during the vote. \u201cMexico is a country that is only becoming more free, just and democratic because that is the will of the people.\u201d",
      "The elections were marred by low participation \u2014 about 13% \u2014 and confusion by voters who struggled to understand the new voting system, something opponents quickly latched onto as a failure.",
      "De la Fuente said Morena is likely to use its new lack of counterweight in the high court to push through rounds of reforms, including electoral changes.",
      "Late Monday, more than 85% of the ballots had been tallied and counting was to continue overnight.",
      "\u2014 Hugo Aguilar Ortiz was the big surprise from the election. The Indigenous lawyer led all vote-getters, including several sitting Supreme Court justices. He\u2019s known as a legal activist fighting for the rights of Indigenous Mexicans and has criticized corruption in the judiciary.",
      "\u2014 Lenia Batres was already a Supreme Court justice and was appointed by L\u00f3pez Obrador. Previously a congresswoman, she\u2019s a member of Morena and clearly an ally of Mexico\u2019s president.",
      "\u2014 Yasm\u00edn Esquivel is a Supreme Court justice who was appointed by L\u00f3pez Obrador. She focused her campaign on modernizing the justice system and has pushed for gender equality. She was at the center of a 2022 controversy when she was accused of plagiarizing her thesis. She is considered an ally of the Morena party.",
      "\u2014 Loretta Ortiz is a justice on the Supreme Court who was appointed by L\u00f3pez Obrador. She also served in Congress and resigned from Morena in 2018 in a show of independence as a judge. Despite that, she\u2019s considered an ally of the party.",
      "\u2014 Mar\u00eda Estela R\u00edos Gonz\u00e1lez is a lawyer who acted as legal adviser to L\u00f3pez Obrador, first when he was mayor of Mexico City and later when he became president. She has a long history as a public servant and work in labor law and on a number of Indigenous issues.",
      "\u2014 Giovanni Figueroa Mej\u00eda is a lawyer from the Pacific coast state of Nayarit with a doctorate in constitutional law. He currently works as an academic at the Iberoamericana University in Mexico City. He\u2019s worked in human rights. While he holds no clear party affiliation, he supported the judicial overhaul pushed forward by Morena, saying in an interview with his university that the overhaul \u201cwas urgent and necessary in order to rebuild\u201d the judiciary. He said some of his work in constitutional law was cited in justifying the reform.",
      "\u2014 Irving Espinosa Betanzo is a magistrate on Mexico City\u2019s Supreme Court and has previously worked as a congressional adviser to Morena. He campaigned for the country's highest court on a platform of eliminating nepotism and corruption and pushing for human rights.",

      "\u201cEverything was on fire,\u201d she said in an interview at the hospital in the border town of Akobo where she was being treated for her injuries.",
      "The bombing happened on May 3 at another hospital in the northern community of Fangak where she had traveled to be with her 25-year-old son while he sought treatment for tuberculosis. A series of strikes there, including several at the Doctors Without Borders facility, killed seven people.",
      "\u201cI ran outside and started rubbing mud on myself to stop the burning,\u201d Makuach said.",
      "Makuach, 60, is just one of the dozens of civilians who aid groups say have been killed or badly injured by airstrikes in recent weeks as South Sudan\u2019s army clashes with militia groups across the country. The army says it targets only combatants, and has not commented on civilian casualties.",
      "\u201cThe army displaced us and our families into the bush and that\u2019s when we decided we would fight back,\u201d said Gatkuoth Wie, 24, who was wounded while fighting in northern Jonglei State.",
      "The fighting has led to U.N. warnings that South Sudan is again on the brink of civil war. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to send to South Sudan a group of eight deportees from Cuba, Vietnam and elsewhere who have been convicted in the U.S. of serious crimes, sparking a legal fight that has reached the Supreme Court.",
      "Many of those wounded in the South Sudan clashes have been transported to Akobo, where the International Committee for the Red Cross has set up a temporary surgical response. Others have been stranded for days by the fighting.",
      "Doctor Bjarte Andersen, a surgeon working with the ICRC, says that the fighting has made it difficult to transport patients that have been critically wounded. \u201cWe know of one person who has died waiting for transportation, but there are probably more,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe most critical cases cannot even be moved, they are not likely to survive the journey,\u201d said Christina Bartulec, who oversees the organization\u2019s medical operation in Akobo.",
      "The ICRC does not track which patients are combatants and which are civilians. Most of the people brought to their facility are young men, several of whom told The Associated Press that they were engaged in fighting.",
      "In the past month, however, an increasing number of the victims have been women and a few children, according to hospital staff.",
      "One is Kuaynin Bol, 15, who was gravely injured by a blast as he lay asleep in his home. Surgeons have removed bone fragments from his brain and performed four operations on his leg, which was badly broken.",
      "Simmering tensions between the government and opposition groups erupted in March when a local militia called the White Army overran a military barracks in Nasir, a town in the country\u2019s northeast.",
      "The government pinned responsibility for the attack on First Vice President Riek Machar, placing him under house arrest and detaining other members of his SPLM-IO party. It also brought in Ugandan forces to support a sweeping military offensive against opposition troops and community militias across the country.",
      "That offensive centered on Upper Nile State and allegedly involved use of improvised incendiary weapons that Human Rights Watch has said killed at least 58 people, including children.",
      "In May, the fighting spread to northern Jonglei State where Fangak is located, a region previously unaffected by the violence, after the government alleged several barges were hijacked by opposition forces there.",
      "Isaac Pariel, a member of Machar's opposition party who is the local chairman in Fangak of the government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, said that at least 25 civilians have been killed this month.

      "Bulgaria is close to realizing its decades-old goal of joining the euro currency union",
      "SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria is close to realizing its decades-old goal of joining the euro currency union and deepening ties with the more prosperous countries of Western Europe. But the government faces a populist backlash against the shared currency on the eve of a key decision by European Union authorities.",
      "Fears of inflation, poverty and the unknown are mingling with disinformation spread on social media that aims to turn people against the euro. The discontent tracks with increased support for populist and anti-EU parties across Europe, which is exploited by nationalist and pro-Russian politicians in a country that remains one of Europe's poorest and most afflicted with corruption.",
      "\u201cAdopting the euro will make us feel the threshold of poverty. After all, prices will be in euros,\u201d said 78-year-old retiree Tanya Ignatova.",
      "\u201cBulgaria is not ready for the euro. Someday we may be ready, but not now,\" said another retiree, Mario Georgiev.",
      "Several thousand people rallied against the euro in the capital on Saturday, urging a referendum on whether to transition from the lev currency to the euro. The head of the pro-Russian Varazhdane party, Kostadin Kostadinov, told the crowd that \u201cBulgaria has risen and declared: Freedom, we choose the Bulgarian lev!\u201d",
      "Others in Bulgaria say the country already benefits from EU membership and it does not matter what the currency is. \"We have inflation now and we will have it in the future,\u201d said 26-year-old Konstantin Bozhinov.",
      "Aiming at deepening European integration amid growing geopolitical tensions, the government is pressing ahead. It has asked for a review of whether it meets the requirements of low inflation, sound government finances and legal conformity to EU institutions. On Wednesday, the European Commission will announce the results.",
      "If the commission gives a green light, other member states will decide on Bulgaria's candidacy in the coming weeks.",
      "At the last review in 2022, Bulgaria failed on the inflation requirement. Inflation has since fallen.",
      "President Rumen Radev has encouraged the anti-euro voices by proposing a referendum on the currency, citing public concerns over inflation and purchasing power. That followed a protest in February that saw the offices of the EU's executive commission in Sofia spattered with red paint and its entrance set on fire.",
      "The president's proposal was turned down by the pro-European majority in parliament, which accused Radev of acting in favor of Russia with his last-minute attempt to sabotage the euro adoption.",
      "According to the EU\u2019s multi-country Eurobarometer survey released last week, 50% of Bulgarians are against the adoption of the euro, while 43% are in favor. In contrast, trust in the euro continues to grow across the rest of the EU.",
      "Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. It has been plagued by political instability and corruption that have fueled euroscepticism among its 6.4 million citizens. Analysts say disinformation campaigns from abroad have fed fears of economic changes that could bring more poverty.",
      "Scores of false claims by opponents of the eurozone have been published on social networks. One claim says the EU plans to take away people\u2019s savings if they fail to spend them within a certain period. Another claims that plans to introduce a digital version of the euro are part of a plan to control everyone.",
      "\u201cThere is a powerful brainwashing of the average Bulgarian. Illusory fears are being spread, lies are being told wholesale, unscrupulously and brazenly,\" said Ognyan Minchev, director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies in Sofia.",
      "Economists say joining the euro will not bring massive change to Bulgaria's economy in the short run. That's because the government has pegged the currency to the euro by law, at a fixed rate of 1 lev for every 51 euro cents.",
      "Joining the euro can bring lower borrowing costs, greater ease in comparing domestic and foreign prices and no need to exchange money when vacationing in another euro country. More than that, it\u2019s a sign of integration into the EU and its large economy. Members get a seat on the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate-setting committee.",
      "Countries agree to join the euro when they join the EU, but so far 20 of 27 members have taken the step. Croatia was the last to join in 2023.",
      "Bulgaria's government has very little debt, at 24.1% of GDP \u2014 the second lowest in the EU and well below the 60% level in euro membership criteria. That's a sharp contrast to its neighbor, Greece, which entered the euro in 1999 with high debt that was concealed through complex financial transactions. Greece's broken finances eventually triggered a eurozone-wide crisis.",
      "Bulgaria's government has been \u201cfiscally super conservative ... the risk of Bulgaria becoming a fiscal risk to the eurozone is essentially zero,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.",
      "Fears of inflation are not entirely without basis. Experience in other countries shows that \u201cwhenever there is a changeover from national currency to the euro, there is often a minor inflation effect, but it's typically less than 1%,\u201d said Darvas",
      "Economists say a one-time increase occurs as service providers such as restaurants, which don't adjust prices as often as other sectors, take advantage of re-doing menus and price lists to implement hikes.",

      "Guatemalan prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche, who himself has been sanctioned by the United States and other countries for allegedly interfering in corruption investigations, had requested that an appeals court issue the arrest orders for Colombia\u2019s top prosecutor Luz Adriana Camargo Garz\u00f3n, who was the chief of investigations of the Guatemala mission, and Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, who had led the mission and later was Colombia\u2019s defense minister.",
      "Curruchiche said Camargo and Vel\u00e1squez had committed illicit association during their investigation into bribes paid to Guatemalan officials by Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.",
      "Along with former Guatemalan prosecutors working with the U.N. mission, Vel\u00e1squez and Camargo were part of \u201ca criminal structure led by the former CICIG commissioner,\u201d using the Spanish initials of the U.N. mission, Curruchiche alleged.",
      "Curruchiche had long ago focused his investigation on an agreement the anti-corruption prosecutors had signed with Odebrecht that would offer reduced penalties in exchange for the company\u2019s cooperation in the investigation. His boss, Prosecutor General Consuelo Porras, has also been sanctioned by the U.S. and other governments for blocking corruption investigations. Last week, a U.N. expert warned her office was using criminal law to pursue enemies.",
      "Vel\u00e1squez responded via X after learning of the accusations.",
      "\u201cSo now the corrupt Guatemalan attorney general and her prosecutor Curruchiche \u2013 designated as corrupt and sanctioned by the United States and the European Union \u2013 extend their persecution for Luz Adriana Camargo and me,\u201d Vel\u00e1squez wrote. \u201cMy solidarity with the former officials and so many Guatemalan citizens who the Attorney General\u2019s Office has forced into exile.\u201d",
      "Camargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Among those former Guatemalan prosecutors forced into exile was Juan Francisco Sandoval, who led the special prosecutor\u2019s office against impunity.",
      "Sandoval, who led the Odebrecht investigation with support from the U.N. mission and has been living in exile in the United States, said last month in a statement that Curruchiche\u2019s investigation was \u201ca sham and a manipulation strategy.\u201d",
      "The U.N. mission operated in Guatemala from 2007 to 2019, when then-President Jimmy Morales decided to not renew its mandate, after it linked members of his family to a case.",
      "It had worked with Guatemalan prosecutors to take down criminal structures in the country, sending judges, prosecutors, other public officials, including former presidents to trial for corruption.",

      "Turkish authorities say a 5.8-magnitude earthquake shook the Mediterranean coastal town of Marmaris, causing panic among residents",
      "ANKARA, Turkey -- A magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook a coastal town in Turkey on Tuesday, causing panic among residents, officials said. Dozens were reported injured after jumping from windows or balconies to get out of their homes while a teenager died after being taken to the hospital.",
      "No major damage was reported.",
      "The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency said the quake hit at 2:17 a.m. and was centered in the Mediterranean Sea, off the holiday resort of Marmaris. It was felt in neighboring regions, including on the Greek island of Rhodes, waking many from their sleep.",
      "Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X that a 14-year-old girl was taken to hospital and died there after what he said was an anxiety attack. It was not known if she had any underlying conditions.",
      "Nearly 70 other people were treated for injuries after jumping from windows or balconies in panic, he said. There were no reports of damage to buildings, he added.",
      "On Rhodes, tourists and residents spent hours overnight outside their hotels and homes after feeling the temblor but island officials said the damage was minor.",
      "That's likely because the quake struck at a depth of 60 kilometers (37 miles), according to Efthymios Lekkas, head of Greece\u2019s Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization.",
      "\"Although it was felt in a wider area ... it will not have significant impact on the surface,\u201d Lekkas told state-run television.",
      "Turkey sits on top of major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent.",
      "In 2023, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake killed more than 53,000 people in Turkey and destroyed or damaged hundreds of thousands of buildings in 11 southern and southeastern provinces. Another 6,000 people were killed in the northern parts of neighboring Syria.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Millions of South Koreans are voting Tuesday for a new president in a snap election triggered by the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative who now faces an explosive trial on rebellion charges over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Pre-election surveys suggested Yoon\u2019s liberal archrival, Lee Jae-myung, appeared headed for an easy win, riding on deep public frustration over the conservatives in the wake of Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle.",
      "The main conservative candidate, Kim Moon Soo, has struggled to win over moderate, swing voters as his People Power Party remains in a quagmire of internal feuding over how to view Yoon\u2019s actions.",
      "This election serves as another defining moment in the country\u2019s resilient democracy, but observers worry a domestic divide worsened after Yoon's martial law stunt is far from over and could pose a big political burden on the new president.",
      "The past six months saw large crowds of people rallying in the streets to either denounce or support Yoon, while a leadership vacuum caused by Yoon\u2019s impeachment and ensuing formal dismissal rattled the country\u2019s high-level diplomatic activities and financial markets.",
      "The winning candidate will immediately be sworn in as president Wednesday for a single, full term of five years without the typical two-month transition period. The new president will face major challenges including a slowing economy, President Donald Trump\u2019s America-first policies and North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear threats.",
      "Voting began at 6 a.m. at 14,295 polling stations nationwide that will close at 8 p.m. Observers say the winner could emerge as early as midnight.",
      "As of 2 p.m., more than 13 million people had cast their ballots. Combined with the 15 million who voted during last week\u2019s two-day early voting period, voter turnout stood at 65.5%. South Korea has 44.4 million eligible voters.",
      "In a Facebook posting on Tuesday, Lee, whose Democratic Party led the legislative effort to oust Yoon, called for voters to \u201cdeliver a stern and resolute judgement\u201d against the conservatives over martial law.",
      "In one of his final campaign speeches Monday, Lee argued that a win by Kim would mean the \u201cthe return of the rebellion forces, the destruction of democracy and the deprival of people\u2019s human rights.\u201d He also promised to revitalize the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions. He urged the people to vote for him,",
      "Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, warned that a Lee win would allow him to wield excessive power, launch political retaliation against opponents and legislate laws to protect him from various legal troubles, as his party already controls parliament.",
      "Lee \u201cis now trying to seize all power in South Korea and establish a Hitler-like dictatorship,\u201d Kim told a rally in the southeastern city of Busan.",
      "Lee, who served as governor of Gyeonggi province and mayor of Seongnam city, has been a highly divisive figure in South Korean politics for years.",
      "As a former child laborer known for his inspirational rags-to-riches story, Lee came to fame through biting criticism of the country\u2019s conservative establishment and calls to build a more assertive South Korea in foreign policy. That rhetoric has given him an image as someone who can institute sweeping reforms and fix the country\u2019s deep-seated economic inequality and corruption.",
      "His critics view him as a dangerous populist who relies on a political division and backpedals on promises too easily.",
      "On foreign policy, Lee has not made any contentious remarks recently and has steadfastly vowed to pursue pragmatic diplomacy. He has called South Korea\u2019s alliance with the U.S. the foundation of its foreign policy and promised to solidify a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo partnership, a stance that is not much different than the position held by South Korea\u2019s conservatives.",
      "Experts say there aren\u2019t many diplomatic options for South Korea as it tries to address Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and calls for South Korea to pay more for the cost of the U.S. military presence, as well as North Korea\u2019s headlong pursuit of nuclear weapons. Experts say that has made both Lee and Kim avoid unveiling ambitious foreign policy goals.",
      "Lee\u2019s government still could become engaged in \u201ca little bit of friction\u201d with the Trump administration, while Kim\u2019s government, which prioritize relations with Washington, will likely offer more concessions to the U.S., said Chung Jin-young, a former dean of the Graduate School of Pan-Pacific International Studies at South Korea\u2019s Kyung Hee University.",
      "Chung predicted Lee won\u2019t be able to pursue overly drastic steps on foreign policy and security, given the country\u2019s foreign exchange and financial markets are very vulnerable to such changes.",
      "Lee has preached patience over Trump\u2019s tariff policy, arguing it would be a mistake to rush negotiations in pursuit of an early agreement with Washington. Kim has said he would meet Trump as soon as possible.",
      "On Monday, South Korean trade officials held an emergency meeting to discuss a response to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will raise tariffs on steel and aluminum products to 50% beginning June 4. South Korea\u2019s central bank last week sharply lowered its 2025 growth outlook to 0.8%, citing the potential impact of Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and weak domestic demand worsened by the political turmoil of past months.",
      "Relations with North Korea remain badly strained since 2019, with the North focused on expanding its nuclear arsenal while refusing dialogues with South Korea and the U.S.",
      "Since his second term began in January, Trump has repeatedly expressed his intent to resume diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but Kim has so far ignored the offer while making Russia his priority in foreign policy.",
      "Lee, who wants warmer ties with North Korea, recently acknowledged it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to realize a summit with Kim Jong Un anytime soon. Lee said he would support Trump\u2019s push to restart talks with Kim Jong Un, which he believed would eventually allow South Korea to be involved in some projects in North Korea.",
      "Foreign policy strategists for Lee understand there isn\u2019t much South Korea can do to bring about a denuclearization of North Korea, said Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University.",
      "He said Lee also doesn\u2019t share the Korean nationalistic zeal held by ex-liberal President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim Jong Un three times during his 2017-22 term.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- A second group of white South Africans has arrived in the United States under a refugee program announced by the Trump administration, officials and advocacy groups said Monday.",
      "Nine people, including families and children, arrived late last week, said Jaco Kleynhans, head of international liaison at the Solidarity Movement, a group representing members of South Africa's white Afrikaner minority. The group traveled on a commercial flight, he said.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy said in an email to The Associated Press that \u201crefugees continue to arrive in the United States from South Africa on commercial flights as part of the Afrikaner resettlement program\u2019s ongoing operations.\u201d",
      "An initial group of 59 white South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport in Virginia on a chartered flight last month under the new program announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in February. The Trump administration fast-tracked the resettlement of white South Africans after indefinitely suspending other U.S. refugee programs.",
      "The Trump administration said it is offering refugee status to white South Africans it alleges are being persecuted by their Black-led government and are victims of racially motivated violence. The South African government has denied the allegations and said they are a mischaracterization of the country.",
      "Trump has falsely claimed that white South African farmers are targeted in widespread attacks that amount to genocide and are having their land taken away. Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with those baseless claims during a meeting at the White House last month.",
      "Ramaphosa has said the relatively small number of attacks on white farmers are part of South Africa\u2019s larger problems with violent crime, which affects all races.",
      "The Trump administration initially said the refugee program was aimed at members of South Africa's Afrikaner minority, who are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers. In new guidance published by the U.S. Embassy last month, applicants must be \u201ca member of a racial minority\u201d in South Africa and \u201cmust be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of future persecution.\u201d",

      "A surprise Ukrainian drone attack that targeted several Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers was unprecedented in its scope and sophistication and for the first time reached as far as Siberia in a heavy blow to the Russian military.",
      "Ukraine said over 40 bombers, or about a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet, were damaged or destroyed Sunday, although Moscow said only several planes were struck. The conflicting claims couldn\u2019t be independently verified and video of the assault posted on social media showed only a couple of bombers hit.",
      "But the bold attack demonstrated Ukraine\u2019s capability to hit high-value targets anywhere in Russia, dealing a humiliating blow to the Kremlin and inflicting significant losses to Moscow's war machine.",
      "While some Russian military bloggers compared it to another infamous Sunday surprise attack \u2014 that of Japan's strike on the U.S. base at Pearl Harbor in 1941 \u2014 others rejected the analogy, arguing the actual damage was far less significant than Ukraine claimed.",
      "A look at what warplanes were reported hit:",
      "For decades, long-range bombers have been part of the Soviet and Russian nuclear triad that also includes land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and atomic-powered submarines carrying ICBMs. The strategic bombers have flown regular patrols around the globe showcasing Moscow\u2019s nuclear might.",
      "During the 3-year-old war in Ukraine, Russia has used the heavy planes to launch waves of cruise missile strikes across the country.",
      "The Tupolev Tu-95, which was code named Bear by NATO, is a four-engine turboprop plane designed in the 1950s to rival the U.S. B-52 bomber. The aircraft has an intercontinental range and carries eight long-range cruise missiles that can be equipped with conventional or nuclear warheads.",
      "Before Sunday, Russia was estimated to have a fleet of about 60 such aircraft.",
      "The Tupolev Tu-22M is a twin-engine supersonic bomber designed in the 1970s that was code named Backfire by NATO. It has a shorter range compared with the Tu-95, but during U.S.-Soviet arms control talks in the 1970s, Washington insisted on counting them as part of the Soviet strategic nuclear arsenal because of their capability to reach the U.S. if refueled in flight.",
      "The latest version of the plane, the Tu-22M3, carries Kh-22 cruise missiles that fly at more than three times the speed of sound. It dates to the 1970s, when it was designed by the Soviet Union to strike U.S. aircraft carriers. It packs a big punch, thanks to its supersonic speed and ability to carry 630 kilograms (nearly 1,400 pounds) of explosives, but its outdated guidance system could make it highly inaccurate against ground targets, raising the possibility of collateral damage.",
      "Some Tu-22Ms were lost in previous Ukrainian attacks, and Russia was estimated to have between 50 and 60 Tu-22M3s in service before Sunday's drone strike.",
      "The production of the Tu-95 and the Tu-22M ended after the 1991 collapse of the USSR, meaning that any lost can't be replaced.",
      "Russia also has another type of strategic nuclear-capable bomber, the supersonic Tu-160. Fewer than 20 of them are in service, and Russia has just begun production of its modernized version equipped with new engines and avionics.",
      "Russia lost a significant part of its heavy bomber fleet in the attack \u201cwith no immediate ability to replace it,\u201d said Douglas Barrie of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, noting that Moscow's announced plan to develop the next generation strategic bomber is still in its early phase.",
      "\u201cIronically this might give impetus to that program, because if if you want to keep your bomber fleet up to size, then you\u2019re going to have to do something at some point,\u201d he said.",
      "The A-50, which Ukrainian officials also said was hit in the strikes, is an early warning and control aircraft similar to the U.S. AWACS planes used to coordinate aerial attacks. Only a few such planes are in service with the Russian military, and any loss badly dents Russia's military capability.",
      "Repeated Ukrainian strikes on the Engels air base, the main base for Russian nuclear-capable strategic bombers near the Volga River city of Saratov, prompted Moscow to relocate the bombers to other bases farther from the conflict.",
      "One of them was Olenya on the Arctic Kola Peninsula, from where Tu-95s have flown multiple missions to launch cruise missiles at Ukraine. Several bombers at Olenya apparently were hit by the Ukrainian drones Sunday, according to analysts studying satellite images before and after the strike.",
      "Other drones targeted the Belaya air base in the Irkutsk region in eastern Siberia, destroying a few Tu-22M bombers, according to analysts.",
      "Ukraine said 41 aircraft \u2014 Tu-95s, Tu-22Ms and A-50s \u2014 were damaged or destroyed in the attack that it said was in the works for 18 months in which swarms of drones popped out of containers carried on trucks that were parked near four air bases.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was briefed on the attack, which represented a level of sophistication that Washington had not seen before, a senior defense official said on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said the attack set several warplanes ablaze at air bases in the Irkutsk region and the Murmansk region in the north, but the fires were extinguished.",
      "It said Ukraine also tried to strike two air bases in western Russia, as well as another one in the Amur region of Russia's Far East, but those attacks were repelled.",
      "The drone strikes produced an outcry from Russian military bloggers, who criticized the Defense Ministry for failing to learn from previous strikes and protect the bombers. Building shelters or hangars for such large planes is a daunting task, and the military has tried some impromptu solutions that were criticized as window dressing.",
      "Satellite images have shown Tu-95s at various air bases covered by layers of old tires \u2014 a measure of dubious efficiency that has drawn mockery on social media.",

      "Inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro fell to 1.9% in May from 2.2% in April, helping clear the way for more interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro fell to 1.9% in May from 2.2% in April, clearing the way for more rate cuts from the European Central Bank to support growth in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff offensive.",
      "Lower energy prices helped bring consumer prices in May to below the ECB's 2% target for the first time since September. Increasing signs that inflation is back under control after a painful outbreak in 2021-23 leaves room for the ECB to turn its attention to worries about the impact of a slew of new import taxes on EU goods in the US that threaten to slow Europe's export-oriented economy.",
      "Reductions in the ECB's benchmark rate, currently at 2.25%, lower borrowing costs throughout the economy, making it easier to buy things on credit and stimulating economic activity and investment. Higher rates combat inflation, but for the moment that battle appears to have been won.",
      "The ECB's rate-setting council meets on Thursday under bank President Christine Lagarde to determine the next step on rates. Analysts expect a cut of a quarter percentage point and for Lagarde to indicate that at least one more cut is possible at future meetings.",
      "Trump has raised tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos from almost all trading partners to 25%, and has now said he will raise the rate to 50% on steel, as well as proposing a 20% tariff on all European Union goods. That last tariff has been paused ahead of a July 14 deadline pending negotiations with EU officials. Worries about the impact of tariffs on growth led the European Union's executive commission to cut its growth forecast for the 20 euro member countries this year to 0.9% from 1.3% in its fall 2024 forecast.",

      "British utility Thames Water says a U.S. investment firm has dropped a rescue bid for the debt-burdened company",
      "LONDON -- British water and sewage utility Thames Water said Tuesday that a U.S. investment firm has dropped a rescue bid for the debt-burdened company.",
      "Thames Water said private equity company KKR decided not to make a bid and its status as preferred bidder had lapsed. The utility said it is talking to \u201csenior creditors\u201d about an alternative money-raising plan.",
      "\u201cWhilst today\u2019s news is disappointing, we continue to believe that a sustainable recapitalization of the company is in the best interests of all stakeholders and continue to work with our creditors and stakeholders to achieve that goal,\u201d Thames Water chairman Arian Montague said.",
      "The cash-strapped company, which provides water and sewage services to 16 million people in and around London, has teetered on the edge of insolvency under about 19 billion pounds ($26 billion) in debt. The utility received court approval in March for 3 billion pounds in emergency funding to keep it from falling into government administration.",
      "KKR\u2019s withdrawal makes it more likely the British government will have to nationalize the company, at least temporarily.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed said the government was \u201cmonitoring the situation,\u201d but \u201cThames (Water) itself remains stable.\u201d",

      "Last week the company was fined almost 123 million pounds ($166 million) for releasing sewage into rivers and streams while paying dividends to its shareholders.",
      "Consumers and politicians have criticized the company, arguing Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs.",

      "The iconic Goodyear airships are taking a victory lap over the skies of an Ohio city this week.",
      "The Akron-based tire company is celebrating the 100th anniversary of \u201cPilgrim,\u201d its first blimp to take flight just outside of the city on June 3, 1925.",
      "Goodyear began experimenting with vessels that would be lighter than aircraft in the early 1900s, and the dirigibles have since become a lasting and iconic symbol of the corporate brand. For some, it evokes nostalgia, while for others it offers a glimpse into a larger-than-life part of advertisement history.",
      "Here is a by-the-numbers look at Goodyear airships over time:",
      "Goodyear establishes an Aeronautics Department to build lighter-than-air aircrafts, and by 1912 the company had built its first balloon.",
      "In 1930, the \u201cDefender\u201d blimp became the first airship in the world to carry a lit neon sign so the company\u2019s name could be seen after dark.",
      "Goodyear began making airships for the U.S. Navy in 1917, and its first blimp \u2014 the first commercial non-rigid airship flown using helium \u2014 launched years later, becoming a marketing tool.",
      "From 1942 to 1944, the company built more than 150 airships for the Navy to serve in World War II, flying patrol over warships on the seas with zero reported loss of ships when a blimp was on watch.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform.",
      "Since that time, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology; safety innovations; high-definition cameras; aerial views captured with specialized systems that compensate for movement during filming, resulting in stable and smooth footage footage; and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "There currently are four Goodyear Blimps \u2014 the three in the U.S. and one in Friedrichshafen, Germany.",
      "Today\u2019s Goodyear Blimps are semi-rigid dirigibles, meaning they have an internal frame as compared to previous eras of blimps that could be fully deflated. In 2014, Goodyear transitioned to the New Technology semi-rigid airship platform designed to allow for improved maneuverability and speed.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp is 246 feet long (75 meters), which would cover about 80% of a football field. It is 58 feet (18 meters) high and holds three Olympic-sized swimming pools' worth of helium.",
      "Goodyear gets helium for its blimps from multiple sources. Because helium is a finite resource, the company purifies its helium every six to eight weeks to extend its life.",
      "The blimp travels more than 100 days per year, with trips ranging anywhere from three days to three weeks. A crew of nearly 20 people travel with the airship whenever it is touring. Today\u2019s Goodyear Blimps fly between 1,000 and 1,500 feet (305 meters and 457 meters) in the air and travel at speeds up to 73 miles per hour (117 kilometers per hour).",
      "There currently are fewer blimp pilots in the world than astronauts, according to Goodyear, which has 10 full-time pilots. To serve in that job, you must have a commercial pilot license followed by approximately 250 hours of training to earn an additional lighter-than-air airship rating from the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, but it was rapper Ice Cube who raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",

      "Gabrielle Cuccia calls herself a \u201cMAGA girl\u201d who made no secret of her support for President Donald Trump, even as she got a job covering the Pentagon for the One America News Network",
      "Assigned to cover the Pentagon for the conservative outlet One America News Network, Gabrielle Cuccia didn't pretend to be an unbiased reporter. She describes herself as \u201ca MAGA girl\u201d who is unapologetically defiant in her support of President Donald Trump.",
      "Yet days after publicly criticizing a Trump appointee, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Cuccia found herself out of a job.",
      "In taking to Substack last week to express a personal opinion about a figure she covers, Cuccia did something that would be frowned upon in many legacy newsrooms. The message that she was sent, however, is most likely to resound in places where opinion is fine \u2014 but only a certain variety.",
      "Cuccia's lengthy Substack post, \u201cThe Secretary of Defense-ive,\u201d was posted three days after Hegseth issued new rules that banned reporters from accessing large areas of the Pentagon without being watched by his minders.",
      "She criticized him for limiting freedom of movement in the name of national security.",
      "\u201cThe Pentagon wants to paint a picture that journalists are freely roaming classified spaces, sneaking into (secure areas), and leaking top-secret information,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd that is simply not true. There are security cameras everywhere, protocols in place and quite frankly, it would be painfully obvious if a reporter was in a space they didn't belong.\u201d",
      "Cuccia said the real leaks from the Pentagon have come from Hegseth's own team and other senior officials. Hegseth, a former Fox News personality, was embarrassed in March when The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief was mistakenly included in a Signal chat in which the defense secretary discussed upcoming military strikes.",
      "She criticized Hegseth for not yet holding a media briefing at the Pentagon.",
      "\u201cThe Commander-in-Chief welcomes the hard questions ... and yes, even the dumb ones,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhy won't the Secretary of Defense do the same?\u201d",
      "Three days after her Memorial Day Substack post, Cuccia said her Pentagon access badge was revoked. \u201cBy Friday,\" she said, \u201cI was out of a job.\u201d",
      "The Defense Department did not pull Cuccia's credentials, according to a Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues. Cuccia said OAN told her the Substack piece had been \u201cput on their radar,\u201d but she wouldn't say by who. She wouldn't speak further about what her employer told her, and OAN president Charles Herring told The Associated Press that it does not discuss personnel issues.",
      "\u201cWhen a reporter asks inconvenient questions about government overreach, the response should be accountability \u2014 not silence, and certainly not separation,\u201d Cuccia said.",
      "Traditionally, the legacy media does not want its journalists expressing opinions about people they cover, since it calls into doubt their ability to report without bias. But exceptions are often made in cases where media access is at issue, said Tom Rosenstiel, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
      "The New York Times, for example, institutionally called upon Joe Biden to meet more often with journalists when he was president. The Pentagon Press Association said Hegseth\u2019s restrictions were a direct assault on the freedom of the press.",
      "One America News Network makes no secret of its allegiance to Trump. When Matt Gaetz's nomination as Trump's attorney general fell apart following the election, OAN quickly signed him up as a contributor. OAN faced lawsuits \u2014 and negotiated settlements \u2014 for its promotion of Trump's false theories that he did not lose the 2020 election.",
      "When Hegseth earlier this year evicted several news organizations from their Pentagon workspaces and gave more room to friendly outlets, Cuccia was assigned space formerly held by NBC News. Before Hegseth aide Sean Parnell's only media briefing, Cuccia said Hegseth's team reached out to her in advance to find out what questions she wanted to ask, something that would never be done for most media outlets.",
      "If OAN is responsible for removing Cuccia, it's a \u201ctake no quarter position,\u201d Rosenstiel said. \u201cThere is no room, if you're on the team, to say anything that is negative.\u201d",
      "He said he'd be interested to see if any representatives from pro-Trump media outlets defend her. \u201cAre they silent, or do they rally to her in any way?\u201d he asked. Trump, in the past, has frequently criticized Fox News Channel for saying anything on the air that he deemed negative.",
      "Part of Cuccia's Substack post sounded almost prescient about what might happen to her, when she reminisced about the energy of the early Make America Great Again movement. Questioning government then, she noted, was a point of pride.",
      "\u201cSomewhere along the way, we as a collective decided \u2014 if anyone ever questioned a policy or person within the MAGA movement \u2014 that they weren't MAGA enough,\" she wrote. \"That they were deep state, that they couldn't be trusted, that they didn't love America as much as we do and that ... to put it bluntly, they sucked.\u201d",

      "U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year from 2.8% last year as President Donald Trump\u2019s erratic trade wars disrupt global commerce, drive up costs and leave businesses and consumers paralyzed by uncertainty",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year from 2.8% last year as President Donald Trump\u2019s erratic trade wars disrupt global commerce, drive up costs and leave businesses and consumers paralyzed by uncertainty.",
      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Tuesday that the U.S. economy \u2014 the world's largest \u2014 will slow further to just 1.5% in 2026. Trump\u2019s policies have raised average U.S. tariff rates from around 2.5% when he returned to the White House to 15.4%, highest since 1938, according to the OECD. Tariffs raise costs for consumers and American manufacturers that rely on imported raw materials and components.",
      "World economic growth will slow to just 2.9% this year and stay there in 2026, according to the OECD's forecast. It marks a substantial deceleration from growth of 3.3% global growth last year and 3.4% in 2023.",
      "The world economy has proven remarkably resilient in recent years, continuing to expand steadily \u2014 though unspectacularly \u2014 in the face of global shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But global trade and the economic outlook have been clouded by Trump's sweeping taxes on imports, the unpredictable way he's rolled them out and the threat of retaliation from other countries.",
      "Reversing decades of U.S. policy in favor of freer world trade, Trump has levied 10% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country on earth along with specific duties on steel, aluminum and autos. He's also threatened more import taxes, including a doubling of his tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%.",
      "Without mentioning Trump by name, OECD chief economist \u00c1lvaro Pereira wrote in a commentary that accompanied the forecast that \"we have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment.''",
      "Adding to the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s trade wars: A federal court in New York last week blocked most of Trump\u2019s tariffs, ruling that he\u2019d overstepped his authority in imposing them. Then an appeals court allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the taxes while appeals worked their way through the U.S. courts.",
      "China \u2014 the world's second-biggest economy \u2014 is forecast to see growth decelerate from 5% last year to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026. Chinese exporters will be hurt by Trump's tariffs, hobbling an economy already weakened by the collapse of the nation's real estate market. Some of the damage will be offset by help from the government: Beijing last month outlined plans to cut interest rates and encourage bank lending as well as allocating more money for factory upgrades and elder care, among other things.",
      "The 20 countries that share the euro currency will collectively see economic growth pick up from 0.8% last year to 1% in 2025 and 1.2% next year, the OECD said, helped by interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank.",

      "The head of the U.S. Energy Department says President Donald Trump wants to double the amount of oil coursing through Alaska\u2019s 800-mile pipeline system and build a massive natural gas export project as its twin",
      "DEADHORSE, Alaska -- President Donald Trump wants to double the amount of oil coursing through Alaska's vast pipeline system and build a massive natural gas project as its \u201cbig, beautiful twin,\u201d a top administration official said Monday while touring a prolific oil field near the Arctic Ocean.",
      "The remarks by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright came as he and two other Trump Cabinet members \u2014 Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin \u2014 visited Prudhoe Bay as part of a multiday trip aimed at highlighting Trump\u2019s push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state that drew criticism from environmentalists.",
      "During the trip, Burgum\u2019s agency announced plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in portions of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.",
      "The petroleum reserve is west of Prudhoe Bay and Deadhorse, the industrial encampment near the starting point of the trans-Alaska pipeline system. The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska\u2019s economic lifeline for nearly 50 years.",
      "Government and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials\u2019 trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday.",
      "For years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.",
      "Oil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape.",
      "\u201cYou have the big two right here,\" he said. \u201cLet\u2019s double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\u201d",
      "Oil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 \u2014 a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day.",
      "Those joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik.",
      "In Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump\u2019s push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.",
      "Alaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.",
      "Murkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \u201cwant to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\u201d",
      "Environmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed.",
      "Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \u201cvery frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.",
      "The three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

      "A construction project on one of Newark Liberty International Airport's three main runways wrapped up nearly two weeks early, so the Federal Aviation Administration should be able to ease flight limits soon, but the shortage of air traffic controllers could still cause problems.",
      "Federal Transportation Department officials plan to join the CEO of United Airlines and airport officials in providing an update on operations at New Jersey\u2019s biggest airport Monday afternoon. The runway was scheduled to go back into service Monday, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.",
      "Crews worked day and night to complete the $121 million construction project ahead of schedule and ease some of the problems at the airport. But Newark has also been plagued by cancellations and delays this spring because of a shortage of air traffic controllers after the FAA had technical problems that twice briefly knocked out the radar and communications at a facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of the airport.",
      "\u201cCompleting this major portion of the runway rehabilitation 13 days ahead of schedule is a testament to the extraordinary commitment and around-the-clock efforts of construction crews and our airport staff,\u201d said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O\u2019Toole.",
      "The FAA didn't immediately answer questions Monday morning about when operations might change at the Newark airport.",
      "Five air traffic controllers went on 45-day trauma leaves after the first radar and communications outage at the Philadelphia facility on April 28, and another one is out on medical leave. That left the facility with only 16 certified controllers and five supervisors. Officials have said there are another 16 experienced controllers in training that should get certified sometime between now and October.",
      "The FAA limited the Newark airport to 28 arrivals and 28 departures an hour last month because of the construction and staff shortages. The agency has said that it expects to be able to bump up the number of flights daily in Newark to 34 arrivals and 34 departures once the runway construction is done. But it's not immediately clear if the FAA will have to wait until the controllers on trauma leave are scheduled to return around the middle of the month.",
      "Before the air traffic control problems this spring, 38 or 39 flights typically took off and landed hourly at the Newark airport.",
      "The FAA has said it will revisit the limits again in October because it hopes to have more controllers trained by then.",
      "The government also upgraded the software at the air traffic control facility after a second radar outage on May 9. That helped prevent a repeat problem on May 11 when there was another problem with the lines carrying the radar signal down from New York.",
      "Verizon has installed a new fiber optic line between Philadelphia and New York after the problems but that isn't expected to go into service until July after testing is completed.",

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The European Union on Monday said it is preparing \u201ccountermeasures\u201d against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.",
      "EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to \u201caccelerate talks\u201d on a deal, but that if those trade negotiations fail \u201cthen we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side,\" European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.",
      "\u201cIn the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,\u201d Gill said.",

About halfway through that grace period, Trump announced a 50% tariffs on steel imports.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away. Top officials at the EU\u2019s executive commission says they\u2019re pushing hard for a trade deal to avoid a 50% tariff on imported goods.",
      "The EU could possibly buy more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the U.S., as well as lower duties on cars, but it isn't likely to budge on calls to scrap the value added tax \u2014 which is akin to a sales tax \u2014 or open up the EU to American beef.",
      "The EU has offered the US a \u201czero for zero\u201d outcome in which tariffs would be removed on both sides industrial goods including autos. Trump has dismissed that but EU officials have said it\u2019s still on the table.",
      "The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on steel imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are so ubiquitous in packaging, they\u2019re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.",

      "Starmer said Britain \u201ccannot ignore the threat that Russia poses\u201d as he pledged to undertake the most sweeping changes to Britain's defenses since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than three decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe threat we face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer told workers and journalists at a navy shipyard in Scotland.",
      "Like other NATO members, the U.K. has been reassessing its defense spending since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The government announced military plans in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It's the first such review since 2021, and lands in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and by the re-election of President Donald Trump last year.",
      "Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \u201cfighting big tank battles on European landmass\u201d are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.",
      "Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air sea and in cyberspace.",
      "The measures include increasing production of submarines and weapons and \u201clearning the lessons of Ukraine,\" which has rapidly developed its drone technology to counter Moscow's forces and even hit targets deep inside Russia.",
      "The government said the U.K, will also establish a cyber command to counter \u201cdaily\u201d Russia-linked attacks on Britain's defenses.",
      "Monday\u2019s announcements include building \u201cup to 12\u201d nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds in Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret.",
      "The government will also increase conventional Britain\u2019s weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.",
      "Starmer said rearming would create a \u201cdefense dividend\u201d of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs \u2014 a contrast to the post-Cold War \u201cpeace dividend\u201d that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \u201ca message to Moscow,\u201d and transform the country\u2019s military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a two-century low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.",
      "Healey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \u201con track\u201d and that there\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d it will hit 3% before 2034.",
      "Starmer said the 3% goal is an \u201cambition,\u201d rather than a firm promise, and it\u2019s unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.",
      "Starmer said he wouldn\u2019t make a firm pledge until he knew \u201cprecisely where the money is coming from.\u201d",
      "Even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.",
      "It's also a message to Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defense.",
      "European countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don\u2019t pull their weight.",

      "His win also reflects the appeal of right-wing nationalism across Europe, where concerns about migration, national sovereignty, and cultural identity have led to surging support for parties on the right \u2014 even the far right in recent times.",
      "Far-right candidates did very well in Poland's first round of voting two weeks earlier, underlining the appeal of the nationalist and conservative views. Nawrocki picked up many of those votes.",
      "As his supporters celebrate his win, those who voted for the defeated liberal candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, worry that it will hasten the erosion of liberal democratic norms.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s presidency presents a direct challenge to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who returned to power in late 2023 pledging to mend relations with the EU and restore judicial independence which Brussels said was eroded by Law and Justice, the party that backed Nawrocki.",
      "But Tusk's coalition \u2014 a fragile alliance of centrists, leftists, and agrarian conservatives \u2014 has struggled to push through key promises including a civil union law for same-sex couples and a less restrictive abortion law.",
      "Nawrocki, who opposes such measures, will have the power to veto legislation, complicating Tusk\u2019s agenda and potentially triggering political gridlock.",
      "Nawrocki's election could signal a stronger relationship between Poland and the Trump administration.",
      "Poland and the U.S. are close allies, and there are 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in Poland, but Tusk and his partners in the past have been critical of Trump. Nawrocki, however, has a worldview closely aligned with Trump and his Make America Great Again ethos.",
      "Trump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago and his administration made clear in other ways that he was its preferred candidate.",
      "While Nawrocki has voiced support for Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russian aggression, he does not back Ukrainian membership in NATO and has questioned the long-term costs of aid \u2014 particularly support for refugees.",
      "His rhetoric has at times echoed that of Trump, for instance by accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of what he said was insufficient gratitude for Poland\u2019s assistance. With growing public fatigue over helping Ukrainian refugees, Nawrocki\u2019s approach could shift Poland\u2019s posture from strong ally to conditional partner if the war drags on much longer.",
      "The election result is a setback for the EU, which had welcomed Tusk\u2019s return in 2023 as a signal of renewed pro-European engagement.",
      "Nawrocki and the Law and Justice party have criticized what nationalists view as EU overreach into Poland's national affairs, especially regarding judicial reforms and migration policy.",
      "While the president does not control day-to-day diplomacy, Nawrocki\u2019s symbolic and veto powers could frustrate Brussels\u2019 efforts to bring Poland back into alignment with bloc standards, particularly on rule-of-law issues.",
      "Though an EU member, Poland has its own currency, the zloty, which weakened slightly on Monday morning, reflecting investor concerns over potential policy instability and renewed tensions with EU institutions.",
      "Billions of euros in EU funding has been linked to judicial reforms which Tusk's government will now be unlikely to enact without presidential cooperation.",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s doubling of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum could hit Americans in an unexpected place: grocery aisles",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s doubling of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum could hit Americans in an unexpected place: grocery aisles.",
      "The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on those imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are so ubiquitous in packaging, they\u2019re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.",
      "\u201cRising grocery prices would be part of the ripple effects,\u201d says Usha Haley, an expert on trade and professor at Wichita State University, who added that the tariffs could raise costs across industries and further strain ties with allies \u201cwithout aiding a long-term U.S. manufacturing revival.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away, in such a whiplash-inducing frenzy it\u2019s hard to keep up. He insisted the latest tariff hike was necessary to \u201ceven further secure the steel industry in the U.S.\u201d",
      "That promise, though, could be at odds with his pledge to reduce food costs.",
      "Rising grocery prices, Trump has said, were among the biggest reasons voters swung his way. A look around a supermarket makes clear how many products could be impacted by new taxes on steel and aluminum, from beer and soda to dog food to can after can of beans, fruit, tomato paste and more.",
      "\u201cIt plays into the hands of China and other foreign canned food producers, which are more than happy to undercut American farmers and food producers,\u201d insists Can Manufacturers Institute president Robert Budway. \u201cDoubling the steel tariff will further increase the cost of canned goods at the grocery store.\u201d",
      "Budway says production by domestic tin mill steel producers, whose products are used in cans, have dramatically decreased in recent years, making manufacturers reliant on imported materials. When those prices go up, he says, \u201cthe cost is levied upon millions of American families.\u201d",
      "Food companies were already warily assessing the administration\u2019s tariffs before the latest hike, which Trump said would go into effect on Wednesday. The Campbell Co., whose soup cans are a staple for millions of Americans, has said it was working to mitigate the impact of tariffs but may be forced to raise prices. ConAgra Brands, which puts everything from cans of Reddi-Whip to cooking sprays like Pam on supermarket shelves, likewise has pointed to the impact steel and aluminum tariffs have.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t get all of our materials from the US because there\u2019s no supply,\u201d ConAgra CFO David Marberger said at a recent Goldman Sachs conference on global staples.",
      "Beyond the obvious products \u2014 canned foods like tuna, chicken broth and cranberry sauce \u2014 economists warn of a spillover effect that tariffs can have on a gamut of items. If the cost to build a store or buy a truck to haul food rise, the prices of products may follow.",
      "Most Americans will never buy a tractor, but Babak Hafezi, who runs a global consulting firm and teaches international business at American University, says a price spike in such a big-ticket item vital to food production will spill down to all sorts of other items.",
      "\u201cIf a John Deere tractor costs 25% more, consumers pay the price for that,\u201d Hafezi says. \u201cThis trickles down the economy and impacts every aspect of the economy. Some of the trickling is immediate and others are slower to manifest themselves. But yes, prices will increase and choices will decrease.\u201d",
      "Trump appeared before a crowd of cheering steelworkers to unveil the new tariffs at a rally outside Pittsburgh. In a statement, David McCall, president of the United Steelworkers International union, called tariffs \u201ca valuable tool in balancing the scales\u201d but \u201cwider reforms of our global trading system\" are needed.",
      "It may be harder to gauge the weight of tariffs on, say, a can of chickpeas versus that of a new car, but consumers are likely to see myriad indirect costs from the levies, says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade.",
      "\u201cAnybody who\u2019s directly connected to the steel industry, they\u2019re going to benefit. It\u2019s just coming at a very high cost,\u201d Waldkirch says. \u201cYou may get a few more steel jobs. But all these indirect costs mean you then destroy jobs elsewhere. If you were to add that all in, you come up with a pretty large negative loss.\u201d",

      "Black women are starting to pay more for their hair care because of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on goods imported from China",
      "ATLANTA -- Before the oppressive summer heat descends on Atlanta, therapist Brittanee Sims usually gets her thick, curly hair braided at a salon to preserve her healthy mane.",
      "But it\u2019s more expensive this year. So she'll only pay for her teenage daughter and son to get their summer hairdos. Not having braided hair \u201ccreates more of a hassle for everything,\u201d said Sims, who counts herself among the tens of millions of women that regularly spend on the Black hair care industry.",
      "Now, she said, she has to \u201cgo home and figure out what I\u2019m gonna do to my hair in the morning, after I went to the gym and it\u2019s messed up with sweating and frizz.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving up prices for products many Black women consider essential, squeezing shoppers and stylists even more as they grapple with inflation and higher rents. Much of the synthetic braiding hair, human hair for extensions, wigs and weaves, styling tools, braiding gel and other products is imported from or has packaging from China, which was subject to a combined 145% tariff in April. India also is a major global source of human hair.",
      "Many Black women have hair types and workplace-favored styles that require careful attention, and they can spend hundreds of dollars at salons each month on extensions, weaves, wigs and braids. The Associated Press spoke with several Black hair industry experts, beauty supply store owners, and wholesale companies, as well as nearly two dozen Black stylists and braiders, some of whom may have to raise prices even as business has slowed.",
      "On Thursday, a federal appeals court reinstated most of Trump's tariffs on imported goods after they were blocked the day before by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "Earlier this month, the United States agreed to drop the 145% tax on goods imported from China to 30% while the two economic superpowers negotiate new trade agreements. Imports from most other countries face baseline tariff rates at 10%.",
      "Regardless, the next few months \u201care already shot\u201d for many items, said Marty Parker, a University of Georgia business professor and supply chain expert who worked in the hair care industry. The costs companies have been facing at ports are making their way down to consumers, supply shortages are getting worse, and it's unclear what will happen if negotiations break down.",
      "\u201cPrices go up very fast and come down very slow,\u201d Parker said.",
      "Some stylists said they're seeing fewer clients because prices are going up for virtually everything.",
      "Atlanta stylists are paying more for hair from China. Atlanta stylist Yana Ellis, who also sells products like wigs, paid an extra $245 in shipping for 52 bundles of hair in March compared to 40 bundles in December. AaNiyah Butler said her shipping costs for human hair more than doubled from February to May. And Dajiah Blackshear found in early May that a beauty supply store raised the cost of the kind of hair she\u2019s used for years by $100.",
      "The store owner said he may have to stop selling that brand of hair because it went up so much. Similarly, some wholesale hair stores have seen higher costs or are expecting them in the coming weeks. Even the typical $6 to $10 cost of a pack of synthetic hair has crept up.",
      "Blackshear doesn't want clients to bring hair because she likes to vet the quality. But if expenses continue to mount, she may have to raise her prices.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely difficult,\u201d she said, especially for clients who are \"having to make those hard decisions, between \u2018do I get my hair done or do I pay my bills?\u2019\u201d",
      "Janice Lowe, who runs 5 Starr Salon in a lower-income neighborhood southeast of Atlanta, has started asking clients to bring hair and is unable to purchase certain products.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m falling behind on my obligations,\u201d she said.",
      "Consultants vary on how much prices will rise, when they\u2019ll go up and for how long \u2014 and the full harm to stylists and consumers could be months away.",
      "The global Black hair care industry was worth about $3.2 billion in 2023, according to market.us, and Black women spend six times more on hair care than other ethnicities.",
      "Stylists often purchase some harder-to-get professional products from door-to-door distributors that buy from wholesale companies or larger distributors that purchase directly from other countries.",
      "Lowe has seen some of her distributors vanish altogether, making it harder to get professional lines such as Black-owned leading professional hair care brand Design Essentials, manufactured in Atlanta at McBride Research Laboratories.",
      "Design Essentials is trying to delay big price increases until 2026 or 2027, and may turn to layoffs or pause promotions to save money, said president Cornell McBride Jr. Most packaging plastics come from China, but ingredients can come from many places.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to put it to the consumer but the person who pays is the consumer in the end,\u201d McBride Jr. said.",
      "Hawa Keita and her mother usually charge customers between $160 and $250 for braiding at their shop, Eve\u2019s African Hair Braiding in College Park southwest of Atlanta. Keita is determined to take losses because their customers \u201ccan\u2019t afford the Atlanta prices,\u201d Keita said.",
      "The cost of a box of 100 packs of braiding hair from China went up for the first time in two years, from $250 to $300, Keita said. They order weekly, often multiple boxes. Some companies say they'll soon raise prices or run out of stock.",
      "Making customers happy is ultimately what will keep the business afloat, Keita said. She smiled as she recounted braiding a young woman\u2019s hair for her birthday with a style she suggested.",
      "\u201cWhen we finished, she gave me the biggest hug, and she was in here screaming and just yelling because she just really loved her hair,\u201d Keita said.",
      "For many Black Americans, especially women, affording their hair care also means confronting unfavorable beauty standards. Georgia State University law professor Tanya Washington said recent discoveries about dangerous chemicals in synthetic hair and hair straightening products have sparked conversations among Black women looking for hairstyles that don't require as much imported products.",
      "But embracing natural hairdos can be daunting for women like the soon-to-be lawyers and clerks Washington advises who face pressure to straighten their hair.",
      "\u201cThat puts everyone who does not have organically, naturally derived straight hair at a disadvantage in these spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that a definition of professionalism that favors one phenotype \u2014 European phenotype \u2014 over all others, is inappropriate.\"",
      "Longstanding income disparities between Black and white American women can also make higher hair care prices untenable. According to the U.S. Census, as of 2023, the median household income in Atlanta is $131,319 for white households and $47,937 for Black households.",
      "It's an inequality issue that professional hairstylists are aware of nationwide.",
      "Stylist Mitzi Mitchell, owner of PIC ONE Beauty Services in Pennsylvania, said she has stocked up on certain products and tools for another year in anticipation of price increases.",
      "She wants to avoid \u201cbootleg\u201d products, which are made illegally and often aren\u2019t as safe, but became much more prevalent in the marketplace during economic downturns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really conscientious about my Black minority clients because we make a heck of a lot less than other nationalities,\u201d said Mitchell, who is Black. \u201cI try to keep prices low so we can continue to have the same services, but I know I will have to raise it.\u201d",

      "At least 16 people have been hospitalized after eating cucumbers produced by Florida-based Bedner Growers and distributed by Fresh Start Produce Sales, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The cucumbers were sold from April 29 through May 19.",
      "The outbreak includes reports of illness from people aboard six different cruise ships that departed from U.S. ports between late March and mid-April, the CDC said. The true number of sick people is likely much higher and the outbreak could affect additional states, officials said.",
      "Several companies have issued recalls for whole cucumbers and cucumbers used in a range of sandwiches, salsas and other foods linked to the outbreak. Target recalled dozens of products, including whole cucumbers, salads and vegetable rolls.",
      "The outbreak was detected during a follow-up inspection in April to a 2024 outbreak that sickened 551 people and led to 155 hospitalizations in 34 states and Washington, D.C.

      "Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has vetoed a bill that would have made Colorado the first state to ban landlords from using rent-setting algorithms, which many advocates have blamed for driving up housing costs across the country.",
      "RealPage is the target of a federal lawsuit filed last year that accuses the real estate software company of facilitating an illegal scheme to help landlords coordinate to hike rental prices. Eight other states, including Colorado, have joined the Department of Justice's lawsuit, though RealPage has vehemently denied any claims of collusion and has fought to have the lawsuit dismissed.",
      "Critics say RealPage software combines confidential information from each real estate management company in ways that enable landlords to align prices and avoid competition that would otherwise push down rents. RealPage\u2019s clients include huge landlords who collectively oversee millions of units across the U.S.",
      "The Colorado bill, which recently passed the Democratic-led Legislature along party lines, would have prevented the use of such algorithms.",
      "In a veto letter Thursday, Polis said he understands the intent of the bill but that any collusion among landlords would already violate existing law.",
      "\u201cReducing market friction through legitimate means that do not entail collusion is good for both renters and landlords,\u201d Polis wrote. \u201cWe should not inadvertently take a tool off the table that could identify vacancies and provide consumers with meaningful data to help efficiently manage residential real estate to ensure people can access housing.\u201d",
      "In a statement, RealPage applauded Polis' veto, calling it an example of \u201ccourageous leadership.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the right outcome for all of us who desire a healthy housing ecosystem that benefits Colorado renters and housing providers alike,\u201d said Jennifer Bowcock, a spokesperson for the Texas-based firm.",
      "But Polis' decision outraged local housing advocates and the American Economic Liberties Project, a consumer rights advocacy group that has helped lead the fight against RealPage and other companies that use rent-setting algorithms.",
      "\u201cThis veto sends the devastating message that corporate landlords can keep using secret price-fixing algorithms to take extra rent from people who have the least,\u201d said Sam Gilman, co-founder and president of the Community Economic Defense Project, a Colorado-based nonprofit.",
      "RealPage software provides daily recommendations to help landlords and their employees price their available apartments. The landlords do not have to follow the suggestions, but critics argue that because the software has access to a vast trove of confidential data, it helps RealPage's clients charge the highest possible rent.",
      "Although Colorado was the first state to pass a bill targeting rental algorithms, at least six cities have passed similar ordinances over the past year. They include Philadelphia; Minneapolis; San Francisco; Berkeley, California; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Providence, Rhode Island.",
      "RealPage has decried those measures and sued over Berkeley's ordinance, saying it violates the company\u2019s free speech rights and is the result of an \u201cintentional campaign of misinformation and often-repeated false claims\u201d about its products.",
      "RealPage argues that the real driver of high rents is a lack of housing supply. It also says that its pricing recommendations often encourage landlords to drop rents since landlords are incentivized to maximize revenue and maintain high occupancy.",
      "A clause recently added to Republicans\u2019 signature \u201c big, beautiful \u201d tax bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade. On Tuesday, five Democratic senators sent a letter to RealPage asking if the company was involved in getting that clause inserted.",
      "In an email, Bowcock said RealPage was not involved in the AI moratorium language, but she said the company supports \u201ca thoughtful, well-grounded, and consistent regulatory approach to AI, rather than a patchwork of state and local legislation.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- Lo\u00efs Boisson had never played at the French Open, let alone in the biggest arena at Roland-Garros.",
      "They didn't faze the French wild card.",
      "Boisson, ranked 361st, threw her head back and roared after beating American No. 3 Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Court Philippe-Chatrier in Monday's fourth-round play.",
      "She is by far the lowest-ranked woman to beat someone ranked in the top five at the French Open in 40 years. The lowest previously in that span was No. 179 Aniko Kapros, who eliminated No. 5 Justine Henin in the first round in 2002.",
      "Boisson also is the lowest-ranked woman to reach the quarterfinals at Roland-Garros since at least 1985.",
      "Quite some victory, considering also Pegula was the U.S. Open runner-up last year. Understandably, Boisson was nervous as she served for the match and saved three break points.",
      "After Pegula missed an easy-looking winner at the net and clutched her head in her hands, Boisson had her first match point, the biggest point of her career.",
      "Pegula returned a strong serve to the back of the court where Boisson unleashed a brilliant forehand winner down the line. She then raised her arms and realized the enormity of her win.",
      "\u201c\u2018Thank you to all of you,'\" Boisson told the crowd in her post-match interview. \u201cPlaying on this court with such an atmosphere was really incredible.\u201d",
      "Boisson made the notoriously hard-to-please crowd laugh when she added: \u201cI'm really happy on here. I can stay a long time if you like.\u201d",
      "The crowd broke into chants of \u201cLo\u00efs, Lo\u00efs\" and she waved back to them.",
      "She was in the news last month. British player Harriet Dart apologized to Boisson after asking the chair umpire to tell her to put some deodorant on. Now she's the only French player \u2014 male or female \u2014 left at Roland-Garros. But she feels comfortable on clay, having played on it regularly since taking up tennis when she was eight years old.",
      "Asked what her ambitions were for the rest of the tournament \u2014 she plays sixth-seeded Mirra Andreeva on Wednesday in the quarterfinals \u2014 she replied, \u201cI hope to win, right?\u201d",
      "That prompted more laughter from the crowd, which included tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, who has been criticized by some for the lack of women players in night sessions.",
      "Top-ranked Jannik Sinner was playing his fourth-round match later Monday in the night session against No. 17 Andrey Rublev, following 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic's match against Britain's Cameron Norrie.",

She playfully threw her wristband at Andreeva when they came to the net and Andreeva joked she would keep it.",
      "No. 7 Madison Keys advanced on Court Suzanne-Lenglen after beating Hailey Baptiste 6-3, 7-5 in an all-American contest. There's another one coming for Keys against Gauff.",

      "LEBANON, Tenn. -- Bubba Wallace sees NASCAR having all the momentum possible right now with different media partners.",
      "Perfect timing then for NASCAR's \u201cIn-season Challenge\u201d to debut, right?",
      "Well, Wallace forgot that was about to debut.",
      "\u201cFor me to forget about it and remember how exciting it was when they announced, I think it\u2019s going to be big for the fans to tune in and and give them a little bit more ... you\u2019re just invested more,\" Wallace said.",
      "Kyle Larson just tried his latest attempt at \u201cthe Double\u201d of the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600. Count him among those who didn't realize NASCAR's new in-season competition had its field of 32 set after Sunday night's Cup Series race at the Nashville Superspeedway.",
      "\u201cI just really haven\u2019t seen anything promoted about it, so I think it\u2019s easy to forget about it,\" Larson said.",
      "NASCAR announced this new in-season competition in May 2024, so drivers can be forgiven for being focused on the second half of the season.",
      "The format is simple: 32 drivers race for seeding over the next three races starting at Michigan on Sunday and concluding at Pocono on June 22. Drivers are seeded by their best finish for the five-race competition starting at Atlanta.",
      "Then it goes to single elimination with the field cut to 16 at Chicago, eight at Sonoma, four at Dover and the final two at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The winner gets $1 million, and that does get drivers' attention as part of the new media rights deal that includes TNT.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be something fun that you pay attention to, and there\u2019s good money on the line,\u201d said Larson, the 2021 Cup Series champ. \u201cSo, you've just got to be really consistent throughout.\u201d",
      "Chris Buescher of RFK Racing is among those who didn't realize this challenge is starting. He needs race victories after losing points for a penalty at Kansas in May. The prize is nice.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s real money,\" Buescher said. \"But I don\u2019t want that to change how we go to the race track. We need to figure out how to win races. There\u2019s a lot more than that on the line at the end of the year.\u201d",
      "Three-time Cup Series champ Joey Logano compared this event's prize to the money up for grabs in the All-Star Race and this new competition like a stage win.",
      "\u201cThis is a little longer thing, but it\u2019s a race within the race,\" Logano said. \u201cSo you\u2019re not willing to give up a lot to do that, right?\u201d",
      "Denny Hamlin was excited when the In-season Challenge was first announced. Then he saw the courses for this competition, and his enthusiasm dimmed with the number of road courses included.",
      "\u201cTruthfully, we\u2019re going to get pretty lucky or have such a good draw that just things kind of work out,\" Hamlin said. \"I wish it was more conventional ovals, but I think that\u2019s just the way the schedule works out. And it\u2019s unfortunately not probably my prime part of the season.\u201d",
      "Brad Keselowski and his No. 6 Ford for RFK Racing went into Nashville at 32 \u2014 right on the line to be included in that chase for seeding. He hadn't given the competition much thought focused on this season. But he thinks it will be fun once it starts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good for the sport, good for our fans and it\u2019s a competition,\u201d Keselowski said. \"If there\u2019s competition, we want to win it. But that said, I think our heads down on one week at a time, in some ways one day at a time. ... And it\u2019s hard to look further ahead than that.\u201d",
      "With Ryan Blaney's first victory of the season at Nashville Superspeedway, Team Penske now has its three drivers qualified for the NASCAR Cup playoffs even with Nashville the first race of the second half of this year.",
      "Blaney, who hadn't won since November, joined Austin Cindric, who won at Talladega, and three-time Cup Series champ Joey Logano, a winner at Texas. Josh Berry, whose Wood Brothers Racing team has a relationship with Team Penske, also won at Las Vegas.",
      "Michael Nelson, president of Team Penske's NASCAR operations, said it was nice to have that pressure off all the teams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s obviously pretty awesome to have a little bit of that pressure off for the guys,\" Nelson said. \"And again ... it gives you a chance to go out and take some chances here and there and try to rack up a bunch of wins. So now we\u2019re grateful to be at this point with our cars this time of year.\u201d",
      "Carson Hocevar matched his career-best finish driving from 26th to second at Nashville. The 22-year-old driver in his second Cup Series season with Spire Motorsports ticked off Ricky Stenhouse Jr. with his aggressive style.",
      "Hocevar clipped Stenhouse on Lap 106 of 300, sending him into the wall and out of the race. Stenhouse said Hocevar was overly aggressive and will talk to the young driver. Just not after the race.",
      "\u201cNo,\" Stenhouse said, \"that costs too much money.\u201d",

      "Tyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner beamed as they carried the Indiana Pacers shiny, new Eastern Conference championship trophy into their postgame news conferences Saturday night",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The Pacers have finally ended the franchise's 25-year NBA Finals drought, achieving the unthinkable after starting 10-15 and looking like anything but a title contender.",
      "Now Indiana will try to exorcise the demons of its decades-long, snake-bitten history and actually win the title when the Pacers take on the Oklahoma City in the NBA Finals.",
      "\u201cIt is really a special thing that happened 25 years ago, I wasn\u2019t even six months old,\u201d Tyrese Haliburton said after Indiana's series-ending victory over New York. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fans who have never seen success from this organization, especially people around my age. They weren\u2019t alive for it.",
      "\"So it\u2019s really special what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re just trying to keep making this a special place, a place where people want to come.\u201d",
      "The Pacers play in a state where basketball is treated like religion, championship teams become royals and players and coaches emerge as revered figures when they achieve the unexpected like these Pacers.",
      "But Indiana hasn't always been that dream destination for NBA players, instead being tabbed as snake-bitten franchise for most of its 48 seasons in the league.",
      "\u2014 After winning three ABA titles, it took a telethon to save the financially floundering NBA newbie in July 1977.",
      "\u2014 The Pacers made just one playoff appearance during their first decade in the NBA, losing both games to Philadelphia.",
      "\u2014 Fans booed resoundingly when the Pacers used a first-round draft pick on Reggie Miller in 1987 instead of home-state favorite Steve Alford.",
      "\u2014 And their pathway to championships in the 1990s seemed hopelessly blocked by Michael Jordan's Bulls or Patrick Ewing's the Knicks until the breakthrough run in 2000 only to lose to Shaquille O'Neal, the late Kobe Bryant and the Lakers.",
      "And though Miller was still playing at a high level, it has taken another quarter-century to make it back.",
      "The journey hasn't been an easy one.",
      "This Pacers team rallied to eliminate some other snake-bitten opponents. They knocked out the 2021 NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks, the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers and the rival Knicks. The second final chapter begins Thursday in Oklahoma City.",
      "The expectations were different 25 years ago.",
      "Donnie Walsh revamped Indiana's roster by surrounding Miller with younger players following the 1999-2000 season, and four seasons later the Pacers posted the league's best record in 2003-04. They wound up losing the conference final in six games to Detroit.",
      "Then came the franchise-changing Malice in the Palace brawl in November 2004.",
      "Several lengthy suspensions gutted the team, derailing Miller's last title run while sending the franchise into a downward spiral. Larry Bird fired coach Rick Carlisle, his friend and ex-teammate, two years later and his departure was followed by a rash of devastating injuries.",
      "Danny Granger's budding career was cut short by knee tendinitis. Paul George suffered a compound fracture in his right leg in 2014 and he was traded to Oklahoma City in 2017. Two years later, All-Star guard Victor Oladipo ruptured his right quadriceps tendon and was subsequently traded, too.",
      "Myles Turner experienced most of the ups and downs of that decade from the Pacers locker room, and it only made his opportunity to hug Miller and Nancy Leonard, the widow of former Pacers longtime coach and broadcaster Bobby \u201cSlick\u201d Leonard, so much sweeter after winning the conference crown.",
      "\u201cIt was just pure excitement, pure validation,\" Turner said. \u201cJust all the years, all the hate, all the love, everything in between. So, man, in that moment, it was just pure exuberance.\u201d",
      "Turner was a pivotal piece \u2014 not the central one \u2014 when president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard embarked on another rebuild midway through the 2021-22 season to form the core of this year's squad.",
      "He started by dealing All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis to Sacramento for Haliburton. Five months later, Indiana acquired forward Aason Nesmith from Boston for Malcolm Brogdon. And when Pritchard sent Bruce Brown to Toronto for Pascal Siakam in January 2024, Pritchard figured the Pacers finally had their big three.",
      "Fans were skeptical, but the Pacers ushered in a new era of basketball, one that combined Indiana's favorite sport with its longtime auto racing tradition, creating a track-like pace brand of basketball.",
      "In some ways, these Pacers are a throwback to their ABA roots \u2014 fast, high scoring, flurries of 3-pointers and made-for-television entertainment right down to the dance team.",
      "\u201cThe pace, it just fits who I am as a person, like the way I play the game,\u201d said Siakam, who won a championship ring with Toronto. \u201cWe have a lot of people who look down on us as an underdog and that's my style. I like that because that's been me my whole life.\u201d",
      "The Pacers will open as the underdog against the Thunder, the team George landed with all those years ago. Two former ABA powers, San Antonio and Denver, have won NBA titles. But if the Pacers can capture the Larry O'Brien trophy, they would be the league's only team to be crowned ABA and NBA champions.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to be popping champagne,\u201d said Carlisle, who led the Dallas Mavericks to the 2010-11 title. \u201cGetting to the NBA Finals is an accomplishment. But if you start looking at it that way, you'll go into it with the wrong mindset. When you get to this point of the season, its two teams, it's one goal so it becomes an all or nothing thing.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have unlocked one of the solar system's many secrets from an unexpected source: a planetarium show opening to the public on Monday.",

      "They were fine-tuning a scene featuring what's known as the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. Comets can hurtle toward Earth from the cloud, but scientists have never glimpsed its true shape.",
      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\u201cWhy is there a spiral there?\u201d said the museum's Jackie Faherty.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\u201d said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",

      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show, narrated by actor Pedro Pascal, features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker \u2014 including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",

      "Last spring, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And last fall, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major facelift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",
      "Severe storms are capable of scrambling radio and GPS communications.",
      "The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.",
      "Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.",
      "When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit.",
      "In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and caught telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.",
      "Space weather experts aren\u2019t able to predict a solar storm months in advance. Instead, they alert relevant parties to prepare in the days before a solar outburst hits Earth.",
      "Northern lights forecasts can be found on NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app.",
      "Consider aurora-watching in a quiet, dark area away from city lights. Experts recommend skygazing from a local or national park. And check the weather forecast because clouds can cover up the spectacle entirely.",
      "Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that aren\u2019t visible to the naked eye.",

      "It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all.",
      "Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought, with a 50-50 chance within the next 10 billion years. That\u2019s essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time.",
      "\u201cAs it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,\u201d the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy.",
      "While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity.",
      "\u201cWe likely won\u2019t live to see the benefit,\" lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email.",
      "Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn\u2019t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away.",
      "Sawala\u2019s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash.",
      "Past theories put a collision between the two \u2014 resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda \u2014 as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner.",
      "For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way's movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances.",
      "Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years.",
      "\u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study,",
      "A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy's name.",
      "More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what's happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos.",
      "While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\" according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\"",

      "The 19 people are all believed to have passed away from natural causes between 1871 and 1872 at Charity Hospital, which served people of all races and classes in New Orleans during the height of white supremacist oppression in the 1800s. The hospital shuttered following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.",

      "Scientists say 4 billion people, about half the world\u2019s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses, and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cAlthough floods and cyclones often dominate headlines, heat is arguably the deadliest extreme event,\u201d the report said. Many heat-related deaths are unreported or are mislabeled by other conditions like heart disease or kidney failure.",
      "The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries in the world, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change.",
      "Caribbean islands were among the hardest hit by additional extreme heat days. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, endured 161 days of extreme heat. Without climate change, only 48 would have occurred.",
      "\u201cIt makes it feel impossible to be outside,\u201d said Charlotte Gossett Navarro, chief director for Puerto Rico at Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit focused on social and environmental issues in Latino communities, who lives in the San Juan area and was not involved in the report.",
      "\u201cEven something as simple as trying to have a day outdoors with family, we weren\u2019t able to do it because the heat was too high,\" she said, reporting feeling dizzy and sick last summer.",
      "When the power goes out, which happens frequently in Puerto Rico in part because of decades of neglected grid maintenance and damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017, Navarro said it is difficult to sleep. \u201cIf you are someone relatively healthy, that is uncomfortable, it\u2019s hard to sleep ... but if you are someone who has a health condition, now your life is at risk,\u201d Gossett Navarro said.",
      "Heat waves are silent killers, said Friederike Otto, associate professor of climate science at Imperial College London, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fall dead on the street in a heat wave ... people either die in hospitals or in poorly insulated homes and therefore are just not seen,\u201d he said.",
      "Low-income communities and vulnerable populations, such as older adults and people with medical conditions, suffer the most from extreme heat.",
      "The high temperatures recorded in the extreme heat events that occurred in Central Asia in March, South Sudan in February and in the Mediterranean last July would have not been possible without climate change, according to the report. At least 21 people died in Morocco after temperatures hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) last July. People are noticing temperatures are getting hotter but don't always know it is being driven by climate change, said Roop Singh, head of urban and attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, in a World Weather Attribution statement.",
      "\u201cWe need to quickly scale our responses to heat through better early warning systems, heat action plans, and long-term planning for heat in urban areas to meet the rising challenge,\u201d Singh said.",
      "City-led initiatives to tackle extreme heat are becoming popular in parts of South Asia, North America, Europe and Australia to coordinate resources across governments and other agencies. One example is a tree-planting initiative launched in Marseille, France, to create more shaded areas.",
      "The report says strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient.",
      "But without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.",

      "Google will return to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department's attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it's navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power.",
      "The legal and technological threats facing Google are among the key issues that will be dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared as an illegal monopoly by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last year.",
      "Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers will attempt to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.",
      "Google lawyers are expected to assert only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice's four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.",
      "\u201cOver weeks of testimony, we heard from a series of well-funded companies eager to gain access to Google\u2019s technology so they don\u2019t have to innovate themselves,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t hear was how DOJ\u2019s extreme proposals would benefit consumers.\u201d",
      "After the day-long closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can't take until the judge orders a remedy.",
      "While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry's future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.",
      "The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won't rein in Google's power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that's the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.",
      "Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet's main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.",
      "The debate over Google's fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.",
      "Apple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department's proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn't compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.",
      "In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department's proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company's business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.",
      "The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department's proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry.",
      "Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realize their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. \u201cDevelopers will be overcome by uncertainty\u201d if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",
      "Buy Y Combinator, an incubator that has helped create hundreds of startups collectively worth about $800 billion filed documents pushing for the dramatic overhaul of Google, whose immense power has discouraged venture capitalists from investing in areas that are considered to be part of the company's \u201ckill zone.\u201d",
      "Startups \u201calso need to be able to get their products into the hands of users, free from restrictive dealing and self-preferencing that locks up important distribution channels. As things stand, Google has locked up the most critical distribution channels, freezing the general search and search text advertising markets into static competition for more than a decade,\u201d Y Combinator told Mehta.",

      "In a pristine corner of the Amazon, Brazilian and British scientists have spent more than two decades simulating drought to understand how the rainforest might respond to a drier future",
      "CAXIUANA NATIONAL FOREST, Brazil -- A short walk beneath the dense Amazon canopy, the forest abruptly opens up. Fallen logs are rotting, the trees grow sparser and the temperature rises in places sunlight hits the ground. This is what 24 years of severe drought looks like in the world\u2019s largest rainforest.",
      "But this patch of degraded forest, about the size of a soccer field, is a scientific experiment. Launched in 2000 by Brazilian and British scientists, Esecaflor \u2014 short for \u201cForest Drought Study Project\u201d in Portuguese\u2014 set out to simulate a future in which the changing climate could deplete the Amazon of rainfall. It is the longest-running project of its kind in the world, and has become a source for dozens of academic articles in fields ranging from meteorology to ecology and physiology.",
      "Understanding how drought can affect the Amazon, an area twice the size of India that crosses into several South American nations, has implications far beyond the region. The rainforest stores a massive amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. According to one study, the Amazon stores the equivalent of two years of global carbon emissions, which mainly come from the burning of coal, oil and gasoline. When trees are cut, or wither and die from drought, they release into the atmosphere the carbon they were storing, which accelerates global warming.",
      "To mimic stress from drought, the project, located in the Caxiuana National Forest, assembled about 6,000 transparent plastic rectangular panels across one hectare (2.5 acres), diverting around 50% of the rainfall from the forest floor. They were set 1 meter above ground (3.3 ft) on the sides to 4 meters (13.1 ft) above ground in the center. The water was funneled into gutters and channeled through trenches dug around the plot\u2019s perimeter.",
      "Next to it, an identical plot was left untouched to serve as a control. In both areas, instruments were attached to trees, placed on the ground and buried to measure soil moisture, air temperature, tree growth, sap flow and root development, among other data. Two metal towers sit above each plot.",
      "In each tower, NASA radars measure how much water is in the plants, which helps researchers understand overall forest stress. The data is sent to the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where it is processed.",
      "\u201cThe forest initially appeared to be resistant to the drought,\" said Lucy Rowland, an ecology professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "That began to change about 8 years in, however. \"We saw a really big decline in biomass, big losses and mortality of the largest trees,\u201d said Rowland.",
      "This resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the total weight of the vegetation and the carbon stored within it from the plot. The main findings were detailed in a study published in May in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. It shows that during the years of vegetation loss, the rainforest shifted from a carbon sink, that is, a storer of carbon dioxide, to a carbon emitter, before eventually stabilizing.",
      "There was one piece of good news: the decades-long drought didn\u2019t turn the rainforest into a savanna, or large grassy plain, as earlier model-based studies had predicted.",
      "In November, most of the 6,000 transparent plastic covers were removed, and now scientists are observing how the forest changes. There is currently no end date for the project.",
      "\u201cThe forest has already adapted. Now we want to understand what happens next,\u201d said meteorologist Jo\u00e3o de Athaydes, vice coordinator of Esecaflor, a professor at the Federal University of Para and coauthor of the Nature study. \u201cThe idea is to see whether the forest can regenerate and return to the baseline from when we started the project.\u201d",
      "During a visit in April, Athaydes guided Associated Press journalists through the site, which had many researchers. The area was so remote that most researchers had endured a full-day boat trip from the city of Belem, which will host the next annual U.N. climate talks later this year. During the days in the field, the scientists stayed at the Ferreira Penna Scientific Base of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, a few hundred yards (meters) from the plots.",
      "Four teams were at work. One collected soil samples to measure root growth in the top layer. Another gathered weather data and tracking soil temperature and moisture. A third was measured vegetation moisture and sap flow. The fourt focused on plant physiology.",
      "\"We know very little about how drought influences soil processes,\u201d said ecologist Rachel Selman, researcher at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Nature study, during a break.",
      "Esecaflor's drought simulation draws some parallels with the past two years, when much of the Amazon rainforest, under the influence of El Nino and the impact of climate change, endured its most severe dry spells on record. The devastating consequences ranged from the death of dozens of river dolphins due to warming and receding waters to vast wildfires in old-growth areas.",
      "Rowland explained that the recent El Nino brought short-term, intense impacts to the Amazon, not just through reduced rainfall but also with spikes in temperature and vapor pressure deficit, a measure of how dry the air is. In contrast, the Esecaflor experiment focused only on manipulating soil moisture to study the effects of long-term shifts in rainfall.",
      "\u201cBut in both cases, we\u2019re seeing a loss of the forest\u2019s ability to absorb carbon,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, along with the loss of forest cover.\u201d",

      "The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply",
      "NEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply.",
      "Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can\u2019t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits.",
      "The Associated Press\u2019 CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from the survey:",
      "The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.",
      "CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.",
      "The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.",
      "\u201c2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,\u201d said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.",
      "Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent \u201clong-overdue\u201d increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills.",
      "Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023.",
      "Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted.",
      "Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards.",
      "The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar.",
      "\u201cFor CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,\" said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. \"Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.\u201d",
      "Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is \u201cthat share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.\" But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a \u201cphenomenal rise\u201d in CEO compensation \u201ctracking recent years' market performance,\u201d which has \"widened the pay gap within workplaces.\"",
      "Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla\u2019s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle.",
      "Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30.",
      "At half the companies in AP\u2019s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company\u2019s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018.",
      "The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries.",
      "Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included.",
      "\u201cWith CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,\u201d Anderson said. \"These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value \u2013 they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.\u201d",
      "For the 27 women who made the AP survey \u2014 the highest number dating back to 2014 \u2014 median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts.",
      "The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.",
      "Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million).",
      "Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we\u2019re really not moving the needle significantly,\u201d she said.",
      "Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023.",
      "Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.",

      "A push in Texas to ban children under 18 years old from social media platforms is fading at the state Capitol",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A push in Texas to ban social media accounts for children under 18 faded Thursday after lawmakers did not take a key vote on creating one of the nation's toughest restrictions aimed at keeping minors off platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.",
      "The bill, which already passed the GOP-controlled state House, aims to go further than a Florida social media ban for minors under 14. Australia banned social media accounts for anyone under 16.",
      "But earlier momentum behind the Texas measure slowed at the eleventh hour in the state Senate as lawmakers face a weekend deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has not said publicly whether he supported the proposed ban, which was opposed by tech trade groups and critics who called it it an unconstitutional limit on free speech.",
      "\u201cThis bill was the best way to protect children in this state,\u201d state Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican carrying the measure, said Wednesday.",
      "The legislative session ends Monday. That leaves a narrowing path for the proposal that, if passed, would set up another test of state efforts to set boundaries on how and when children can access social media.",
      "Many tech companies have established a presence in Texas, including X, which is owned by Elon Musk.",
      "Earlier this week, Abbott signed into law a separate measure requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of online app store users, as well as parental consent to download apps and make in-app purchases for users under 18. Utah passed a similar bill earlier this year.",
      "The proposed Texas ban aimed at minors is the latest move in a growing bipartisan push nationwide to address the impacts of social media on the well-being of children.

Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",
      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records.

      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs.

      "Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human.",
      "The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward.",
      "But Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended \u2013 hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry\u2019s prospects.",
      "Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia\u2019s report for its fiscal first quarter.",
      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",
      "In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter.",
      "In a conference call with analysts, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lamented that the U.S. government had effectively blocked off AI chip sales to China \u2014 a market that he estimated at $50 billion. Huang warned the export controls have spurred China to build more of its own chips in a shift that he predicted the U.S. will eventually regret.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it\u2019s clearly wrong,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Despite Nvidia's lost opportunities in China, investors were heartened by the company's first-quarter performance. Nvidia's shares gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia\u2019s stock price ended Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology\u2019s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company's annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years.",
      "Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia\u2019s chips \u201cThere is one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution and it's Nvidia. That narrative is clear from these results,\u201d Ives wrote in a research note.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off other key markets besides China.",
      "In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia\u2019s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil.",
      "Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will always be Nvidia\u2019s largest market and home to the largest installed base of our infrastructure,\u201d Huang said. \u201cEvery nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution.\u201d",

      "Speaking at a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, Vance urged the crypto executives and enthusiasts to keep pressure on Congress to pass pro-crypto legislation supported by the White House.",
      "\u201cWe have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to unleash innovation and use it to improve the lives of countless American citizens,\u201d Vance said in his address. \u201cBut if we fail to create regulatory clarity now, we risk chasing this $3 trillion industry offshore in search of a friendly jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s speech comes after Trump promised to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d when he addressed the same bitcoin conference in Nashville last year in the middle of the presidential campaign. The crypto industry, which felt unfairly attacked by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump and pro-crypto lawmakers win election.",
      "Vance praised how quickly the crypto industry was able to organize and influence U.S. politics during last year\u2019s election, giving special credit to Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the billionaire founders of the crypto exchange Gemini.",
      "\u201cYou chose to speak up and you chose to get involved and I believe you changed the direct trajectory of our country because of it,\u201d Vance told the crowd gathered at the Venetian Hotel.",
      "Vance hailed crypto as a hedge that can help conservative populists protect themselves against bad politicians, overly aggressive regulators and unethical elites. He predicted its continued assimilation into the financial mainstream and said it was strategically important for the U.S. to be a world leader in the industry, noting that the Chinese government is hostile to crypto.",
      "Vance also touted the Trump administration\u2019s record at fulfilling the campaign promises made last year.",
      "As president, Trump has established a strategic bitcoin reserve for the federal government and pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, a black market website that was key to the early growth of bitcoin. Trump has also staked his administration with outspoken crypto backers while his administration has undone or paused several enforcement actions taken against large crypto companies.",
      "Several other Trump officials are speakers at the bitcoin conference, as are his sons Don Jr. and Eric. The president and his family\u2019s use of crypto as a platform to make money for the Trump brand has drawn criticism from Democrats and even crypto enthusiasts as corrupt and unseemly.",
      "The Trump family holds about a 60% stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that recently launched its own stablecoin, a fast-growing form of cryptocurrency whose values is often tied to the U.S. dollar. The U.S. Senate advanced legislation earlier this month that creates a federal framework to regulate stablecoins, a bill that Vance said the Trump administration wants passed into law quickly.",
      "Trump\u2019s media company announced Tuesday that it was raising $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, the world\u2019s oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. The president and the first lady have also launched their own meme coins, with Trump recently attending a dinner for some of his coins\u2019 biggest investors.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have identified a new pod of ancient hunter-gatherers who lived near the land bridge between North America and South America about 6,000 years ago.",
      "Researchers are still charting how human populations spread across the Americas thousands of years ago, arriving first in North America before veering south. Groups that split off developed their own collection of genes that scientists can use to piece together the human family tree.",
      "Discovered through ancient DNA, the group lived in the high plateaus of present-day Bogot\u00e1, Colombia \u2014 close to where the Americas meet. Scientists aren't sure exactly where they fall in the family tree because they're not closely related to ancient Native Americans in North America and also not linked to ancient or present-day South Americans.",
      "The new study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "\u201cUp to this point, we didn\u2019t believe there was any other lineage that would appear in South America,\" said archaeologist Andre Luiz Campelo dos Santos with Florida Atlantic University who was not involved with the new research. \u201cThis is unexpected.\u201d",
      "Just 4,000 years later, these ancient humans were gone and a genetically-different human clan inhabited the area. Scientists aren\u2019t sure exactly what happened to make them fade away \u2014 whether they mixed into a new, bigger group or were pushed out entirely.",
      "Analyzing more genes in South America will help confirm if this new group truly did disappear or if there could be evidence of their descendants elsewhere, said Campelo dos Santos.",

      "Some of the crypto\u2019s key characteristics help explain why wealthy individuals who hold a lot of digital assets can be ripe targets for such attacks.",
      "Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer traders full control of their funds without the need for a bank or permission from a government to buy, sell or hold it. The trade-off is that if funds are lost or stolen, there can be no way to get them back.",
      "Self-reliance is a key ethos of crypto. Securing and controlling one\u2019s private keys, which are like passwords used to access one\u2019s crypto holdings, is viewed as sacrosanct among many in the crypto community. A popular motto is \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d",

What\u2019s more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",

      "In a \"peace memorandum\" delivered to Ukraine's negotiating team on Monday, Russia set out similar maximalist demands to those issued during the opening days of its spring 2022 invasion.",
      "Among the demands are a Ukrainian withdrawal from all four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims -- Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk -- including areas that Russian troops do not occupy. Moscow said it would accept a ceasefire if Ukraine agreed to stop receiving foreign weapons and end mobilization -- two demands Kyiv has rejected.",
      "Moscow is also demanding limitations on the size of Ukraine's armed forces, a permanent block on Ukrainian NATO accession, international recognition of Russian control over the areas of Ukraine it claims, the lifting of all sanctions and Ukraine to abandon its demand for war reparations to be paid by Moscow.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Tuesday that there was no significant breakthrough during Monday's talks. \"It would be wrong to expect any immediate decisions or breakthroughs here,\" he said. \"But work is ongoing.\"",
      "A meeting between Putin, Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump \"is unlikely in the near future,\" Peskov continued.",
      "Dmitry Medvedev -- the former Russian president and prime minister now serving as the deputy chairman of the country's Security Council -- wrote on Telegram that the talks \"are not meant to achieve a compromise peace based on some imaginary and unrealistic conditions invented by others, but rather to secure our swift victory and the complete destruction\" of Zelenskyy's government.",
      "Zelenskyy on Tuesday said it is \"obvious: without global pressure -- without decisive actions from the United States, Europe, and everyone in the world who has the power -- Putin will not agree even to a ceasefire.\"",
      "\"Not a single day goes by without Russia striking Ukrainian cities and villages,\" the president continued.",
      "\"Every day, we lose our people to Russian terror. Every day, Russia gives new reasons for tougher sanctions and stronger support for our defense. I am grateful to everyone around the world who is promoting exactly this agenda: sanctions for aggression and the killing of people, and assistance in defending the lives of Ukrainians.\"",
      "Ukraine continued its own long-range strike campaign into Russia overnight. The Defense Ministry in Moscow said its forces downed eight Ukrainian drones on Monday night into Tuesday morning.",
      "Monday's Istanbul talks were held despite Ukraine's audacious covert operation targeting Russian strategic bombers on Sunday, in which drones concealed in the back of trucks attacked at least five airfields deep inside Russian territory.",

      "\"Unless they will stop, we will continue,\" he said.",
      "Asked whether he was satisfied with the Trump administration's involvement, Zelenskyy told Raddatz, \"We are looking for very strong steps on the part of President Trump to support the sanctions and to force President Putin to stop this war, or at least proceed with the first stage of putting an end to this war -- that is the ceasefire.\"",

      "U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year from 2.8% last year as President Donald Trump\u2019s erratic trade wars disrupt global commerce, drive up costs and leave businesses and consumers paralyzed by uncertainty",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year from 2.8% last year as President Donald Trump\u2019s erratic trade wars disrupt global commerce, drive up costs and leave businesses and consumers paralyzed by uncertainty.",
      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Tuesday that the U.S. economy \u2014 the world's largest \u2014 will slow further to just 1.5% in 2026. Trump\u2019s policies have raised average U.S. tariff rates from around 2.5% when he returned to the White House to 15.4%, highest since 1938, according to the OECD. Tariffs raise costs for consumers and American manufacturers that rely on imported raw materials and components.",
      "World economic growth will slow to just 2.9% this year and stay there in 2026, according to the OECD's forecast. It marks a substantial deceleration from growth of 3.3% global growth last year and 3.4% in 2023.",
      "The world economy has proven remarkably resilient in recent years, continuing to expand steadily \u2014 though unspectacularly \u2014 in the face of global shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But global trade and the economic outlook have been clouded by Trump's sweeping taxes on imports, the unpredictable way he's rolled them out and the threat of retaliation from other countries.",
      "Reversing decades of U.S. policy in favor of freer world trade, Trump has levied 10% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country on earth along with specific duties on steel, aluminum and autos. He's also threatened more import taxes, including a doubling of his tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%.",
      "Without mentioning Trump by name, OECD chief economist \u00c1lvaro Pereira wrote in a commentary that accompanied the forecast that \"we have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment.''",
      "Adding to the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s trade wars: A federal court in New York last week blocked most of Trump\u2019s tariffs, ruling that he\u2019d overstepped his authority in imposing them. Then an appeals court allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the taxes while appeals worked their way through the U.S. courts.",
      "China \u2014 the world's second-biggest economy \u2014 is forecast to see growth decelerate from 5% last year to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026. Chinese exporters will be hurt by Trump's tariffs, hobbling an economy already weakened by the collapse of the nation's real estate market. Some of the damage will be offset by help from the government: Beijing last month outlined plans to cut interest rates and encourage bank lending as well as allocating more money for factory upgrades and elder care, among other things.",
      "The 20 countries that share the euro currency will collectively see economic growth pick up from 0.8% last year to 1% in 2025 and 1.2% next year, the OECD said, helped by interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank.",
      "The Paris-based OECD, comprising 38 member countries, works to promote international trade and prosperity and issues periodic reports and analyses.",

    "story": [
      "Some Republican senators say they won\u2019t support bill that increases the deficit.",
      "As the Senate prepares to put its imprint on President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act this week, Republicans are grappling over the potential impact the megabill might have on the national debt, which has ballooned to nearly $37 trillion.",
      "With a 10-year budget bill, deficit hawks in the Senate like Rand Paul and Ron Johnson are drawing a red line -- pushing for deeper cuts than those in the bill the House sent to them.",
      "As lawmakers aim to send a bill to Trump by the Fourth of July, those demands could complicate the Senate's calculus for passage -- where Republicans can only afford three defections.",
      "On one hand, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduces outlays by more than $1.5 trillion against current baseline spending -- according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's preliminary analysis, meeting reconciliation's target for between $1.5 to $2 trillion in spending reductions.",
      "On the other hand, the bill still adds about $3.1 trillion to the debt, according to the CBO -- though some Republicans like Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky predict it could add up to $20 trillion to the debt over the next decade.",
      "At odds with the White House",
      "Paul and Johnson are directly at odds with the White House, which points to an analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisors that finds the legislation will save $1.6 trillion over 10 years.",
      "\"There's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a May 19 press briefing. \"That's the largest savings for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "In a press briefing on Thursday, Leavitt attacked the CBO and other scorekeepers, saying they used \"shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.\"",
      "The Senate is expected to alter the House-passed proposal and some of the Senate's fiscal hawks have conditioned their support on the implementation of even steeper cuts. But any cuts these members want implemented will have to be balanced by Senate leadership against the desires of moderates who wish to preserve key social safety net programs, creating major challenges for hopes of offsetting the cost of the package.",
      "Will the House and Senate see eye-to-eye?",
      "Another complication: any changes to the bill made by the Senate must be approved by the House, which narrowly sent the bill to the upper chamber by just one vote.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, who guided the bill through the House over the objections from both fiscal hard-liners and moderates in his conference, declared \"It's not going to add to the debt,\" when asked if Trump would take ownership of an increase of the deficit.",
      "And he said he and Trump has the same concerns as Johnson and Paul.",
      "\"He's also concerned as I am, as Ron Johnson is, as Rand Paul is, as all of us are about the nation's debt, and he and I talk about this frequently, and he is excited about changing that trajectory,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "The bill sent to the Senate would also hike the federal debt limit by $4 trillion dollars, another sticking point with fiscal hawks.",
      "\"There's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before,\" Paul said after the bill passed through the House two weeks ago. \"This will be the greatest increase in the debt ceiling ever, and the GOP owns this now.\"",
      "'Wimpy and anemic'",
      "At an event last week in Iowa, Paul repeated his disdain for the bill, calling the current cuts \"wimpy and anemic\" and suggesting that additional cutbacks could happen to entitlement programs like Medicaid and Social Security -- areas where a line has been drawn by Trump and fellow GOP senators like Josh Hawley of Missouri, who called building the bill on cutting health insurance for the working poor \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\"",
      "Paul told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that he thought there were enough votes among his Senate Republican colleagues to block the bill.",
      "\"I think there are four of us at this point, and I would be very surprised if the bill at least is not modified in a good direction,\" he said.",
      "Trump called Paul out over the weekend, writing on his Truth Social platform that if the senator votes against the bill, \"Rand will be playing right into the hands of the Democrats, and the GREAT people of Kentucky will never forgive him!\"",
      "Talking to reporters on Monday, Leavitt suggested there will be a price to pay for those who vote against it.",
      "\"Their voters will know about it. That is unacceptable to Republican voters and all voters across the country who elected this president in a Republican majority to get things done on Capitol Hill,\" she said.",
      "Budget reconciliation, the tactic congressional Republicans are using to get the bill passed, is not subject to the filibuster, enabling the Republican majority to enact sweeping changes with only a simple majority.",
      "But changes to Social Security and Medicare are exempt from the fast-track budgeting process. Any changes to those entitlements would require 60 votes and bipartisan cooperation from Democrats -- a prospect Republicans are not entertaining as they go it alone on the bill.",
      "Paul called for steeper spending cuts so that raising the debt limit would not be part of this bill. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called on Congress to increase the statutory debt limit by the end of July to prevent the country from defaulting on its debt obligations.",
      "\"I want [Trump's 2017] tax cuts to be permanent. But at the same time, I don't wanna raise the debt ceiling five trillion,\" he told CBS on Sunday. \"The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"",
      "Sen. Johnson, a notable fiscal hawk, has also signaled strongly that he would not support the bill in its current form, given that it adds to the debt.",
      "\"It's so far off the mark. It's so bad,\" he told reporters at the Capitol while the House was still advancing the bill through the Rules Committee. \"I've been trying to interject reality. I've been trying to interject facts and figures. They're on my side.\"",
      "Big or beautiful?",
      "At a Newsmaker luncheon Wednesday in Milwaukee hosted by WisPolitics and the Milwaukee Press Club, Johnson claimed there was \"no amount of pressure\" that Trump could place on him in order to support it in its current form.",
      "Asked Sunday on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" if he was willing to push so far as to blow up Trump's agenda, Johnson stressed his loyalty was with the American people.",
      "\"I want to see [Trump] succeed. But again, my loyalty is to the American people, to my kids and grandkids. We cannot continue to mortgage their future,\" Johnson said.",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who left the White House on Friday after his role as a special government employee reached its 130-day limit, broke publicly with the president during an interview with CBS a couple days earlier in which he said he was \"disappointed\" by the massive spending bill.",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk told CBS News, \"but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.\"",

    "summary": "Schiff again asks White House for disclosure of senior officials' financial transactions around Trump's sudden pause in April of his sweeping set of tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Schiff asked first in April over \"insider trading\" concerns amid tariffs pause.",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff in a letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles sent Monday, repeated his calls for the White House to issue a full disclosure of financial transactions from senior officials.",
      "The new ask comes after the California senator -- along with 25 other Democratic members of Congress -- sent a separate letter to Wiles in April that outlined his concern surrounding potential ethics violations, asking for a commitment from all senior White House and executive branch employees to \"expeditiously\" transmit all reports related to their securities transactions since the start of Trump's term to the Office of Government Ethics, and that the reports be made public.",
      "That April letter was sent in the wake of President Donald Trump's sudden pause that month of his sweeping set of tariffs, which triggered widespread concern from Schiff and other Democrats that those close to the president might have engaged in insider trading as markets rose following the pause.",
      "In his Monday letter, addressed to Wiles like the first but also including White House Counsel David Warrington, Schiff notes that senior executive White House officials are \u201cnow beyond the maximum allowable filing period for individuals who began their service at the outset of the Administration\u201d under federal ethics laws, which mandate that they file public annual financial disclosure documents, including a new entrant report, within 30 days of assuming their duties.",
      "\u201cThe White House has yet to disclose any financial disclosure or transaction reports, even after widespread concern of potential insider trading following President Trump's sudden pause of sweeping tariffs in early April,\u201d Schiff writes in the letter, first shared first with ABC News.",
      "\u201cAccording to OGE\u2019s disclosure database to date, no new entrant reports for any senior White House officials have been made available for public disclosure, despite legal requirements under the Ethics in Government Act and the clear public interest in the financial disclosures of senior executive branch leaders, raising questions as to whether the required public reports have yet to be submitted to OGE for certification,\u201d he added.",
      "Asked by ABC News for comment on the letter, White House spokesman Kush Desai said on Monday, \u201cThe American people remain highly concerned about Nancy Pelosi\u2019s long, documented history of insider trading and eagerly await Adam Schiff refocusing his political stunt on serious issues, like Pelosi\u2019s portfolio.\u201d",
      "Pelosi has faced allegations of trading on inside information during her time in Congress but has denied any impropriety.",
      "Copied on Schiff's letter is also Jamieson Greer, the acting director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, and Scott Gast, the ethics attorney in the White House counsel's office.",
      "In their April letter, the Democrats requested a response from Wiles no later than May 9, 2025, and for a \"detailed plan\" for how the administration plans to address any officials and employees who might have failed to file required disclosures from the start of the administration.",
      "A spokesperson for Schiff said that they received from the White House an acknowledgement that they had received the letter, but provided no answers to their demands.",
      "In the newest letter, Schiff asked for Wiles and Warrington to send, no later than on June 10, a list of all White House officials required to file new entrant reports; an explanation for the failure to transmit any new entrant reports to OGE for second-level review and certification; the current status and anticipated timeline for the submission and public posting of all overdue disclosures; a list of any filing extensions requested and granted by designated White House ethics officials and the duration of those extensions; and whether any late filing fees have been imposed for delinquent filings, as required by law.",
      "\u201cTransparency and compliance with ethics laws are essential. The American public deserves to know that those serving at the highest levels of government are free from financial conflicts of interest and have complied with the laws designed to safeguard the integrity of public service. I look forward to reviewing your responses,\u201d the senator concluded.",
      "Trump's tariffs have faced a number of court challenges. An appeals court reinstated Trump's tariffs this week after a Wednesday court order blocked them. The appeals court decision stands for the time being.",
      "The block on the tariffs came after the Court of International Trade decided that the administration's evocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give the president the right to set \"unlimited\" tariffs. The Trump administration argued that the court order may harm their progress in negotiations.",
      "Schiff has been a critic and target of Trump since his days in the House. Former President Joe Biden, during his last hours in office, issued a preemptive pardon for Schiff in connection with his work on the House's Jan. 6 select committee. Schiff has called that pardon \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cunwise.\u201d",

      "Ukraine staged a daring drone strike just before a new round of peace talks.",
      "As Ukraine and Russia exchanged intensifying attacks and held a second round of negotiations on Monday, the Trump administration has been notably quiet -- signaling a forewarned but subtle shift in the U.S. approach toward mediating the conflict.",
      "President Donald Trump had no immediate public reaction to Ukraine's dramatic drone strikes deep inside Russia -- just before Ukrainian and Russian delegations met face-to-face in Istanbul.",
      "The talks largely followed the format established by the Trump administration when representatives from both countries held a meeting in May for the first time since the early months of the war.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio was on hand for the initial discussions, which the U.S. quickly wrote off as a disappointment because Russia elected to send only a working-level group of diplomats to represent its interests at the negotiating table.",
      "But this time around, Rubio and other high-ranking Trump administration officials played an even smaller role in the talks and held even lower expectations.",
      "According to the State Department, Rubio held a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov where he \"reiterated President Trump's call for continued direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to achieve a lasting peace.\" However, the department noted in a readout of the conversation that the call was held at Lavrov's request.",
      "The second round of negotiations was brief and concluded without any major breakthrough.",
      "US disappointed but not surprised: Officials",
      "After the talks wrapped, U.S. officials told ABC News they were disappointed but not surprised by the substantial list of demands Russia said must be met before it would agree to a 30-day truce, saying it included a number of items both Ukraine and the Trump administration view as nonstarters -- calling it a clear attempt by Moscow to push off meaningful negotiations.",
      "Even before the latest talks, President Trump's frustration with the lack of progress toward peace has been building. Officials familiar with his thinking say that while he has previously lashed out at both Ukraine and Russia, he has grown increasingly disengaged in recent days.",
      "Trump has previously threatened to impose new sanctions on Moscow, but after the second round of talks concluded on Monday, there were no signs that the administration had taken any steps toward carrying out his threat.",
      "Even as negotiations sputter, the caliber of attacks launched by both Russia and Ukraine has intensified.",
      "In a coordinated operation on Sunday, Kyiv hit multiple airfields across with Russia with large-scale drone strikes -- a surprise attack that was the product of more than a year of planning and made possible by the covert positioning of smuggled drones deep within Russian territory.",
      "Ukraine has claimed that more than a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet was damaged or destroyed in the attacks. But beyond the hit to the Kremlin's military assets, the attacks are a symbolic victory for Kyiv -- proving it can still inflict pain on Moscow despite being outgunned and outmanned on the battlefield.",

      "\"We are looking for very for strong steps on the part of President Trump to support the sanctions and to force President Putin to stop this war, or at least proceed with the first stage of putting an end to this war -- that is the ceasefire,\" Zelenskyy said.",

      "Graham, a Putin critic, applauded Ukraine's drone warfare tactics and urged action against Russia in a post on X following the reports.",

      "Blumenthal also responded on X, urging a crackdown on Russia through the sanctions.",
      "\"When I visited President Zelenskyy & his team only a few days ago with @LindseyGrahamSC these extraordinary qualities of courage & capability were clearly evident. Russians have spread misinformation that they're winning. Time to pass our sanctions bill.\"",

      "\"The bill would put Russia on a trade island,\" Graham said. \"The consequences of its barbaric invasion must be made real to those that prop it up. If China or India stopped buying cheap oil, Mr. Putin's war machine would grind to a halt.\"",

      "\"We are in conversations with the White House, obviously, about that subject and that issue \u2026 there's a high level of interest here in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle and moving on it, and it's very well could be something that we would take up in this work period,\" Thune said. \"Obviously we're working with the White House to try and ensure that what we do and when we do it works well with the negotiations that they've got underway.\"",

      "\"Russia faces a stark choice: peace or crippling sanctions. President Trump has spoken forcefully of swift, severe consequences if Russia fails to honor a ceasefire. A bipartisan group of senators agrees,\" Barasso said.",

      "McCormick said he'd back the sanctions package because it continues to pressure Putin to engage in negotiations about ending the conflict.",
      "\"The only way to keep the pressure on is for things to happen like what happened today with Ukraine having a very successful military capability and operation, but in addition to that, the kinds of sanctions that are proposed in this legislation, and that is meant to help President Trump deliver on the vision and the deal he's talked about,\" McCormick said.",

      "J.D. Scholten, a Democratic Iowa state representative and professional baseball player, has entered the race to take on Republican Sen. Joni Ernst in 2026 -- prompted in part by her comments to constituents last week about potential cuts to Medicaid.",
      "Ernst faced a number of agitated constituents at a town hall on Friday who expressed concerns that Republican cuts to Medicaid in the bill that would fund Trump's legislative agenda. After one person in the audience shouted. \"People are going to die!\" Ernst responded, \"Well, we're all going to die.\"",
      "The incident \"really hit home with me,\" Scholten told ABC News in a brief interview. \"We need better leadership than that.\"",
      "On Saturday, Ernst posted a sarcastic \"apology\" for her comments in what appeared to be a cemetery, saying, \u201cI made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth. So I apologize, and I\u2019m really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well.\u201d",
      "Scholten has run for higher office before, coming within a few points of unseating far-right Rep. Steve King in 2018. He lost the 2020 race for King's old seat to Rep. Randy Feenstra by a wider margin and currently serves in the state house representing the Sioux City area.",
      "He is currently a pitcher for the Sioux City Explorers of the American Association of Baseball, an independent Major League Baseball partner league.",
      "Should he win the Democratic primary, Scholten said he also plans to make the race a referendum on President Donald Trump's trade policy, noting that Iowa soybean farmers have been caught up in the trade war with China.",
      "While some of Iowa's House seats are considered competitive in 2026, Democrats have not won a Senate race in the state since 2008.",

      "The bandleader\u2019s childhood family home marks the latest step in the State Historical Society of North Dakota\u2019s nearly completed goal of installing flush toilets at its dozen most popular, staffed sites. The most recent success, with the final three planned to be completed soon, came before the unveiling of a statue of Welk at a site that draws fans who recall \u201cThe Lawrence Welk Show,\u201d which ran on TV for decades starting in the 1950s.",
      "The North Dakota group's goal of replacing pit toilets with flush units may seem like a humble aspiration to some, but it's an important milestone, said Chris Dorfschmidt, a historic sites manager.",
      "\u201cA lot of our sites are kind of in the middle of nowhere. As I like to put it, history didn't happen where it's convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of that, if you've driven all the way out there, and that's the best we can do to kind of accommodate you, it's not the most pleasant experience.\u201d",
      "North Dakota has 60 state historic sites \u2014 everything from museums and an underground nuclear launch facility to plaques mounted on boulders in fields.",
      "\u201cAll of our sites, they really do help share a story of us as a state,\u201d Dorfschmidt said.",
      "Two other facilities are slated to be finished by June 30: at Whitestone Hill, the site of a deadly 1863 attack by U.S. troops against Native Americans; and Fort Buford, a military fort near the Missouri-Yellowstone river confluence.",
      "The Historical Society also is eyeing the Chateau de Mores for flush toilets. The wealthy Marquis de Mores built the 26-room home in 1883 near Medora, a present-day tourist town in the state's scenic Badlands where a young President Theodore Roosevelt once roamed.",
      "Less-visited sites that aren't staffed likely won't receive a restroom upgrade, which costs about $150,000 each.",
      "At the Welk Homestead, about 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) southeast of Bismarck, workers matched the color scheme of the restroom to the house and farm buildings, including interior colors.",
      "\u201cWe made it to fit into the site and harmonize with the site and just be a pleasant part of the experience,\u201d Historic Sites Manager Rob Hanna said.",

      "Immigration agents arrested Morales Reyes, 54, on May 21 after he dropped his child off at school in Milwaukee. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the arrest, saying he had written a letter threatening to kill Trump and would \u201cself-deport\u201d to Mexico. The announcement, which also was posted by the White House on its social media accounts, contained an image of the letter as well as a photo of Morales Reyes.",
      "But the claim started to unravel as investigators talked to Morales Reyes, who doesn't speak English fluently, and obtained a handwriting sample from him that was different than the handwriting in the letters, according to court documents.",

      "The president, who has golf clubs around the state and frequently stays at his Bedminster property, announced his endorsement for Ciattarelli last month.",
      "On Monday, Trump held a telephone rally for the candidate, a former state lawmaker who transformed from a critic to vocal backer of the president. The phone call lasted about 10 minutes, with the president saying that voters will decide whether New Jersey remains a \u201chigh-tax, high-crime sanctuary state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew Jersey is ready to pop out of that blue horror show and really get in there and vote for somebody that\u2019s going to make things happen,\u201d the president said.",
      "Trump's call for early voting echoed the pitch he made to voters in the 2024 presidential election.",

      "There is no legal definition for sanctuary city policies, but they generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.",
      "Ciattarelli also said the attorney general he appoints if he wins won't be bringing lawsuits against the White House. New Jersey's current attorney general has pursued several high-profile challenges to the president's agenda, including a case challenging Trump's order calling for the end of birthright citizenship.",
      "Ciattarelli is running against former radio talk host Bill Spadea, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac and a southern New Jersey contractor named Justin Barbera.",
      "Early in-person voting begins Tuesday and goes through Sunday. Primary day is June 10, though voters have been sending mail-in ballots in since late April.",
      "Though the primary isn't over, Ciattarelli hinted at what attacks against his eventual Democratic challenger in the general election might be, saying the party's eight years in the governorship and more than two decades of power in the legislature have been a failure.",
      "The Democratic field isn't set. There's a six-way contest between Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill; Mayors Ras Baraka of Newark and Steven Fulop of Jersey City; former state Senate President Steve Sweeney; and teacher's union president Sean Spiller.",
      "New Jersey tilts Democratic in presidential and Senate elections in particular, and the party has a roughly 800,000 voter registration advantage over Republicans.

      "President Donald Trump has appeared to undercut a proposal that was offered by his special envoy to Iran",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday appeared to undercut a proposal that was offered by his special envoy to Iran, saying he will insist that Tehran fully dismantle its nuclear enrichment program as part of any deal to ease crushing sanctions.",
      "Trump and Steve Witkoff, who is leading the negotiations for the U.S., have repeatedly offered inconsistent public messages about whether Iran would be allowed to retain the capacity to enrich uranium to lower levels for civilian purposes. The Trump administration maintains that it will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "The negotiations have been framed by Trump as both countries\u2019 best chance to avoid direct military conflict over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Tehran, which denies seeking a nuclear weapon, has insisted that it will not agree to any deal that fully scraps its enrichment program.",
      "\u201cUnder our potential Agreement \u2014 WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",
      "Addressing the seeming contradiction, a White House official said Trump was speaking the \u201ccold, hard truth.\u201d The official said the terms the U.S. gave the Iranians were \u201cvery tough\u201d and would make it impossible for them to obtain a nuclear bomb.",
      "Trump\u2019s post comes after media reports that Witkoff\u2019s latest proposal to Tehran would allow Iran to retain low levels of enrichment for civilian uses like nuclear medicine and commercial power if it agrees to shut down its heavily protected underground sites for a period of time. The U.S. and Iran have engaged in several rounds of direct nuclear talks for the first time in years.",
      "Senior officials \u2014 including Witkoff and Trump himself \u2014 have said within the last few weeks that Iran would not be able to keep enriching uranium at any level.",
      "The proposal, reported by Axios and confirmed by a U.S. official, called for the creation of a regional consortium to handle uranium enrichment for civilian uses \u2014 a plan first studied more than a decade ago in negotiations that led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.",
      "Trump was sharply critical of that agreement \u2014 which also allowed set limits on uranium enrichment but permitted Iran to maintain such a capacity \u2014 and withdrew the U.S. from it in 2017 during his first term.",
      "The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency found that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels since its last update in February, according to a confidential report released by the U.N. nuclear watchdog on Saturday.",
      "Iran has maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but Iranian officials have increasingly suggested that Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement before Trump's post. \"Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it\u2019s in their best interest to accept it. Out of respect for the ongoing deal, the Administration will not comment on details of the proposal to the media.\u201d",
      "The proposal that Trump appeared to undercut on Monday evening included significant concessions by the administration certain to anger Israel along with pro-Israel lawmakers in the United States.",
      "Several of the main points were essentially the same or very similar to conditions outlined in the 2015 nuclear deal.",
      "Early iterations of that agreement negotiated by the Obama administration also suggested the possibility of a regional consortium that would put Iranian uranium enrichment above a certain level under the control of Iran and its neighbors. The idea was scrapped, however, because of Gulf Arab nations\u2019 objections and Iranian suspicions of the ultimate aims of the consortium.",
      "People who were involved in the 18-month negotiations for the 2015 deal reacted immediately to reports that the Trump administration might allow Iran to continue with an enrichment program at any level, particularly after senior officials repeatedly said Iran would not be able to retain such programs.",
      "\u201cThis proposal poses a moment of truth for critics of previous Iran nuclear negotiations/agreements (and) those who have called for a no-enrichment, full-dismantlement deal,\u201d Dan Shapiro, Obama\u2019s former ambassador to Israel, wrote on X. \u201cWill they hold Trump to the same standard?\u201d",

A chaotic showdown unfolded outside as customers and witnesses shouted, smoke filled the air, and agents wore heavy tactical gear to face an angry crowd.",
      "Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, turned emotional when asked to explain why officials wear masks. He said some have received death threats and been harassed online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I\u2019m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, their family on the line because people don\u2019t like what immigration enforcement is,\u201d he said at a news conference in Boston to announce nearly 1,500 arrests in the region as part of a month-long \u201csurge operation.\u201d",

      "Lyons may have been referring to comments by San Diego Councilman Sean Elo-Rivera, who called ICE officers \u201cterrorists\u201d after Friday's restaurant raid. \u201cThis isn't safety. It's state-sponsored terrorism,\" Elo-Rivera wrote on Instagram.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security reposted Elo-Rivera's message, saying that likening ICE to terrorists was \u201csickening.\u201d The councilman stuck by his comments on Monday.",

      "\u201cFederal actions like these are billed as a public safety measure, but it had the complete opposite effect. What we saw undermines trust and creates fear in our community,\u201d Gloria said.",
      "ICE said Monday that the operation at Buona Forchetta, an anchor of San Diego's trendy South Park neighborhood, resulted in four arrests of people in the U.S. illegally. Authorities executed criminal search warrants for illegal hiring and making false statements when the crowd \u201cbecame unruly,\u201d prompting them to use flash-bang devices.",

A wound that is still raw, still echoing in our kitchens, our dining rooms, and our hearts.\u201d",
      "Lyons said in an interview on Fox & Friends Sunday that ICE was averaging about 1,600 arrests a day, a sharp increase from previous data that showed 78,155 arrests between Jan. 20 and May 19 \u2014 a daily average of 656. He said ICE can and will do more.",
      "Stephen Miller, the key architect of Trump's immigration policy, last week set a goal of 3,000 arrests a day and said the number could go higher. That pace would be a huge challenge with current funding. ICE housed an average of more than 46,000 detainees during the first half of May, already above its budgeted capacity.",

Homeland Security published a list of more than 500 sanctuary jurisdictions but removed it from its website after criticism that it contained inaccuracies, even from its allies.",

      "Three women are suing Baltimore\u2019s public school system, alleging they were sexually abused by a special education teacher decades ago",
      "BALTIMORE -- Three women are suing Baltimore\u2019s public school system, alleging they were sexually abused by a special education teacher decades ago while administrators failed to protect students from his predatory behavior.",
      "One of the plaintiffs was 14 when she alleges the teacher, whom the lawsuit names as Alvin Hunt, raped and impregnated her, according to the complaint.",
      "At a news conference Monday morning, attorneys for the women said school officials knew about the abuse and allowed it to continue. They said Hunt would lure students to his house under the pretense of after-school tutoring. The allegations contained in the lawsuits occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s.",
      "Attempts to reach Hunt were unsuccessful. A message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Baltimore City Public Schools.",
      "The lawsuits add to a growing pile of child sexual abuse claims filed in Maryland since the state eliminated its statute of limitations for such cases. Lawmakers approved the Child Victims Act in 2023 with abuse findings against the Catholic Church in mind, but its impacts have extended well beyond religious institutions. The state\u2019s juvenile justice system in particular is facing widespread reckoning after thousands of victims came forward.",
      "Pamela Coleman said she gave birth to Hunt\u2019s daughter after he drugged and raped her. Hunt offered the teen a ride home from school and gave her a cigarette laced with an illicit substance that caused her to lose consciousness, her complaint says.",
      "\u201cMy childhood and teen years was just ripped from me,\u201d Coleman said at the news conference. She said her mother reported the abuse and administrators transferred her to another school after learning she was pregnant.",
      "The AP doesn\u2019t typically identify victims of abuse unless they want to be named.",
      "Attorneys said Hunt, who was also a sports coach, never faced prosecution or accountability for his actions. Instead, he retired from the school system after a long career. He is not named as a defendant in the lawsuits, which were filed against the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners.",
      "\u201cThis abuse was not just known, it was normalized,\u201d said attorney Janai Woodhouse with the Baltimore law firm Murphy, Falcon & Murphy. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t hidden. It was tolerated.\u201d",
      "She said the Child Victims Act allows abuse survivors the time they need to come forward, often decades later. Before its passage, victims couldn\u2019t sue after they turned 38.",
      "The three plaintiffs were young and vulnerable when they were abused by someone they trusted, their attorneys said.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the amount of psychological trauma that was inflicted here. So it took some time,\u201d Woodhouse said. \u201cBut they gathered the courage to come to us and they\u2019re ready to seek justice now.\u201d",
      "According to the lawsuit filed on behalf of Collette Lee, she went to Hunt\u2019s house for tutoring with another special education student. He cornered her and tried to assault her, but she says she managed to escape.",
      "\u201cI was able to run,\u201d she said during the news conference. \u201cI\u2019ve been running for a long time. I\u2019m tired. I want justice.\u201d",
      "The lawsuits were filed Friday in state court. The plaintiffs are seeking punitive damages.",

      "The U.S. Department of Energy is ordering an oil and gas power plant to keep its turbines running through the hottest summer months as a precaution against electricity shortfalls in the mid-Atlantic grid",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The U.S. Department of Energy has ordered another power plant, this time an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania, to keep its turbines running through the hottest summer months as a precaution against electricity shortfalls in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "The department's order to the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, regarding the Eddystone power plant just south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River, is the department's second use of federal power under President Donald Trump to require a power plant to keep operating on the mainland United States.",
      "Constellation Energy had planned to shut down Eddystone's units 3 and 4 on Saturday, but Trump's Department of Energy ordered the company to continue operating the units until at least Aug. 28. The units can produce a combined 760 megawatts.",
      "The department, in its order, cited PJM's growing concerns about power shortfalls amid the shutdown of aging power plants and rising electricity demand.",
      "PJM last year approved Constellation's request to shut down the units, but it welcomed the department's order to keep them operating, saying it's a \u201cprudent, term-limited step\u201d that allows PJM, the department and Constellation to study the longer-term need and viability of Eddystone's units.",
      "The department took a similar step last week, ordering Consumers Energy to keep the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant open in Michigan past its Saturday retirement.",
      "The grid operator there, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, said the order was unnecessary, that there was no energy emergency there and that there should be enough energy in the region through the summer.",
      "An environmental advocacy group, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, criticized the move to keep Eddystone operating as an \"environmental injustice.\" Shutting down the units would reduce hazardous pollution and carbon emissions from the decades-old facility and help the region meet federal clean air standards for smog, it said.",

      "Authorities say a man used a flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into a group holding one of its regular rallies in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza. Eight people were injured, some with burns.",
      "Shavuot (pronounced Shah-voo-OTE), Hebrew for \u201cweeks,\" has been observed since biblical times. It marks the passing of seven weeks (49 days) from the holiday of Passover, with Shavuot falling on the 50th day.",
      "In biblical times, Shavuot was an agricultural festival, when Israelites would bring harvest offerings to the temple.",
      "Today, it's primarily commemorated as the traditional date on which God gave the Torah \u2014 the law that forms the heart of the Jewish Scriptures \u2014 to Moses on Mount Sinai, as described in the Bible.",

      "For Jews inside Israel and for Reform Jews, the festival lasts for one day. Other traditions outside of Israel observe Shavuot for two days, ending Tuesday evening this year. (The variation stems from different traditions on when to observe lunar holidays, which historically were based on moon observations in ancient Israel.)",
      "Shavuot typically falls in May or June on the Gregorian calendar.",
      "Jews celebrate with readings of the biblical book of Exodus, including the Ten Commandments. Some mark the occasion with all-night readings from the Torah and other religious texts. Observant Jews refrain from work on Shavuot. The biblical book of Ruth, about a woman who embraces the Jewish faith, is often read and studied.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A split Supreme Court on Monday rejected a pair of gun rights cases, though one conservative justice predicted the court would soon consider whether assault weapons bans are constitutional.",
      "The majority did not explain its reasoning in turning down the cases over high-capacity magazines and state bans on guns like the AR-15, popular weapons that have also been used in mass shootings.",
      "But three conservative justices on the nine-member court publicly noted their disagreement, and a fourth said he is skeptical that assault-weapons bans are constitutional.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have taken a case challenging Maryland's ban, and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to say the law likely runs afoul of the Second Amendment.",
      "\u201cI would not wait to decide whether the government can ban the most popular rifle in America,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cThat question is of critical importance to tens of millions of law-abiding AR\u201315 owners throughout the country.\u201d",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the decision to pass on the case now but indicated that he is skeptical such bans are constitutional and that he expects the court will address the issue \u201cin the next term or two.\u201d",
      "The Maryland law was passed after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults. The shooter was armed with an AR-15, one of the firearms commonly referred to as an assault weapon.",
      "Several states have similar measures, and congressional Democrats have also supported the concept. The challengers had argued that people have a constitutional right to own the firearms like the AR-15, which most gun owners use legally.",
      "The case comes nearly three years after the high court handed down a landmark ruling that expanded Second Amendment rights and spawned challenges to firearm laws around the country.",
      "Ten states and the District of Columbia have similar laws, covering major cities like New York and Los Angeles. Congress allowed a national assault weapons ban to expire in 2004.",
      "The gun control group Everytown Law applauded the high court's action, saying the measures make communities safer. \u201cWe will fight to ensure the courts continue to uphold these life-saving laws,\u201d said Janet Carter, managing director of Second Amendment litigation.",
      "More than twice as many people died in mass shootings in which large-capacity magazines and assault weapons were used between 2015 and 2022, the group said.",
      "Attorneys for Maryland argued the guns aren\u2019t protected by the Constitution because they\u2019re similar to military-grade weapons. The law bans dozens of firearms \u2014 including the AR-15, the AK-47 and the Barrett .50-caliber sniper rifle \u2014 and puts a 10-round limit on gun magazines.",
      "The gun rights group Second Amendment Foundation said it has seven other cases challenging the bans and plans to continue to \u201caggressively litigate\u201d them. \u201cMillions of Americans continue to be disenfranchised from exercising their complete Second Amendment rights by virtue of these categorical bans,\u201d Executive Director Adam Kraut said.",
      "The high court also rebuffed a bid to overturn state bans on high-capacity gun magazines in a case out of Rhode Island. Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch said they would have heard the case. More than a dozen states have similar laws limiting the amount of ammunition a magazine can hold.",
      "Thomas and Kavanaugh have previously expressed skepticism about assault weapon bans.",
      "As an appeals court judge in 2011, Kavanaugh wrote a dissent saying that a similar measure in Washington, D.C., was unconstitutional. Thomas, meanwhile, dissented in 2015 when the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to a municipal ban on AR-15-style weapons, writing that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of people who owned the weapons used them for lawful purposes like self-defense.",
      "The high court in 2022 handed down a ruling that expanded gun rights and told lower-court judges they should no longer consider factors like public safety in deciding whether firearm laws are constitutional. Instead, they should focus on whether a law fits into the nation\u2019s historic tradition of gun ownership, the court said.",
      "That led to a flurry of challenges to gun laws around the country, multiple restrictions struck down, and confusion among lower-court judges over what gun laws can stay on the books.",
      "Since then, the Supreme Court has overturned a ban on rapid-fire gun accessories called bump stocks but upheld a law barring people under domestic-violence restraining orders from having guns and regulations on nearly untraceable ghost guns.",

Police said the victims suffered \u201cvarying types of injuries.\u201d All of the injured were men between the ages of 26 and 57, police said.",

      "Williams was traveling by bus from Portland to Deschutes County when he got off in Salem on Saturday, according to Salem Police Violent Crimes Unit detectives. He visited the shelter on Saturday but didn't stay overnight, shelter officials said. The next night, Williams arrived at the shelter shortly before the call for police assistance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in disbelief that something like this could happen. We are most concerned with those who are still in hospital and for those who were just there. It\u2019s a difficult thing to process,\u201d Salem Mayor Julie Hoy said.",

      "Up to 150 men seek refuge at the shelter each night, according to its website.",
      "Caleb Rennie, 19, was driving that stretch of road as he does every day and saw the arrest in progress so started recording it with his cellphone.",
      "\u201cTwo cops had their guns drawn when they were running across the street, so that kind of helped me understand the gravity of the situation and that's also why I started recording,\u201d Rennie said.",

      "Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into the crowd",
      "BOULDER, Colo. -- Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd. The FBI immediately described the violence as a \u201ctargeted terror attack.\u201d",
      "The suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d during the Sunday attack on the group of demonstrators, said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Denver field office.",
      "Soliman was arrested and taken to the hospital for treatment, but authorities didn\u2019t elaborate on his injuries.",
      "Here is what we know about the attack:",
      "Authorities said the attacker targeted demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run for Their Lives, which organizes run and walk events to call for the immediate release of the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza since they were captured by militants during the incursion into southern Israel that started the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.",
      "The group had gathered at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and students.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war has inflamed global tensions and contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. A week earlier, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot to death in Washington by a man who yelled \u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza\u201d as he was being led away by police.",
      "Police in Boulder evacuated multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear.",
      "The violence occurred four years after 10 people were killed a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.",
      "The people injured in the Pearl Street attack range in age from 52 to 88.",
      "Photos from the scene showed a woman lying on the ground in the fetal position with her hair soaked, and a man helping her and getting water from someone with a water jug.",
      "The injuries authorities found were consistent with reports of people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said, adding that injuries ranged from serious to minor.",
      "Redfearn told reporters Sunday evening that it was too early to discuss a motive but that witnesses were being interviewed.",
      "\u201cIt would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on,\u201d he said.",
      "Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene. No charges were immediately announced, but officials said they expect to hold him \u201cfully accountable.\u201d",
      "Video from the scene showed him shirtless and wearing jeans and holding two clear bottles with a transparent liquid in them while shouting at onlookers.",
      "Another video shows a witness shouting, \u201cHe\u2019s right there. He\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails,\u201d as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect.",
      "FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism, and the Justice Department \u2014 which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations \u2014 decried the attack as a \u201cneedless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,\u201d FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.",

      "An attorney for Harvey Weinstein says he doesn't plan to testify in his New York sex crimes retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein doesn't plan to testify at his New York sex crimes retrial, his lawyer said Sunday. That means jurors soon will get the case against the former movie studio boss who propelled the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct.",
      "The trial will move on to closing arguments Tuesday without testimony from Weinstein, Arthur Aidala said Sunday night. The court handles other cases on Mondays.",
      "It's unclear whether jury deliberations would begin Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday.",
      "It was a fraught decision for Weinstein, who didn\u2019t testify at previous trials in New York and California and was convicted in both. He denies the allegations, and Aidala has said that Weinstein was carefully weighing whether to take the stand this time.",
      "While his California appeal winds on, Weinstein won a new trial in his New York rape and sexual assault case when the state\u2019s highest court overturned his 2020 conviction.",
      "He's charged in New York with raping Jessica Mann in 2013 and forcing oral sex on Miriam Haley and Kaja Sokola, separately, in 2006. Mann was an actor and hairstylist, Haley a production assistant and producer, and Sokola a model who aspired to an acting career.",
      "All three women testified for days at the retrial, giving emotional and graphic accounts of what they say they endured. They said Weinstein suggested he'd help them achieve their show-business dreams, but then maneuvered them into private settings and preyed on them.",
      "His attorneys have argued that anything that happened between him and his accusers was consensual.",
      "In the U.S., defendants in criminal cases aren't obligated to testify, and many decide not to, for various reasons. Among them: the prospect of being questioned by prosecutors.",
      "Weinstein has been watching the New York retrial intently from the defense table, sometimes shaking his head at accusers\u2019 testimony and often leaning over to one or another of his attorneys to convey his thoughts.",
      "Aidala said outside court Thursday that Weinstein thought a lot of holes had been poked in the accusers' accounts, but that he also was pondering whether jurors would feel they needed to hear from him.",
      "The jury has heard from a few other defense witnesses \u2014 one of them via a transcript read by court employees.",
      "That witness, Talita Maia, testified at the 2020 trial but was unavailable this time, so jurors instead got a reading Friday of her earlier testimony. One court stenographer voiced the 2020 attorneys' questions, while another stenographer sat in the witness box and rendered Maia's answers, at times with emphasis.",
      "Maia and Mann were roommates and friends in 2013 but later fell out. According to Maia, Mann never mentioned in those days that Weinstein had hurt her in any way. Both Maia and another witness, Thomas Richards, met up with Mann and Weinstein shortly after Mann has said she was raped.",
      "Both witnesses testified that they saw nothing amiss.",
      "Mann testified earlier this month that she never anyone at the time that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her because she didn't think she'd be believed, and she was scared about how he might react.",
      "Weinstein's defense also brought in former Sokola pal Helga Samuelsen, who has friendly ties to the former producer. Samuelsen testified Thursday that Weinstein visited Sokola once and spent about a half-hour in a bedroom with her in a New York apartment the women briefly shared in 2005; Sokola told jurors no such thing happened.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Sokola, Mann and Haley have given their permission to be identified.",

      "A list of more than 500 \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d no longer appears in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s website after receiving criticism for including localities that have actively supported the Trump administration\u2019s hard-line immigration policies",
      "WASHINGTON -- A widely anticipated list of \u201c sanctuary jurisdictions\u201d no longer appears on the Department of Homeland Security's website after receiving widespread criticism for including localities that have actively supported the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies.",
      "The department last week published the list of the jurisdictions. It said each one would receive formal notification the government deemed them uncooperative with federal immigration enforcement and whether they\u2019re believed to be in violation of any federal criminal statutes.",
      "The list was published Thursday on the department\u2019s website but on Sunday there was a \u201cPage Not Found\" error message in its place.",
      "The list was part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to target communities, states and jurisdictions that it says aren\u2019t doing enough to help its immigration enforcement agenda and the promises the president made to deport more than 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal authorization.",
      "The list is being constantly reviewed and can be changed at any time and will be updated regularly, a DHS senior official said.",
      "\u201cDesignation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\u201d the official said in a statement.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that there had been anger from some officials about the list. However, she didn\u2019t address why it was removed.",
      "\u201cSome of the cities have pushed back,\u201d Noem said. \u201cThey think because they don\u2019t have one law or another on the books that they don\u2019t qualify, but they do qualify. They are giving sanctuary to criminals.\u201d",
      "The list, which was riddled with misspellings, received pushback from officials in communities spanning from urban to rural and blue to red who said the list doesn\u2019t appear to make sense.",
      "In California, the city of Huntington Beach made the list even though it had filed a lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s immigration sanctuary law and passed a resolution this year declaring the community a \u201cnon-sanctuary city.\u201d",
      "Jim Davel, administrator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, said the inclusion of his community must have been a clerical error. Davel voted for Trump as did 67% of Shawano County.",
      "Davel thinks the administration may have confused the county\u2019s vote in 2021 to become a \u201cSecond Amendment Sanctuary County\u201d that prohibits gun control measures with it being a safe haven for immigrants. He said the county has approved no immigration sanctuary policies.",

      "Tulsa\u2019s new mayor on Sunday proposed a $100 million private trust as part of a reparations plan to give descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre scholarships and housing help",
      "TULSA, Okla. -- Tulsa's new mayor on Sunday proposed a $100 million private trust as part of a reparations plan to give descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre scholarships and housing help in a city-backed bid to make amends for one of the worst racial attacks in U.S. history.",
      "The plan by Mayor Monroe Nichols, the first Black mayor of Oklahoma's second-largest city, would not provide direct cash payments to descendants or the last two centenarian survivors of the attack that killed as many as 300 Black people. He made the announcement at the Greenwood Cultural Center, located in the once-thriving district of North Tulsa that was destroyed by a white mob.",
      "Nichols said he does not use the term reparations, which he calls politically charged, characterizing his sweeping plan instead as a \u201croad to repair.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor 104 years, the Tulsa Race Massacre has been a stain on our city's history,\u201d Nichols said Sunday after receiving a standing ovation from several hundred people. \u201cThe massacre was hidden from history books, only to be followed by the intentional acts of redlining, a highway built to choke off economic vitality and the perpetual underinvestment of local, state and federal governments.",
      "\u201cNow it's time to take the next big steps to restore.\u201d",
      "Nichols said the proposal wouldn't require city council approval, although the council would need to authorize the transfer of any city property to the trust, something he said was highly likely.",
      "The private charitable trust would be created with a goal to secure $105 million in assets, with most of the funding either secured or committed by June 1, 2026. Although details would be developed over the next year by an executive director and a board of managers, the plan calls for the bulk of the funding, $60 million, to go toward improving buildings and revitalizing the city's north side.",
      "\u201cThe Greenwood District at its height was a center of commerce,\u201d Nichols said in a telephone interview. \u201cSo what was lost was not just something from North Tulsa or the Black community. It actually robbed Tulsa of an economic future that would have rivaled anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Nichols' proposal follows an executive order he signed earlier this year recognizing June 1 as Tulsa Race Massacre Observance Day, an official city holiday. Events Sunday in the Greenwood District included a picnic for families, worship services and an evening candlelight vigil.",
      "Nichols also realizes the current national political climate, particularly President Trump's sweeping assault on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, poses challenging political crosswinds.",
      "\u201cThe fact that this lines up with a broader national conversation is a tough environment,\u201d Nichols admitted, \u201cbut it doesn't change the work we have to do.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline Weary, is a granddaughter of massacre survivor John R. Emerson, Sr., who owned a hotel and cab company in Greenwood that were destroyed. She acknowledged the political difficulty of giving cash payments to descendants. But at the same time, she wondered how much of her family's wealth was lost in the violence.",
      "\u201cIf Greenwood was still there, my grandfather would still have his hotel,\u201d said Weary, 65. \u201cIt rightfully was our inheritance, and it was literally taken away.\u201d",
      "Tulsa is not the first U.S. city to explore reparations. The Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, was the first U.S. city to make reparations available to its Black residents for past discrimination, offering qualifying households $25,000 for home repairs, down payments on property, and interest or late penalties on property in the city. The funding for the program came from taxes on the sale of recreational marijuana.",
      "Other communities and organizations that have considered providing reparations range from the state of California to cities including Amherst, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Asheville, North Carolina; and Iowa City, Iowa; religious denominations like the Episcopal Church; and prominent colleges like Georgetown University in Washington.",
      "In Tulsa, there are only two living survivors of the Race Massacre, both of whom are 110 years old: Leslie Benningfield Randle and Viola Fletcher. The women, both of whom were in attendance on Sunday, received direct financial compensation from both a Tulsa-based nonprofit and a New York-based philanthropic organization, but have not received any recompense from the city or state.",
      "Damario Solomon-Simmons, an attorney for the survivors and the founder of the Justice for Greenwood Foundation, said earlier this year that any reparations plan should include direct payments to Randle and Fletcher and a victims' compensation fund for outstanding claims.",
      "A lawsuit filed by Solomon-Simmons on behalf of the survivors was rejected by the Oklahoma Supreme Court last year, dampening racial justice advocates' hopes that the city would ever make financial amends.",

      "Two U.S. senators are warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling on peace while preparing a fresh military offensive against Ukraine",
      "PARIS -- Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine, two senior U.S. senators warned Sunday, arguing that the next two weeks could shape the future of a war that has already smashed cities, displaced millions and redrawn Europe\u2019s security map.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to The Associated Press in Paris after meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and touring neighborhoods shattered by what they called the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began.",
      "In Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 who they say is \u201c100% aligned\u201d with them on the war \u2014 the senators warned the window to prevent a renewed assault is closing.",
      "A sweeping U.S. sanctions bill could be the West\u2019s last chance to choke off the Kremlin\u2019s war economy, they said \u2014 adding that they hope their firsthand findings will shift momentum in Washington and help bring a skeptical President Donald Trump on board.",
      "\"What I learned on this trip was he\u2019s preparing for more war,\u201d Graham said of Putin. Blumenthal called the sanctions proposed in legislation \u201cbone-crushing\u201d and said it would place Russia\u2019s economy \u201con a trade island.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is crunch time for Putin and for the world because Russia is mounting a new offensive,\u201d he said.",
      "At the heart of their push is a bipartisan sanctions bill, backed by nearly the entire U.S. Senate but still facing uncertain odds in Washington. It would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports \u2014 targeting nations like China and India that account for roughly 70% of Russia\u2019s energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort.",
      "Graham called it \u201cthe most draconian bill I\u2019ve ever seen in my life in the Senate.\"",
      "\u201cThe world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.\u201d",
      "With peace talks yielding little and Trump's approach to Ukraine highly uncertain, Graham and Blumenthal have stepped into the breach \u2014 blunt emissaries on a lonely mission. Political opposites moving in lockstep, they\u2019re crossing Europe, and the aisle, with the moral urgency of two men trying to forestall another Russian offensive before it\u2019s too late.",
      "Peace talks are scheduled to resume Monday in Istanbul. But Ukrainian officials say Moscow has yet to submit a serious proposal \u2014 a delay both senators described as deliberate and dangerous.",
      "\u201cPutin is playing President Trump,\" Blumenthal said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking him for a sucker.\u201d The senator said Putin \"is, in effect, stalling and stonewalling, prolonging the conversation so that he can mount this offensive and take control of more territory on the ground.\u201d",
      "Graham added: \u201cWe saw credible evidence of a summer or early fall invasion, a new offensive by Putin. ... He\u2019s preparing for more war.\u201d",
      "Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill, telling reporters Friday: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to see it.\u201d Graham said the legislation was drafted in consultation with Trump\u2019s advisers.",
      "Graham backed the president\u2019s diplomatic instincts but said, \"By trying to engage Putin \u2014 by being friendly and enticing \u2014 it\u2019s become painfully clear he\u2019s not interested in ending this war.\u201d",
      "Blumenthal hoped the bipartisan support for Ukraine at least in the Senate \u2014 and the personal testimonies they plan to bring home to Congress and the Oval Office\u2014 may help shift the conversation.",
      "\u201cHe needs to see and hear that message as well from us, from the American people,\u201d he said of Putin.",
      "In Kyiv, the senators said, the war\u2019s human toll was impossible to ignore. Graham pointed to what Ukrainian officials and Yale researchers estimate are nearly 20,000 children forcibly deported to Russia \u2014 calling their return a matter of justice, not diplomacy.",
      "Blumenthal described standing at mass grave sites in Bucha, where civilians were executed with shots to the head. The destruction, he said, and the stories of those who survived, made clear the stakes of delay. \u201cPutin is a thug. He\u2019s a murderer.\"",
      "Both said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later. If Putin isn\u2019t stopped in Ukraine, Blumenthal said, NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle.",
      "After a one-hour meeting with Macron in Paris, both Graham, of South Carolina, and Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said they left convinced Europe was ready to toughen its stance.",
      "\u201cThis visit has been a breakthrough moment because President Macron has shown moral clarity in his conversations with us,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cToday, he is 100% aligned with that message that we are taking back to Washington.\u201d",
      "Blumenthal pointed to the rare bipartisan unity behind the sanctions bill. \u201cThere are very few causes that will take 41 Republicans and 41 Democrats and put them on record on a single piece of legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cause of Ukraine is doing it.\u201d",
      "Ahead, Ukrainian military leaders are set to brief Congress and a sanctions vote could follow.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump said we\u2019ll know in two weeks whether he\u2019s being strung along,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThere will be more evidence of that from Russia on Monday.\u201d",

      "\u201cI feel that people\u2019s faith is so strong here,\u201d student Logan Nelson said of the dedicated Catholic space where he attends daily Mass. \u201cIt feels like a home \u2014 even more so than my own house.\u201d",
      "The Gothic university chapel was built in 1928. At the time, Princeton says, its capacity to seat more than 2,000 people was second in size only to King\u2019s College Chapel at Cambridge University.",
      "Today, the chapel hosts interfaith services, concerts and weddings throughout the academic year and is known by the university as \u201cthe bridge between town and gown.\u201d",
      "On May 8, Catholic students were worshipping as usual at daily Mass in the side chapel when the service was interrupted by news alerts on their phones. In the Vatican, white smoke billowed from the Sistine Chapel, indicating that a new leader of their faith had been elected.",
      "The Rev. Zachary Swantek, Princeton\u2019s Catholic chaplain, told the group to gather at the Catholic Ministry office. Together, they watched on TV as the election of the first U.S.-born pope was announced.",
      "\u201cIt was electric,\u201d Nelson said, adding there was \u201cuproar\u201d in the room when Chicago-born Cardinal Robert Prevost \u202fbecame the 267th pontiff. \u201cIt was so cool to see an American pope.\u201d",
      "Like other members of the Catholic ministry, he is hopeful that Pope Leo XIV will help bring a revival for Catholicism in America.",
      "\u201cI feel that there\u2019s a resurgence of Catholicism today,\u201d said Nelson, who was religiously unaffiliated until last year when he converted to Catholicism. \u201cYou see people who are passionate about their faith. There\u2019s a new wave coming, and we\u2019re going to have more converts like me, who are coming from the 'nones.\u2019\u201d",
      "Across much of the world, the number of people who are nonbelievers or unaffiliated with any organized religion has dramatically increased over the years.

    "story": [
      "Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg and 11 other activists set sail for the Gaza Strip on Sunday afternoon, aboard a ship carrying aid. The mission is aimed at \"breaking Israel's siege\" of the devastated territory, organizers said.",
      "\"Game of Thrones\" actor Liam Cunningham and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, are also among the crew. Hassan has been barred from entering Israel due to her active opposition to the Israeli assault on Gaza.",
      "The sailing boat Madleen \u2014 operated by activist group Freedom Flotilla Coalition \u2014 departed from the Sicilian port of Catania, in southern Italy.",
      "\"'Madleen' sails to Gaza today with twelve humanitarians and as much life-saving aid as she can carry, including baby formula, medical supplies, and more. She departs from European territorial waters, sailing entirely through international waters into Palestinian waters off Gaza,\" the coalition wrote\u00a0in a social media post Sunday. \"Unarmed and nonviolent, 'Madleen' poses no threat. She sails in full accordance with international law. Any attack or interference will be a deliberate, unlawful assault on civilians.\"",
      "As the crew tries to reach the shores of Gaza, they hope their trip will raise \"international awareness\" over the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the activists said at a press conference on Sunday, ahead of departure.",
      "\"We are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying,\" Thunberg said, bursting into tears during her speech.",
      "\"Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it's not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the live-streamed genocide,\" she added.",
      "Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic \"blood libel.\"",
      "In mid-May, Israel slightly eased its blockade of Gaza after nearly three months, allowing a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the territory.",
      "Experts have warned that Gaza is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped.",
      "Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month.",
      "That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group's vessels, the \"Conscience,\" was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.",
      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",
      "The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza's civilians.",
      "\"We are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that's part of a broader strategy of mobilizations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,\" said activist Thiago Avila.",

    "summary": "Former President Bill Clinton and author James Patterson have teamed up for their third book, a thriller: \"The First Gentleman,\" in which the commander-in-chief is a woman \u2013 and her husband stands accused of murder.",
    "story": [
      "Seems that there is always a lot going on behind the walls of the White House where truth can often be stranger than fiction. But fiction can be pretty compelling, too. In the new novel \"The First Gentleman\" (to be published June 2 by Little, Brown & Co.), the commander in chief is a woman, and her husband is accused of murder. It's the third collaboration from best-selling author James Patterson and his co-writer, President Bill Clinton.",
      "Was there a scenario in the book that Patterson couldn't have written without Clinton's help? \"Oh, I couldn't have done any of it without him,\" Patterson said. \"I would have been lost. But the other thing, you know, look, I mean, he's the expert on the first gentleman. You know, he was almost a first gentleman!\"",
      "\"Yeah, I thought about it for years. And it's the only political job I ever wanted and I didn't get!\" Clinton smiled. \"'Cause I really thought Hillary should be president.\"",
      "Clinton would have been the very first first gentleman had his wife, Hillary, won the 2016 election. And he says back then he did a lot of thinking about what his role would be as a presidential spouse: \"How could I do this job in a way that I would be on-call to help if she needed me, but I wouldn't get in the way?\"",
      "\"That's the way I feel about this relationship: How can I help without getting in the way?\" Patterson said. \"I'm kind of the first gentleman of our [relationship]!\"",
      "\"If you believe that, I got some land in Arizona I want to show you!\" Clinton laughed.",
      "And sometimes, their made-up White House looks almost like real life. In the book, the president keeps working through an agonizing personal crisis. During his 1999 impeachment proceedings, President Clinton kept working, too, with some of the very people who were trying to kick him out of the White House. \"And they were amazed by it,\" he said. \"They'd come and do business with me, [and] as far as they knew, I couldn't remember what was going on. And we would try to hammer out deals.\" In the midst of impeachment? \"Because that's what I got hired to do,\" Clinton said. \"The American people don't pay you to have personal feelings. They pay you to deliver for them.\"",
      "Clinton and Patterson have been delivering since 2018, with their first book about a president gone missing, and in 2021 their second about the president's daughter getting kidnapped. Both were bestsellers. But for them, it's really not all about work.",
      "Asked how their relationship has evolved over their three books together, Clinton replied, \"We've played a lot more golf.\"",
      "Patterson said, \"He's been president more times, but I have more holes-in-one.\"",
      "\"Oh God. Well, I have one; he has nine,\" said Clinton. \"How many Americans have nine holes-in-one?\"",
      "\"I know. That's sick,\" Patterson said. \"Remember I'm a fiction writer.\"",
      "\"Makes the craziness stop for a little while\"",
      "I asked, \"There's so much political drama in the world today, real-life political drama. Do you think that there's an appetite for political thrillers, for fictional political thrillers?\"",
      "Patterson said, \"I think so, 100%. I mean, one of the nice things here is you escape, but you don't totally escape reality. It's like, 'Yeah, I love this. I can't put it down.' Or 'I keep reading,' or in some cases to me what's even better, which is you don't want it to end.",
      "\"I think it's useful, and 'cause so many people are wandering around, they go, 'Oh my God, oh my God, please make it stop'? This makes it stop for a little while, makes the craziness stop for a little while for people.\"",
      "Clinton said, \"One reason I hope there's an appetite is\u2026 I hope that people will still believe in our democratic system enough to stick with it and keep pushing to make it work.\"",
      "During the summer, Patterson lives at his home on the Hudson River; the president is about five miles away.",
      "Asked what they may have learned about each other during the writing process, Patterson offered, \"the notion \u2026 of not worrying about stuff that we can't do anything about. And if we can do something about it, try to do it.\"",
      "Their new book comes out tomorrow and they hope it's another bestseller. But if you spend any time at all with Patterson and Clinton, you get the sense that their partnership is about something money can't buy.",
      "I asked, \"Back when you wrote your first book together, The New York Times said that the two of you 'complete each other in the Jerry Maguire sense.'\"",
      "\"Well, we kinda do,\" Patterson said. \"This has been driving me for months now, which is: my time here is short. What can I do most beautifully? And in this case, doing another book with my friend is a beautiful thing to do.\"",

      "Prologue",
      "President Wright AdministrationYear Three: September",
      "1Brentwood, New Hampshire",
      "Cole Wright is sitting in the rear seat of a black up-armored Chevy Suburban, one of three in a convoy speeding its way down Route 125 in the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire.",
      "Two dark green state police cruisers, lights flashing, are leading this no-frills motorcade, scaled down for the occasion. The presidential limousine \u2014 the Beast \u2014 is back at the airport, along with the Secret Service counterassault team, support personnel, news media vans, and a fully equipped ambulance.",
      "Three years after the election, Cole still gets pumped from seeing traffic part like magic, even though he's well aware that it's for the convenience and safety of the woman sitting beside him \u2014 his wife, Madeline Parson Wright, the president of the United States.",
      "He's just the First Gentleman.",
      "A light drizzle spatters against the bulletproof windows. The agent accelerates to seventy along the two-lane highway.",
      "\"Two minutes out,\" says Burton Pearce, the president's chief of staff. Pearce perches in a rear-facing jump seat across from the First Couple. He's pale and serious, wearing one of his many identical gray suits. \"The Gray Ghost,\" staffers call him. The president nods without looking up.",
      "Cole glances over to see the CONFIDENTIAL stamps on the pages Maddy is reading as the convoy hums along. He knows those pages represent the biggest political gamble of her administration \u2014 of any administration. She should be in the Oval Office working the phones and twisting arms, but instead she's here with him. A powerful personal show of support.",
      "Maddy puts her briefing packet aside. Cole takes her hand and squeezes it.",
      "She squeezes back. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"After all we've been through together, we can get through this too.\"",
      "The Suburban slows down to make a hard turn behind the police escort. Now the convoy is moving at just forty miles per hour. On both sides of the route, locals hold up crude hand-painted placards.",
      "WE BELIEVE IN YOU, COLE!",
      "STAY STRONG, COLE!",
      "KEEP MOVING, COLE!",
      "He looks out through the tinted side window. Almost game time. He can feel his muscles twitching, his focus narrowing, just like in his days as a tight end for New England \u2014 before the blown knee forced him out. He remembers how the tension in the Patriots locker room would build and build almost to the breaking point until the team ran out into the light, and when the cheers of the crowd washed over him, he'd think, Yeah, we're okay. We've got this.",
      "But today?",
      "Today he's not so sure.",
      "The redbrick facade of the Rockingham County courthouse comes into view. The road is lined with police barricades holding back hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of onlookers. Up here, some of the signs have a different tone.",
      "SCUM!",
      "MONSTER!",
      "JUSTICE FOR SUZANNE!",
      "\"Don't worry about these people,\" says Maddy. \"They don't know what they're talking about.\"",
      "\"I don't care about the people on the road,\" says Cole. \"I'm worried about the twelve people waiting for me inside.\"",
      "As the Suburban slows to a crawl, two women jump out in front and unspool a long banner.",
      "CONVICT COLE WRIGHT! SEND HIM STRAIGHT TO HELL!",
      "Thanks for the kind wishes, Cole thinks.",
      "2",
      "A thousand demonstrators, media people, and curious locals are crowded into the rain-slick parking lot. The convoy is passing through the tall evergreens flanking the pavement leading up to the courthouse when I realize I left my umbrella in my car. Too late.",
      "Rockingham County has never drawn security like this. Uniforms representing every law enforcement department in New Hampshire \u2014 from local cops to Fish and Game \u2014 are patrolling the courthouse steps. On the roof there's a detail of men and women in tactical gear and black baseball caps carrying sniper rifles. They're not even trying to hide. That's the job of their colleagues, posted in places nobody can see.",
      "I hear someone calling my name: \"Brea Cooke? That you?\"",
      "I look at the crowd. Mostly white. No surprise; the Granite State is around 89 percent Caucasian. It's a situation I got used to as a Black student at Dartmouth, about two hours north. Let's just say it's not unusual for me to stand out around here.",
      "I turn around. \"Ron Reynolds!\"",
      "Ron is a friendly face from the old days when he and my partner, Garrett Wilson, both reported for the Boston Globe. He's wearing his standard outfit \u2014 tan overcoat, khaki pants, and a tweed cap. His big press pass is dangling around his neck.",
      "I give him a quick hug. \"Guess we both forgot our umbrellas.\"",
      "A guy in a thick camo jacket jostles by us and flicks a finger at Ron's press pass. \"Fake news!\" the guy shouts. Ron ignores him.",
      "\"So why are you here?\" I ask. \"You could be in one of those gyms right now, dry and toasty. Probably getting a better view than this.\"",
      "\"I get paid to get wet,\" says Ron. \"Even if nothing happens.\"",
      "But something is happening. I've been waiting for this day a long time. I see flashing lights coming up the drive. Two state police cars and three big black SUVs.",
      "\"It's them!\"",
      "The lights are getting closer. I'm in the middle of the crowd, but suddenly I feel as alone as I've ever felt in my life.",
      "I close my eyes for a second. My mind whispers, Garrett.",
      "I blink hard. Not now! I need to focus. Capture this scene for my book. Our book. The one Garrett and I were working on together. Until he ...",
      "Ron points to the courthouse steps. \"See the podium and the camera stands up there?\"",
      "I nod. \"What about them?\"",
      "\"All for show. No way the Secret Service allows the president and First Gent to go through the front entrance.\"",
      "\"The crowd won't appreciate being tricked like that.\"",
      "\"You're right,\" says Ron. \"They came to witness history.\"",
      "So did I.",
      "The first time in history that a president's spouse is going on trial for murder.",
      "3",
      "The convoy crawls toward the entrance as cops push the crowds back. Inside the six-ton Suburban in the middle, Cole rubs his hands together nervously. Pearce leans forward in his jump seat and says, \"The county sheriffs, state troopers, and Secret Service have carved out a path so we can go around to the rear of the courthouse. By the time the crowd and the press catch on, we'll be inside and out of sight.\"",
      "Hidden away, Cole thinks. \"No,\" he says quietly. \"That's not going to happen.\"",
      "Pearce blinks. \"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"I said no. Going in through the rear of the courthouse signals that I'm guilty, that I have something to hide. Screw that. I'm going to run the ball straight through the line of scrimmage.\"",
      "The Suburban moves toward the driveway turnoff. Pearce is getting testy. \"Cole, plans have been in place for days. Best to arrive via the rear from both a safety and PR viewpoint.\"",
      "But Cole is firm. \"We go through the front door. That's final.\"",
      "He turns to his wife. \"Maddy, will you say a few words on the courthouse steps?\"",
      "It's a big ask. Maddy doesn't need to tell him the source of the tension in her eyes. The conflict between being his loving partner while serving as POTUS, leader of the free world, is etched on her face.",
      "Maddy looks at her chief of staff. \"Cole is right, Burton. We go through the front entrance, heads held high.\"",
      "\"But, ma'am, we're just about there. Arrangements have been made.\"",
      "Cole sees Maddy shift into commander-in-chief mode. Cool. Crisp. Decisive. \"You've got a phone,\" she says. \"Make new arrangements.\"",
      "4",
      "They're getting out!\" Ron grabs my sleeve.",
      "Sure enough, I hear the slamming of heavy car doors and see movement at the front of the courthouse steps. The Secret Service is scrambling to clear a path to the podium.",
      "\"That takes some brass ones!\" Ron calls to me above the rising noise.",
      "A ring of dark suits surrounds President Wright and her broad-shouldered husband.",
      "The president walks up the wide steps and pivots to the podium. The crowd surges forward. Cops push back. Secret Service agents watch the sea of faces. And hands. Especially the hands. Looking for weapons.",
      "President Wright squeezes her husband's arm just before she leans into the microphones. \"Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, I will make this short and to the point.\"",
      "I hear her voice echo across the parking lot. She pauses after each phrase to let the words sink in.",
      "\"I have full faith and confidence in my husband's innocence, and I trust that the good citizens of New Hampshire, who have stood by my side over the years, will also support my husband during this time of crisis.\"",
      "The president turns and kisses her husband's cheek, making sure the cameras have a good angle. Then, as if it's an after-thought, she steps up to the mics again and says, \"I believe in our legal system, and I'm confident justice will be done here.\"",
      "She takes her husband's hand. The Secret Service team surrounds them. As a unit, they walk up the steps to the courthouse doors.",
      "\"Quite a performance,\" says Reynolds.",
      "\"It was a performance all right. Pure theater. They're not a couple \u2014 they're a damn criminal enterprise.\"",
      "My outburst must surprise Ron. A second later, he heads off to gather quotes.",
      "Once again, I'm alone. I scan the masses. Almost every man, woman, and child is looking toward the courthouse, trying to get one last glimpse of the First Couple.",
      "On the far side of the parking lot, I spot the lone exceptions: a man and a woman, looking straight at me.",
      "I've seen these two before. My watchers.",
      "Damn. Not again.",
      "The crowd shifts, and they disappear.",
      "All around me, people are chattering and yelling, but their words are a blanket of white noise. Again my mind whispers, Garrett. I hold out my hand, half expecting to see him reaching for me.",
      "I fight back the tears as reality hits home.",
      "The love of my life, Garrett Wilson, is dead. And I believe the man inside that courthouse is responsible for his death.",
      "The First Gentleman.",
      "He might even have pulled the trigger.",

    "story": [
      "Even if you're not a regular \"Family Guy\" viewer, you've probably heard the show's iconic theme song. The song is largely the creation of Seth MacFarlane, whose love of animation may only be rivaled by his love for big, jazzy tunes. In fact, he's even got a semi-regular gig at the Vibrato Grill Jazz Club in Bel Air, Calif., singing songs from the Great American Songbook.",
      "But one thing he doesn't seem to love, considering he's lived his life in the public eye, is a certain kind of attention. He says sometimes getting in front of a crowd (or even our \"Sunday Morning\" cameras) doesn't quite come naturally.",
      "He is, he admits, an introvert. \"Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. I don't even wanna be here!\" he said.",
      "In fact, he says he sometimes has to resort to liquid courage. \"I think I had like four scotches before I walked out on stage at the Oscars,\" he said, referring to his hosting gig in 2013. \"I do get, yeah, I definitely get nervous.\"",
      "You might know MacFarlane as the voice of Peter, Brian Griffin and Stewie on the show \"Family Guy\" that he created more than two decades ago. In 1999, MacFarlane became the youngest showrunner in Hollywood history. And less than a decade later, with three network shows on the air, he became Hollywood's highest-paid writer-producer.",
      "But back in college, MacFarlane's first love was singing. \"My sister, at the time, was going to the Boston Conservatory of Music for musical theater,\" he said. \"She has a beautiful singing voice. And I had got it into my head that I was going to maybe go to grad school for musical theater as well. So, I applied and got in. And I was all set to go to their grad program. And I got this offer from Hanna-Barbera to come do an animated short for a series that they were developing. And so, I just had to take it, moved out to California. But there was an instant there where I could have kind of diverged into a completely different career and never, you know, never even thought about something called 'Family Guy.'\"",
      "MacFarlane loved film scores as a college student and to this day he uses a live orchestra to score his TV shows.\u00a0 \"It's the one part that I don't really understand, even to this day,\" he said. \"There's still something mysterious about how a composer sits down to write, and then a couple weeks later walks in front of an orchestra, plops down these charts, and they all play it. And you hear this insane, magical sound. That still eludes me.\"",
      "Frank Sinatra Jr, and Stewie and Brian (Seth MacFarlane), perform \"At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant (Jr.)\" from \"Family Guy\":",
      "For his latest album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\" (out this week), MacFarlane and Joel McNeely, his composer and arranger for \"Family Guy,\" combed through the Sinatra Family archives for songs that had been arranged for Sinatra but never fully recorded. For McNeely, the process was almost like speaking to the ghosts of the greatest arrangers in popular music, the men who helped make Sinatra's voice shine.",
      "McNeely showed an arrangement by Nelson Riddle: \"This was the first one we read when we had a sight-reading session at Fox. We got an orchestra together just to see what was there, you know, because there was nothing to reference. But all this time later, these little black pencil dots on paper, there's his voice brought back to life. I mean, it was chilling.\"",
      "So, what exactly does an arranger do? \"Frank Sinatra, there's a recording of him saying that the arrangers could be in a sense a recording secretary, taking the vision of the artist and interpreting it into this,\" McNeely said.",
      "MacFarlane said, \"You take a song like 'Fly Me to the Moon,' for example, which I think was originally a ballad. [Here], it's the same song, but it's a completely different animal.\"",
      "McNeely says MacFarlane is preserving the essential legacy of the American Songbook through his recordings and the music of the TV show \"Family Guy.\" But what about the legacy of \"Family Guy\"? MacFarlane has some thoughts: \"When I started the show \u2013 this is the conversation that, like, tortures me at night! \u2013 when I started the show, my attitude was, it doesn't matter, none of it matters. It's like, It's funny? Let's do it.",
      "\"And the older I've gotten, I look back at shows that we've done, and I'm like, Gosh, I guess it's a little more complicated than that, isn't it? Comedy and jokes do have an impact. I have to figure out a way to maintain what the show is, and maintain the thing that people love. But at the same time, recognize that, like, all right, I am analyzing it now in a different way than I did when I was younger.\"",
      "If it's true that you're nobody 'till somebody loves you, then thanks to \"Family Guy\"'s legion of fans, Seth MacFarlane, it turns out, is a very big somebody indeed.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Emmy Award-winning actress Loretta Swit (Nov. 4, 1937-May 30, 2025) was best known for bringing Maj. Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan to full life on the long-running TV series \"M*A*S*H.\" The head nurse of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War, Houlihan brought her by-the-book attitude for Army rules against the anti-authoritarian streak of Alan Alda's \"Hawkeye\" Pierce. The series was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, and while toned down for television, the CBS series, produced by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, aimed to maintain the movie's anti-establishment ethos during the turmoil of the Vietnam War.",
      "After small roles on \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Mannix\" and \"Hawaii Five-O,\" Swit was called in to meet the producers of \"M*A*S*H.\" Then her agent informed her that she'd received an offer to appear in a movie with Olivia de Havilland, which conflicted with shooting the pilot. But \"M*A*S*H\" producer Gene Reynold told the agent, \"Nope, don't give her away. She's ours,\" Swit recalled in a 2020 Edge Magazine interview.",
      "As the show progressed, Swit expanded her character beyond being the target of the doctors' pranks, and fought against her character being tied down by her affair with Maj. Frank Burns (played by Larry Linville). She suggested that Hot Lips break up with Frank, meet a dashing man in Tokyo, and get engaged, married \u2013 and divorced. \"We really worked together like a well-oiled machine \u2013 everybody on this show worked together with the writers,\" she told Edge. \"You had these creative people, throwing ideas back and forth in positive, wonderful, rich ways. It was a very exciting time to be around, to be an actor in that situation. You could not help but get better and grow and learn.\"",
      "She won two Emmys for playing Houlihan, and received eight more nominations. She was also nominated for four Golden Globes. Although some actors came and went, Swit lasted throughout the show's 11-season run, which concluded in 1983.",
      "A native of Passaic, N.J., Swit had to overcome her mother's aversion to her becoming an actress. She recalled to the Toronto Star in 2010 her mom's reaction after attending a play in a Greenwich Village theater, \"walking in as though it were the doorway to Hades. After the show, I came out and my mother said to my father, 'If you don't stop her now, she may wind up doing this for the rest of her life.' That was it. That gave me the courage I needed to keep at it until I succeeded.\"",
      "On stage she starred in \"Same Time, Next Year,\" \"Shirley Valentine,\" and \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\" Other screen appearances include \"Freebie and the Bean,\" \"S.O.B.,\" and \"Murder She Wrote.\" She also founded a charity, the SwitHeart Animal Alliance.",
      "Houlihan would inspire countless women to become nurses, in part because the show was closer to reality that other medical shows. \"Up until 'M*A*S*H,' the doctors on television didn't lose patients; they always pulled them through,\" she said. \"That's nice, but it's not honest. We used to say that 'M*A*S*H' is not a John Wayne movie about war. In our series, people died, patients died, people got wounded and hurt. And we never stop talking about the ugliness of it. The humor came out of our own madness and craziness to have to be there to do that. The only way to survive was by being crazy and funny and drunk. I think 'M*A*S*H' took on cult status because we told everybody the truth.\""

    "story": [
      "Patti LuPone\u00a0has issued an apology after hundreds of Broadway performers spoke out against the three-time Tony Awards winner over what they say is a pattern of \"inappropriate and unacceptable public comments,\" specifically against Broadway star Kecia Lewis, in an open letter.",
      "\"For as long as I have worked in the theatre, I have spoken my mind and never apologized. That is changing today.\" LuPone said in her apology posted Saturday on social media.",
      "Lupone issued the apology in response to a\u00a0letter, dated May 30\u00a0 and addressed to the American Theatre Wing, the national trade association for the Broadway theatre industry, calling on decision makers to \"hold people accountable for violent, disrespectful, or harmful behavior.\" More than 500 Broadway performers \u2014 including\u00a0James Monroe Iglehart, Kalen Allen and\u00a0Tatianna C\u00f3rdoba \u2014 signed the open letter, which was first published in\u00a0Playbill.",
      "It comes after the New Yorker published an interview last week with 76-year-old LuPone, a White performer, in which she said of Lewis, who is a Black actress said: \"Don't call yourself a vet, bitch,\" apparently referring to Lewis' November 2024 video\u00a0posted to her Instagram\u00a0in which she spoke about LuPone's behavior.",
      "\"This language is not only degrading and misogynistic-it is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment. It is emblematic of the microaggressions and abuse that people in this industry have endured for far too long, too often without consequence,\" said the open letter.",
      "LuPone's issue with Lewis appeared to have began last fall when she starred in\u00a0\"The Roommate,\" a two-woman show with Mia Farrow\u00a0that was next door to\u00a0\"Hell's Kitchen,\"\u00a0a musical inspired by Alicia Key's life and music in which Lewis performed and won Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.",
      "According to Lewis' video, LuPone had made complaints about the noise from the musical, which led to changes to the sound design that \"negatively impacted\" the show and its performers. Lewis also brought up a video of LuPone refusing to sign a fan's \"Hell's Kitchen\" playbill because the musical is \"too loud.\"",
      "\"I wanted to address this because, Ms. LuPone, these actions, in my opinion, are bullying,\" Lewis said in the video. \"They're offensive, they are racially microaggressive, they're rude, they're rooted in privilege. And these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself, who has been in the business as long as you have.\"",
      "Lewis then asked LuPone, from one Broadway veteran to another, to apologize.",
      "When asked, LuPone addressed the situation in the New Yorker article, saying, \"This is not unusual on Broadway. This happens all the time when walls are shared.\"",
      "\"She calls herself a veteran? Let's find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn't know what the f--- she's talking about,\" LuPone told the New Yorker.",
      "CBS News has reached out to LuPone and Lewis for comment.",
      "When the New Yorker asked about Audra McDonald, who appeared to support Lewis' video, LuPone said: \"That's typical of Audra. She's not a friend.\" She added that the two had issues in the past, but didn't go into details.",
      "In her apology on Saturday, LuPone said she regrets her \"flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate, and I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in this community.\"",
      "\"I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies,\" LuPone added. \"I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter shared yesterday. From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theatre has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don't belong anywhere else. I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theatre community deserves better.\"",
      "McDonald, the most nominated and awarded performer in Tony Award history, told CBS News' Gayle King in an interview set to air Tuesday on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings\" that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years.",
      "\"If there's a rift between us, I don't know what it is. That's something you'd have to ask Patti about,\" McDonald said.",
      "Next week on June 8, the Tony Awards are set to broadcast on CBS and stream on Paramount+. McDonald could add snatch her seventh Tony win thanks to the revival of \"Gypsy.\"",

    "summary": "A Minnesota woman is advocating for patients with FTD, a certain type of dementia that impacts impulse control and self-awareness.",
    "story": [
      "In the United States, one in three people face memory loss or dementia.",
      "In life, you never know what cards you'll be dealt. Linde Jacobs lost her mother in 2022, which makes being a mother to two young daughters tough.",
      "She's struggled with how to properly grieve and cope. She's struggling with making sure her daughters see strength and resilience.",
      "There's also the fear. Unlike most people, Jacobs knows what cards are in her own future.",
      "\"I was speechless in that appointment,\" Jacobs recalled. \"I had never been delivered news like that before. It was something so shocking that I really didn't know how to grasp it and internalize it.\"",
      "Aside from years of love, Jacobs' mother had also given her a cruel gene that causes a condition nearly impossible to diagnose.",
      "\"She was boundary-less\"",
      "Alison Lee was a proud mother of three girls, a successful physical therapist and a doting grandmother. But when she turned 50, life turned upside down.",
      "\"Some of her impulses would be to touch people in public, so if she saw someone, she would go pull some guy's pants up because she said, 'I can see your underwear.' She was boundary-less, she didn't realize the social norms we place on what is appropriate,\" Jacobs said.",
      "Jacobs, a nurse herself, pounded doctors for information. She was told it was depression but she knew there was more.",
      "Meanwhile Lee's bizarre behavior continued. She started shoplifting, and after dodging a traffic stop she ended up in jail.",
      "Jacobs' sister received a letter from a fellow inmate saying, \"your mom doesn't belong here, I think she has dementia.\"",
      "\"It was affirmation, first time we had somebody look into this from a third party perspective and say this is dementia,\" Jacobs said.",
      "It was a diagnosis no doctor had given. Lee hadn't lost her memory but she had lost the mind she once had, and something clicked with Jacobs.",
      "Turns out, that inmate known only as \"Angie\" was right. That was 2018, and Jacobs still marvels at the gesture.",
      "\"The incredible kindness of a stranger to know that not only did she recognize this, but she recognized my mom as being vulnerable and then kept her sane,\" Jacobs said.",
      "Jacobs now had a clear path thanks to a to a stranger she'd never be able to thank.",
      "But with the context of dementia, Jacobs was able to figure out a lot. She recalled that her grandmother had similar impulsive behaviors.",
      "It was genetic \u2014 it was the mapT mutation of frontal dementia known as FTD. It's a disease that hits at 50, and instead of losing memories, patients often lose impulse control and self-awareness.",
      "\"Honestly, I had a lot of guilt that I was so intolerant to those symptoms when my mom would display them,\" said Jacobs.",
      "Jacobs watched her mom progress; one day Lee fell and hit her head. Because of the FTD, her brain couldn't take the swelling and she died at 62, leaving devastation and frustration.",
      "\"I had that understanding level while she was alive, this is not her, she is not doing this to me, this is happening because this disease is causing this symptom,\" Jacobs said.",
      "But she says it was hard to separate her mom from those symptoms. Amidst the grief, she learned that she and her two sisters had the gene, too. Jacobs said immediately, her mind went to her little girls.",
      "\"Truly, that I passed it on to my daughters,\" she said.",
      "Jacobs realized that there was very little information about MapT. She could barely Google the condition that she was most certainly going to have.",
      "Then, she and her husband happened to see a documentary on gene editing.",
      "\"And so he just Google searched \"FTD, CRISPR,\" and then we came across a physician that's based out of San Francisco, Dr. Claire Clelland,\" said Jacobs.",
      "\"It's just a matter of time\"",
      "In a busy laboratory on the other side of the country, Clelland received an email.",
      "\"I get contacted from patients, particularly gene carriers from around the world, but I remember just replying that I would try to help in the best way that I could,\" she said.",
      "That was the start of a powerful friendship.",
      "Jacobs set out on an advocacy journey across the nation, speaking to the nation's top neurologists and making them better understand this tricky and brutal disease that effects 40,000 Americans, essentially putting FTD on the map.",
      "Clelland said Jacobs' personal touch has fueled the process.",
      "\"And if you look at new therapies that make it through the pipeline and actually get to patients, often, they have patient supporters and champions that don't give up even when the work gets really hard,\" Clelland said.",
      "And that hard work landed Jacobs on the front page of the New York Times. From her frustration, to her grief, to that inmate's letter, she laid out her story for the world to see, giving her even more opportunity for revelations like the one she had in February inside a University of Minnesota research lab.",
      "It's there she saw a mouse with the frontal temporal dementia mutation she has. That mouse is a symbol of hope. It's part of promising research at the University of Minnesota.",
      "\"Linde sent me an email, she's actually the first FTD patient I've ever met,\" said Dr. Michael Koob, who is leading a team of researchers.",
      "Koob and his students are getting promising results for a treatment for people who know they have the gene.",
      "\"So, so for her, it's just a matter of time. This is going to happen. You know, at this point, I'm fairly confident that there will be an intervention that is going to work,\" said Koob.",
      "From the mice to the microscopes, things are looking up.",
      "WCCO followed Jacobs and her pursuit for two months. During that time, she had another breakthrough. It came at a coffee shop in River Falls, Wisconsin.",
      "A reunion",
      "After years, Jacobs finally found the inmate who had sent her the initial letter about her mom. She messaged her on Facebook, and the two set up a time to meet.",
      "When Jacobs met Angela Olson, the tears welled.",
      "\"I have no idea what the Lord is doing. I think it's amazing that he brought our lives together. I never realized, even writing that letter, what it was doing, right? I just knew that your mom was a really great person and needed help,\" said Olson.",
      "As they marveled at the letter, they marveled at the moment.",
      "\"I think there's so many times in life that, like, people are brought into our lives, right, for a poor purpose, right, and a bigger purpose,\" said Jacobs.",
      "\"Yeah, she's actually the beginning of my journey with sobriety,\" said Olson.",
      "Olson knew the ropes when it came to jail; she was 20 years into her addiction.",
      "\"Never, all these years, my whole life, I never understood how to have, actually, emotions. It's like I was rejected in my life, betrayed by people, but yet understand how to have love or emotion, and just was so suppressed. And so then I ended up coming to Teen Challenge,\" Olson said.",
      "Now she's seven years sober and thriving as a manager at Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge Recovery program. She spends her days sharing her story.",
      "Olson recalled that Lee \"just kept repeating herself.\" As a nurse herself, she had some experience with dementia.",
      "She marveled at the New York Times article with her letter in it.",
      "\"Just reading how Linde said, you know, she was easily diagnosed by inmates before any doctor diagnosed this condition. And I was just, thank you, Lord,\" Olson said. \"Thank you that something that I did would help this woman.\"",
      "Now, Jacobs has another partner in her fight to honor her mother and protect her daughters. She recently was invited to a gala in New York, with Anna Wintour of Vogue helping to lead fundraising.",
      "They raised $1.9 million dollars for frontal temporal lobe dementia.",

    "summary": "The new COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna, mNexspike, is made in a way that allows for a lower dose.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. approved a new COVID-19 vaccine made by Moderna late Friday but with limits on who can use it \u2014 not a replacement for the company's existing shot, but a second option.",
      "The new vaccine, mNexspike, is a step toward next-generation coronavirus vaccines. It's made in a way that allows for a lower dose - a fifth of the dose of its current COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax - by refining its immune target.",
      "The approval \"adds an important new tool to help protect people at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19,\" Stephane Bancel, Moderna's CEO, said in a statement Saturday.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved the new vaccine for use in adults 65 and older and people age 12 to 64 who have at least one health condition that puts them at increased risk from the coronavirus.",
      "That's the same limit the FDA set in licensing another COVID-19 vaccine option from competitor Novavax.",
      "Those restrictions are a departure from how the U.S. has handled COVID-19 vaccines until now, reflecting skepticism about vaccines from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump officials.",
      "Moderna's existing vaccine doesn't face those limits and has long been used for anyone ages 6 months and older. The company said it expected to offer both options this fall.",
      "The FDA's approval was based on a study of 11,400 people age 12 and older that compared the new low-dose vaccine with Moderna's existing vaccine. It found the new vaccine was safe and was at least as effective - and more by some measures - than the original shot, the company said.",
      "The news came just days after the Trump administration canceled funding for Moderna to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic flu viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu, despite promising early study results.",
      "It also comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changes its recommendation to children for COVID-19 vaccine under Kennedy's directive.",
      "The agency on Thursday dropped its recommendation for all children to get vaccinated, but still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children, in addition to most adults for now.",
      "Kennedy's directive cited \"a review of the recommendations\" of the Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, saying that the risks of the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children \"do not outweigh the purported benefits of the vaccine.\" The directive also cited \"the lack of high-quality data demonstrating safety of the mRNA vaccines during pregnancy combined with the uncertainty of the benefits\" for pregnant moms and their baby.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 19:37:00 -0400",
    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",
      "\"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says that kids with no underlying health conditions \"may receive\" COVID-19 vaccines, dropping a broad recommendation for all children to get vaccinated against the virus.",
      "Updates to the CDC's childhood immunization schedule were published late Thursday, following an announcement earlier this week by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.",
      "\"Where the parent presents with a desire for their child to be vaccinated, children 6 months and older may receive COVID-19 vaccination, informed by the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances,\" the CDC says in its new guidance.",
      "Thursday's change to what the CDC calls \"shared clinical decision-making\" recommendations for children means that health insurance companies will continue to be required to broadly cover the shots for now in this age group.",
      "The agency still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children, in addition to most\u00a0adults\u00a0for now. COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy are now listed as \"No Guidance/Not Applicable,\" where they were previously recommended for all pregnant adults.",
      "While Kennedy said in his video announcement\u00a0that healthy pregnant women were also being removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule for COVID-19 vaccines, several pages of agency guidance saying that pregnant women are recommended to get vaccinated because of their higher risk of severe disease remain on the CDC's website as of Friday.",
      "\"Studies including hundreds of thousands of people around the world show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective, and beneficial to both the pregnant woman and the baby. The benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy,\" one CDC webpage still reads.",
      "Health authorities and experts closely watch changes to the CDC's recommendations, usually updated through open meetings of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, since they are tied to policies like liability protections and insurance coverage requirements.",
      "The CDC also deleted a statement previously on the childhood immunization schedule that the guidance had been recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC and backed by a number of outside medical groups.",
      "So far, the CDC's changes echo what the committee had already been considering voting on next month: narrowing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and younger ages with risk factors, but still allowing for permissive coverage of others getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has used \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance in the past to allow for federal requirements guaranteeing insurance coverage and access to some vaccines, while stopping short of full-throated recommendations for everyone eligible to get a shot.",
      "At its last meeting in April, the committee had not signaled that they were planning to lift the recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated.",
      "Instead, pregnancy was listed during the meeting as among the underlying conditions that might warrant a continued recommendation for vaccination.",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its warning about the risk of contracting measles while traveling, after the agency tallied dozens of cases so far this year in travelers who were infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S.",
      "\"Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,\" the agency now says, in an update published Wednesday.",
      "Since the beginning of the year, the CDC has received at least 62 reports of travelers who were contagious with the highly transmissible virus while flying into the U.S. or within the country, a spokesperson for the health agency told CBS News in a statement.",
      "After investigating 50 of those travelers, the CDC was able to determine that measles spread during air travel in at least one of those situations, the spokesperson said. That is usually based on connecting confirmed cases of measles among airline passengers sitting near each other.",
      "There have also been numerous public alerts in recent months about the possible risk of exposure in airports, after travelers were found to be contagious. \"Exposures at the airport itself are more difficult to track, and state, local, and territorial health departments lead these investigations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In its Wednesday update, the CDC dropped its list of countries now facing \"high incidence\" of measles. Instead, the agency now warns only that the virus is \"an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected.\"",
      "In addition to this year's record surge of the virus within the U.S., health authorities in neighboring Mexico and Canada have also reported large outbreaks of measles.",
      "The CDC also replaced a previous recommendation that Americans \"consider making alternative travel plans\" if they could not get vaccinated before departing, and now says travelers should \"consider postponing their trip.\"",
      "All travelers are recommended to be fully vaccinated for measles before going to any international destination. The CDC recently updated its guidance to doctors advising additional measles vaccines\u00a0for some domestic travelers as well.",
      "The changes come as the CDC's tally of measles cases has begun to show signs of accelerating again.",
      "At least 1,088 cases of measles have been reported so far this year, the CDC said Friday, with two more states \u2014 Iowa and Nebraska \u2014 now reporting their first confirmed cases. Around 90% of confirmed cases are linked to outbreaks within the U.S., not travel outside the country.",

      "\"This outbreak does appear to be leveling off, but the affected states remain hypervigilant, and that's because it's travel season,\" the CDC's Dr. Manisha Patel, chief medical officer of the agency's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told a webinar published by the American Medical Association on May 15.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As state officials anticipate Medicaid funding cuts that could strip resources for those with disabilities and chronic health conditions, an army of unpaid caregivers waits in the wings: children.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.",
      "\"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,\" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. \"And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.\"",
      "In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.",
      "But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're \"actual people\" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.",
      "\"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,\" he said.",

      "Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said he's \"confident\" a U.S.-China trade dispute \"will be ironed out\" when Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a conversation. \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\"\u00a0Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

      "May 12 tariff pause",
      "The May 12 deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement.

Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",

    "summary": "As the trade standoff with China continues, President Trump announced the tariff on foreign steel will double from 25% to 50%.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday defended the Trump administration's escalating tariff policies, saying that while some companies have already announced price hikes, he thinks others will\u00a0 choose not to.",
      "\"Some are and some aren't,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" He pointed to companies like Home Depot and Amazon who have indicated they will not pass on tariff costs to consumers, whereas others, such as Walmart and Best Buy, have signaled potential price increases.",
      "President Trump on Friday announced that the tariff on foreign steel will double from 25% to 50%, effective June 4, and accused Beijing of violating a recent trade agreement by withholding critical exports like rare earth minerals.",
      "\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Friday morning on his Truth Social app.",
      "He added, \"The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement is the latest in the tariff standoff, coming nearly two months after Mr. Trump announced \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on the U.S.' trading partners, eventually hiking the levy on Chinese to 145%. China responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. In May, the U.S. eased the tariff on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China agreed then to reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "Bessent on Sunday emphasized the White House's intention is not to \"decouple\" from China but to \"de-risk,\"and defended the new trade stance as essential to national and economic security.",
      "\"What China is doing is holding back products essential for industrial supply chains in India and Europe,\" Bessent said. \"That is not what a reliable partner does.\"",
      "Retailers, however, have sounded the alarm about the ripple effects of the ongoing U.S.-China trade standoff. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target have warned that high tariffs on imports from Asia could drive up prices for American consumers.",
      "Bessent addressed such warnings as speculative, highlighting companies who have opted not to raise prices.",
      "\"I know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying,\" he said. \"They're not raising prices. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration has identified sectors where Americans will feel the impact most, Bessent pointed to easing food and energy prices, and insisted that overall inflation is falling. \"Egg prices have collapsed,\" he said, crediting the administration's economic council and trade policies. Although egg prices have come down from the highest levels earlier this year, the Consumer Price Index showed in May that egg prices are still 49% higher than they were in May 2024.",
      "Despite industry concerns, Bessent argued Sunday that companies often offer worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to shield themselves from legal risk.",
      "\"They have to give the worst case,\" he said. \"Because if they haven't, and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced that he would be doubling tariffs on steel to 50% as he visited a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh suburbs Friday, a week after teasing a \"planned partnership\" between the company and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel.",
      "\"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump later noted\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that the increase would also be applied to aluminum, and would take effect on June 4.",
      "The Nippon deal will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, according to Mr. Trump, who characterized the agreement last Sunday as \"an investment\" and \"partial ownership\" that will be \"controlled\" by the United States. The administration, however, has released few details about the deal.",
      "\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement last week was the latest twist in Nippon's yearslong effort to acquire U.S. Steel. Its nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden in January on national security grounds.",
      "Mr. Trump, who opposed the acquisition during the 2024 campaign, has since warmed to a deal between the steel producers, touting a $14 billion investment that the president said would \"create and save over 100,000 American jobs.\"",
      "\"You're going to be very happy,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"There's a lot of money coming your way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal includes \"vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.\" He added that U.S. Steel would also keep all of its blast furnace facilities at full capacity for at least the next decade and vowed that there would be \"no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.\" Every worker at U.S. Steel would soon be receiving a $5,000 bonus as well, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he approved a deal after the persistence of Nippon, whose offer kept getting \"better and better\" each time the company made another proposal.",
      "Later Friday night, after returning from his visit, Mr. Trump told reporters he has to approve the final deal with Nippon, and that \"we haven't seen that final deal yet.\"",
      "Sen. David McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, provided more details on the agreement in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., an arrangement that was also part of the deal rejected by Biden.",
      "McCormick did raise one potential difference in the latest iteration, stating that the U.S. would have a golden share.",
      "\"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\" McCormick said. \"There'll be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.\"",
      "McCormick said Nippon will have \"certainly members of the board, and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.\"",
      "\"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market \u2014 this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,\" McCormick said of Nippon. \"They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.\"",
      "It is not yet clear whether the golden share provision involves any U.S. ownership of the merged companies.",
      "The United Steelworkers union has opposed a sale, arguing that the Japanese company is making \"flashy promises\" that put American jobs at risk.",
      "In a statement Friday, union president David McCall said the group was not included or consulted in the discussions \"so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the 'planned partnership' between USS and Nippon or the 'golden share' that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.\"",
      "\"There is a vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing, just as there is a vast difference between allowing shareholders and executives to cash-out and putting workers' interests first,\" he said. \"Any final deal that may emerge from discussions between the merger parties and the federal government must be viewed through that lens, and not the lens of wishful thinking that has been adopted by far too many politicians and others.\"",
      "But without an acquisition, U.S. Steel had warned last year that the company would \"largely pivot away\" from its blast furnace facilities, which would put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The company said the future of its headquarters in Pittsburgh was also uncertain without an agreement.",

    "story": [
      "Las Vegas \u2014 The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is usually the first stop for millions of tourists. But the line to snap a photo is noticeably shorter this spring as inflation, which has brought on higher prices for visitors, has hit \"Sin City\" hard.",
      "\"We were here last year, almost exactly the same time,\" John Fischer, who is visiting from the United Kingdom, told CBS News. \"And it was probably 20% more [expensive] this year.\"",
      "U.K. tourist Stuart Woodfall said he was surprised to pay $9 for a coffee.",
      "\"In the U.K., we pay 4 pounds, 5 pounds for a coffee? So yeah, crazy,\" Woodfall said.",
      "Those higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic, but casual trips are down. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said 3.39 million people visited in March, down 7.8% from the same time last year. April saw a 5.1% drop in visitors from April 2024.",
      "Hotel occupancy also slipped, as the average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip reached $203 in April, the LVCVA said, up from $194 at the same time last year. The hotel occupancy rate rate in April was 84.5%, down slightly from 85.5% in April of 2024.",
      "\"I think what's driving that largely now is just a drop in consumer confidence,\" Steve Hill, CEO and president of the LVCVA, told CBS News.",
      "Hill says big resorts can absorb a few empty rooms if the price is right.",
      "\"The philosophy in Las Vegas prior to the pandemic was, at any cost, fill a room,\" Hill said. \"Now, that has moderated somewhat. And so there is a balance point that they have found that is actually a little bit below the occupancy that we saw at a peak, which was about 88% in 2019. They're comfortable in that 85% range at a little higher price.\"",
      "Another sore spot is that Las Vegas is seeing fewer international visitors, Hill explains. They are the ones who generally tend to stay longer and spend more.",
      "\"It's an investment in a trip, and we're typically a bucket list,\" Hill said. \"They want to come here, spend more days, really enjoy the experiences that are here. And so when we lose them, we're losing a very valuable customer.\"",
      "Tourists who do roll the dice in Vegas are currently dealing with heavy vehicle traffic. Months of construction and road closures for special events can turn a 10-minute ride into a crawl on the Strip.",
      "\"We've had so many customers say, 'We're never coming back to this city, you can't get anywhere,'\" said Will Tryon, co-owner of Adventure Photo Tours, which he operates with his wife Donna Tryon. Their company does tours in the surrounding region, including the Grand Canyon, Area 51, Zion National Park and Death Valley.",
      "The couple said higher fuel and insurance costs leave little room to cut prices. Some tours priced at $75 before the COVID-19 pandemic are now $109.",
      "\"The economy, the money, they don't have the money to spend,\" Donna told CBS News. \"And the fact is that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation.\"",
      "Even so, plenty of visitors are still shelling out for hot tickets like Dead & Company's residency at the Sphere this spring, and Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter Tour, which is coming to Allegiant Stadium in July.",
      "\"It's like, you can go for the fancy experience, but then you can find a place that's a pretty good price,\" said Marc Kutzin, who is visiting from New York.",
      "The summer calendar is full of concerts, festivals and sporting events, and Hill believes the city will be resilient.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 18:14:51 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has a number of options at his disposal to implement tariffs, but none are as broad and aggressive as IEEPA.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply county-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",
      "These tariffs differ from Section 301 levies in that the tariff rate is capped at 50%. Additionally, no formal investigation is required. The authority has never been used, according to experts.",

      "The investigation into the bitcoin torture case in New York City has revealed gruesome details about the alleged kidnapping and beating of an Italian man for his fortune in the cryptocurrency.",
      "What we know about the bitcoin torture case",
      "The unidentified 28-year-old man managed to escape from his alleged captors on May 23 in the affluent SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan, according to the New York Police Department. Bloodied and not wearing shoes, the man then found an NYPD traffic agent, who alerted police, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office.",
      "Two cryptocurrency investors, 37-year-old John Woeltz and 33-year-old William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment in the case. They're being held without bail. Attorneys for the suspects have declined to comment on the case.",
      "When investigators went through the SoHo town house where the man said he was held, they found a saw, crack cocaine, chicken wire, body armor, night-vision goggles, pictures of the man with a gun pointed to his head and ammunition, according to prosecutors.",
      "Woeltz, who is originally from Kentucky, was arrested when police went to the town house. Prosecutors said the large house has eight bedrooms and that Woeltz had the means to flee the jurisdiction if granted bail, with access to a private jet and a helicopter.",
      "Duplessie turned himself in to police on May 27, the NYPD said. His attorney said in court that Duplessie's involvement in the case is hotly disputed and he decided to turn himself in when he found out about Woeltz's arrest, CBS News New York reported.",
      "The Italian man arrived at the town house on May 6, according to prosecutors. The suspects are accused of previously threatening to have the man's family killed unless he paid them in bitcoin, and the suspects allegedly lured him to New York with an offer to return the bitcoin to him in person, prosecutors said.",
      "The suspects then allegedly held the man captive for over two weeks as they tried to get him to give up the password for his bitcoin wallet.",
      "During that time, the suspects are accused of shocking the man with electric wires, hitting him on the head with a gun and pointing a gun at his head several times, prosecutors said. An AirTag tracking device was tied around the man's neck, and the suspects allegedly told him they would find him if he left the house.",
      "Prosecutors also said the suspects allegedly hanged the man over the ledge of the building and threatened to kill him if he didn't give up his password. The suspects also allegedly threatened to have the man's family killed if he didn't give them what they wanted, prosecutors said.",
      "The man told authorities the suspects cut his leg with a saw, forced him to smoke crack cocaine and urinated on him during his captivity, according to prosecutors.",
      "\"To be tortured for 17 days in terms of a chain saw cutting your leg, in terms of putting your feet in water and electrocuting him, in terms of making the person ingest narcotics, horrible crime,\" NYPD Chief of Department John Chell, the police department's highest-ranking uniformed member, told CBS News New York.",
      "The man escaped after telling Woeltz he would give him the password, but it was on his laptop, prosecutors said. When Woeltz went to get the laptop, the man went downstairs and bolted from the house.",
      "Police sources told CBS News New York that two NYPD detectives did private security work for the suspects, but there isn't any indication that the detectives knew about the alleged kidnapping. One of the detectives picked up the Italian man at an airport and brought him to the SoHo town house, two sources told CBS News New York.",
      "The detectives were placed on desk duty May 28 and had their guns and badges taken from them pending an internal affairs investigation into the off-duty work, which the NYPD said wasn't authorized.",
      "One of the detectives was assigned to the security detail for New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\"Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty,\" Kayla Mamelak Altus, Adams' press secretary, said in a statement. \"We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.\"",

    "summary": "Consumer spending slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
    "story": [
      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump's tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.",
      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

    "story": [
      "Mondelez International, the company behind Oreo, Wheat Thins and other name-brand products, says Aldi is copying its packaging in an effort to dupe customers into buying the supermarket chain's products.",
      "In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Illinois, the snack company alleges that Aldi \"blatantly copies\" the distinctive packaging of its brands in order to mislead customers into thinking they are buying a Mondelez product when they are actually purchasing a store-brand version. The company is seeking monetary damages and a court order that would prevent Aldi from selling products Mondelez says infringe on its trademarks.",
      "Neither Aldi nor Mondelez immediately responded to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Mondelez names a number of Aldi products in its lawsuit that it alleges are look-alikes of its own popular snacks such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins, Nilla Wafers cookies and Nabisco Premium Saltine Crackers. The company claims the Aldi store-brand items have different names but bear similar packaging design elements \u2014 including font, colors, image placement and product names \u2014 to Mondelez products.",
      "Aldi's Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies, for example, come in a red box, similar to that of Mondelez's Nutter Butter cookies. The white script font and cookie image on the packaging also mimic the Nutter Butter packaging, the snack company claims.",
      "Aldi also sells a product called Thin Wheat, which in addition to the nearly synonymous name to Nabisco's Wheat Thins, has a similar design to the Mondelez product, including a yellow background, the word \"original\" and crackers pictured on the bottom half of the box, the lawsuit says.",
      "The trademark lawsuit is not the first for Aldi, which been called out numerous times over its products' packaging. Earlier this year, a U.K. appeals court ruled in favor of Thatchers, a cider company, which sued Aldi over design similarities in the packaging of its lemon cider.",

    "summary": "A rash of attacks on cryptocurrency owners is combining cybercrime with old-fashioned thuggery, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The recent case of an Italian tourist who was kidnapped in New York City and tortured by people allegedly after his cryptocurrency is drawing attention to a rash of crimes dubbed \"wrench attacks,\" which combine cybertheft with old-fashioned thuggery.",
      "The term stems from an XKCD comic that depicts a \"crypto nerd's imagination\" of the tech know-how that would be required to break into their digital wallet. In reality, the comic notes, all it would take is a heavy $5 wrench to threaten the crypto owner until they revealed their account password.",
      "Such attacks have picked up in recent months, partly because stealing a digital wallet can be easier than stealing money from a traditional bank account, said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, a crypto tracing firm. On top of that, the value of bitcoin has surged in recent months, making people with crypto holdings potentially lucrative targets for criminals.",
      "\"Criminals go to where the money is, and we're seeing a huge rise in the price of bitcoin,\" Redbord said. \"Before, you needed sophisticated cyber capabilities to hack someone, but now you can be a violent criminal who can beat [the password] out of someone.\"",
      "He added, \"I don't think I've ever been as taken aback by this type of illicit activity in crypto.\"",
      "The crypto world also has a culture of flaunting wealth via social media posts or appearances at crypto conference, which allows criminals to easily identify potential targets.",
      "Bitcoin traded Friday at nearly $105,000 per token, according to CoinDesk \u2014 about 53% higher than a year ago. The digital currency has soared partly as people seek alternatives to put their money than traditional investments like stocks and bonds, and as the Trump administration takes steps to promote the use of cryptocurrencies, including establishing a \"strategic crypto reserve.\"",
      "How to crack a wallet",
      "Cryptocurrency thefts aren't new, but they've typically involved hacking, such as a massive 2022 hack at crypto exchange Binance\u00a0in which thieves initially stole $570 million, as well as multiple hacks by entities the United Nations found were linked to North Korea.",
      "In response to such threats, crypto owners often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \"cold wallets.\" When used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But criminals have realized they don't need any technical skills to steal crypto assets, Redbord said. All it takes is gaining access to a person's crypto account password, because there's no third-party financial institution standing in the way of accessing funds held in a digital wallet, he explained.",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don't need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "NYC crypto kidnapping",
      "The case in New York City is somewhat unusual because it involves crypto investors allegedly trying to steal the assets of another investor, Redbord said.",
      "In that case, investors John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, face\u00a0charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment of the Italian tourist in an effort to steal his digital wallet containing bitcoin worth millions of dollars. Court papers allege that the pair held the unidentified 28-year-old victim for weeks in an apartment in New York City's fashionable Soho neighborhood.",
      "After the victim was abducted, he was shocked with electric wires, his leg was cut with a saw and he was forced to smoke crack cocaine, prosecutors allege. Items including a photo of a gun held to the Italian tourist's head were found in the apartment by investigators.",
      "Two New York City police detectives had been working security for the accused kidnappers, CBS News New York has reported. The detective have been placed on desk duty as police investigate.",
      "Such incidents have also occurred with increasing frequency in Europe and Asia. Several cases in France have mirrored the New York City attack, with French police arresting 20 people following several alleged kidnapping plots involving crypto investors and their families, the BBC reported earlier this week.",
      "In one case, a gang allegedly tried to kidnap the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency company executive in Paris, while earlier this month the father of a crypto millionaire was rescued by police in Paris after he was kidnapped and held for ransom.",
      "Aside from keeping a lower profile, crypto investors can take other steps to make it tougher for criminals, Redbord said. One option is to require permissions from several people to access a wallet, for instance.",
      "In the meantime, criminals are taking note and may be pursuing similar crimes, he added. \"They are seeing successes and trying to replicate these successes,\" Redbord said.",

    "story": [
      "Counselors who work with foreign students eager to attend college in the U.S. are advising them to purge their social media accounts of posts that could attract the attention of U.S. State Department officials.",
      "\"Any new student who comes on board \u2014 especially an international student who doesn't have a U.S. passport \u2014 we would be going through their social media with them and talk to them about what they are saying on Snapchat, in group chats,\" said Kat Cohen, founder and CEO of IvyWise, an educational consultancy firm for college admissions. \"Because, if the information comes off as being radical or anti-American in some way, it is not going to help them.\"",
      "The focus on international students' online profiles follows a new push by the Trump administration to scrutinize social media accounts as part of the evaluation process for student visa applications. In a cable dated May 27 and obtained by CBS News, the State Department said it was preparing to expand social media screening and vetting. The agency did not specify exactly what type of content it would be looking for.",
      "\"President Trump will always put the safety of Americans first, and it is a privilege, not a right, to study in the United States,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \"Enhanced social media vetting is a commonsense measure that will help ensure that guests in our country are not planning to harm Americans, which is a national security priority.\"",
      "The new vetting measures build upon an April\u00a0statement\u00a0from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announcing that the agency will be taking into account \"antisemitic activity on social media\" as \"grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.\"",
      "No politics",
      "Advisers who cater to international students applying to U.S. schools told CBS Moneywatch they are reluctant to advise them to delete their social media accounts outright. But they are urging students to eliminate political-themed posts, especially if they relate to controversial topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. IvyWise also discourages foreign students from reposting any information they haven't verified themselves, given that it might be inaccurate.",
      "\"We don't think students should delete their social media accounts completely,\" Cohen said. \"But we do need to make sure we go through their social media accounts with them to make sure that they are presenting themselves in the best possible light.\"",
      "Mandee Heller Adler, founder of International College Counselors, also recommends that students weed out potentially controversial posts, including any opinions or content related to politics.",
      "\"I'm not saying that they have to get rid of the whole thing altogether, but certainly delete any political posts,\" Adler told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is kind of an easy way for kids to protect themselves.\"",
      "Sasha Chada, who has led Texas-based college admissions counseling group Ivy Scholars for over a decade, said that asking students to delete their social media would be a \"tall order\" given how deeply ingrained the platforms are in their lives. People aged 18 to 24, for example, make up the largest share of Instagram users worldwide, at 32%, according to Sprout Social, a social media management platform.",
      "Chilling effect?",

      "A recent\u00a0study from SmartAsset ranks the best cities for first-time buyers \u2014 providing a cheat sheet of sorts for those on the hunt for a new home.

Other locales house hunters may want to keep an eye on include Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Davenport, Iowa; Muncie, Indiana; Springfield, Illinois; and St. Joseph, Missouri, which are among the least expensive metro areas, according to the study.",
      "While Midwestern cities ranked higher in affordability than others, only Lawton, Oklahoma, where homes have a median sale price of $150,007, made it into SmartAsset's top 10 cities for first-time homebuyers overall.",
      "Best place for expanded inventory",
      "One of biggest issues plaguing the housing market is the limited supply of homes for sale While studies show\u00a0that the inventory of available properties is rising in many markets, some metro areas are still suffering from\u00a0shortages, which increases competition and prices for homebuyers.",
      "If you're looking for more robust inventory, you may want to consider heading south. Cape Coral, Florida, offers the greatest number of homes for sale per capita, according to SmartAsset, followed by Port St. Lucie, Florida.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted a federal trade court's decision blocking most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, for now reinstating the levies imposed by the president under an emergency powers law.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief order that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now.",
      "A three-judge panel on the trade court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect.",
      "\"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the Federal Circuit to review the trade court's decision and also requested it halt that ruling while it considers the appeal.

      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" Desai said. \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 100,000 kitchen faucets have been recalled because they could lead to dangerous levels of lead exposure according to three separate\u00a0notices posted Thursday by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "Three different faucets models, manufactured in China and sold under the brands Vfauosit, Kicimpro and Basdehen, were determined unsafe after tests revealed they contain lead that could leak into the water supply and cause harm to young infants and children. No injuries have been reported thus far.",
      "Lead ingestion can \"cause harmful neurological effects on infants and young children, including attention-related behavioral problems, decreased cognitive performance and lower IQ,\" the CPSC says in the recall notices.",
      "The recalled faucets were sold for roughly $40 on Amazon.com between January 2024 and May 2025 by vendors Whisper08, Kicimpro and Chenfeng Store. The recalls, issued on May 29, affect an estimated 103,000 products. Amazon and two of the vendors are contacting known customers who purchased the items directly to notify them of the recall.",
      "Consumers with the faucets are advised to stop using them immediately and to reach out to the vendor for a refund. Consumers will have to provide a photograph of disposal to get their money back, all three vendors state in their respective recall notices.",
      "\"Until these faucets can be replaced, consumers should only consume water from the faucets after running the water for 15 seconds,\" the CPSC advises.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/top-predictor-financial-well-being-2000-emergency-savings-vanguard/",
    "published": "Wed, 28 May 2025 10:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "It doesn't take $1 million to secure a sense of financial well-being, according to new research from Vanguard.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't take $1 million to achieve the top predictor of financial well-being, according to new research from investment firm Vanguard. Instead, it's something far more attainable: Socking away at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account.",
      "A survey of more than 12,000 Vanguard investors found that it's not assets or income that is most associated with a higher level of financial well-being, but rather $2,000 worth of emergency savings. Having that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while an income of $500,000 increased well-being by 12%, and assets of $1 million or more boosted well-being by 18%.",
      "A sense of financial well-being signifies that an adult can fully meet their financial obligations and are secure in their financial future, allowing them to make choices to enjoy their life, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The findings come as many Americans are feeling more financially stressed, with a separate study from Primerica finding that about half of middle-class households expect to be worse off financially in 2026, almost double the share in December, due to worries about the cost of living and the economy. Taking small steps to build an emergency savings account could prove to help alleviate financial anxiety, noted Paulo Costa, a behavioral economist and certified financial planner at Vanguard who co-authored the research.",
      "\"What's so powerful about this research is that it's not about gathering a lot of money to have that peace of mind,\" Costa told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That initial $2,000 makes a big difference.\"",
      "While it may seem that having $1 million in assets should boost financial well-being more than $2,000 in a savings account, the results show the importance of being prepared for an unplanned expense, Costa added. (To be sure, most people in the study had $2,000 in emergency savings \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 versus $1 million in assets, at about 3 in 10.)",
      "The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, which means having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, he said.",
      "\"When is $2,000 more than a million dollars? It's when it comes to emergency savings,\" Costa said. \"The point of emergency savings is to have that money readily available if you need it. A lot of people have money, for example, in retirement accounts that may have some requirements about when you can withdraw that money and may have some tax consequences and some penalties.\"",
      "Retirement assets are generally not readily available to cover unexpected expenses, with people younger than 59 1/2 incurring a 10% penalty for taking out money. But having $2,000 set aside in a bank account means that you've got the peace of mind that you'll be able to handle a surprise car repair or medical bill.",
      "And people with $2,000 in emergency savings typically spend about 2 hours less each week thinking about their finances versus those without any savings, the study found.",
      "How many people can handle emergency expenses?",
      "To be sure, obtaining $2,000 in savings could prove out of reach for many Americans, especially those who are low income, struggling with debt or who reside in an area with a high cost of living. Vanguard's survey includes only people who have investment accounts at the company, which signals they have access to 401(k)s and other types of investment accounts that many Americans lack.",
      "Almost 4 in 10 Americans say they don't have the cash on hand to pay for a $400 emergency expense, according to research from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Still, more Americans appear to be socking away money for a rainy day, with the Primerica study finding that 64% of those surveyed in March said they had an emergency fund of at least $1,000, up from 58% two years earlier.",
      "Even if saving $2,000 seems out of reach, you can start small by saving as little as $10 a week, Costa said. The best idea is to find a strategy that works for you, whether that's budgeting or automating savings by directing a certain amount into a dedicated account with each paycheck, he said.",
      "\"I love the idea of, 'out of sight, out of mind,' so when you get paid, you immediately send money to your savings account,\" he said. \"By saving $50 per week, you will build up to $2,000 in less than a year.\"",
      "He added, \"Saving something is better than saving nothing. So just getting started, that really makes a big difference.\"",

      "Miami \u2014 Two South Florida shark divers convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline several miles from shore have been pardoned by President Trump.",
      "Pardons for Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. were signed Wednesday. They had been convicted in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction.",
      "The two men avoided prison time but were ordered to pay $3,343.72 in restitution, and the felony convictions prevented them from voting in Florida, owning firearms and traveling freely outside the U.S.",
      "\"We never stopped fighting, and justice has finally prevailed,\" Moore's attorney, Marc Seitles, said in a statement. \"We are thrilled the White House considered our arguments and determined this was an unjust prosecution. We could not be happier for John and Tanner.\"",
      "Moore, who was captain of a shark-diving charter boat, and Mansell, a crew member, spotted the longline about 3 miles off the Jupiter Inlet in August 2020, according to court records. Believing it was an illegal fishing line, the men freed the sharks and grouper, reported it to state wildlife officials and brought the line back to shore.",
      "Federal prosecutors later charged the men with theft. Officials said the line actually belonged to a fisherman licensed by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration to catch sharks for research.",
      "Mansell and Moore were convicted by a jury, and their appeals were later denied. The full and unconditional pardons signed by Mr. Trump erase those convictions.",
      "\"This case never should have been filed,\" Mansell's attorney, Ian Goldstein, said in a statement. \"These gentlemen made an honest mistake and were trying to save sharks from what they believed to be an illegal longline fishing setup. I can't think of two individuals more deserving of a Presidential Pardon.\"",

      "\"People are not \u2014 well, we all are going to die, so for heaven's sakes,\" Ernst responded.",

      "The town hall comments drew criticism from some potential opponents of Ernst, who is up for reelection next year. Nathan Sage, who is running for the Democratic nomination for Senate, said Ernst is \"not even trying to hide her contempt for us.\" And Democratic state Rep.

    "summary": "Another judge has blocked the Trump administration from using the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling the government hasn't promised adequate due process.",
    "story": [
      "A judge in California on Monday blocked the Trump administration from using the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, ruling that the government hasn't promised adequate due process.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge John Holcomb \u2014 who was nominated by President Trump in 2019 \u2014 is the latest to limit the administration's controversial practice of rapidly deporting people accused of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua under the 1798 law, which allows removals during an \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion\" of the United States. Courts in three other states have also blocked Alien Enemies Act removals, though under different arguments.",
      "Holcomb's preliminary injunction applies to most migrants who are in custody in the Central District of California, which includes Los Angeles, Orange County and several bordering areas. The judge previously issued a temporary restraining order last month.",
      "The case reached Holcomb's desk after a Venezuelan man named Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan petitioned for his release last month. Arevalo says he applied for asylum but was arrested at a scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in and told he was detained in part due to his tattoos. The government told the court that he wasn't detained under the Alien Enemies Act, but Holcomb concluded that Arevalo still \"faces an imminent threat of removal\" under Mr. Trump's order invoking the law.",
      "Holcomb ruled that Arevalo is likely to succeed in showing the government hasn't provided adequate notice for him to challenge his deportation. The judge said that in a hearing the government \"refused to tell the Court how much notice it actually intends to provide.\"",
      "\"Arevalo seeks to avoid being deported as an alien enemy without being afforded the opportunity to challenge that designation\u2014not to avoid deportation altogether,\" Holcomb wrote.",
      "However, unlike some other federal judges, Holcomb said Arevalo was unlikely to show the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act illegally. He wrote that it's up to the president, not the court system, to decide whether an invasion or predatory incursion has occurred under the law.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Monday's ruling adds to a complicated legal landscape for the Alien Enemies Act since March, when Mr. Trump first invoked the law against people accused of belonging to Tren de Aragua.",
      "Critics say the government has used the law to remove people without adequate due process. Hundreds of Venezuelan deportees have been sent to a Salvadoran supermax prison under the law \u2014 some of whom have no known criminal record. The Trump administration maintains that the deportations are lawful and necessary to crack down on gang violence.",
      "Courts in at least five states have weighed in on the law, reaching different conclusions. Judges in New York, Colorado and Texas have suggested Mr. Trump is using the Alien Enemies Act improperly because Tren de Aragua's actions don't constitute a foreign invasion or incursion. But a judge in Pennsylvania found that the president is allowed to use the law for alleged gang members, though she said the government hasn't provided deportees with enough notice.",
      "Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has not ruled on whether the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act is legal, but it has said the government needs to give people\u00a0a chance to challenge their deportation under the law. Last month, the high court blocked Alien Enemies Act removals in part of Texas on the argument that a group of migrants weren't given enough notice, but the justices did not specify how much notice deportees are owed.",
      "Last month, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the Supreme Court will probably need to be the final word on the Alien Enemies Act \u2014 and argued the court should rule soon.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate this week is taking up the massive budget package containing President Trump's second-term agenda, a measure that squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. Its path through the Senate seems destined to be similarly narrow, with the package almost certain to be revised, since parts of it are opposed by a handful of GOP senators critical to its passage.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, recently ventured to the other side of the U.S. Capitol to remind Republican senators \"that we are one team\" and pleaded with them to keep the bill substantially intact.",
      "\"I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House,\" Johnson said in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, acknowledged that balance, but told reporters \"the Senate will have its imprint\" on the bill. He can afford three \"no\" votes from Republicans if all Democrats vote to block its passage in the Senate, and there are no absences.",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has already indicated he opposes the bill because it will \"explode the debt.\" Including interest, the House bill would increase the debt by $3.1 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Similar to the House, in the Senate, there are Republicans who think there's not enough cost cutting, while others argue some provisions are too draconian.",
      "These are the key sticking points as the legislation moves to the Senate:",
      "Medicaid changes",
      "Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Josh Hawley of Missouri are among the Republicans who have expressed concern about some of the changes to Medicaid, a government program that provides health care to low-income Americans as well as those with disabilities. And the trio of senators supported an amendment to the budget resolution earlier this year that would have removed the language instructing the committee overseeing Medicaid to make $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.",
      "The House-passed legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. It also requires states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and it would penalize states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. The bill also seeks to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes, among other changes.",
      "While these Senate Republicans have generally been supportive of the work requirements, some have warned that they will not support the bill if it includes any cuts to Medicaid benefits.",
      "In a New York Times opinion piece published earlier this month, Hawley called \"slashing health insurance for the working poor\" both \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\"",
      "A handful of senators have also warned of the impact of freezing provider taxes at current levels, since states use the taxes to help fund their share of Medicaid costs, although Murkowski has expressed support for this. Hawley said he's concerned about the impact on rural hospitals, while also voicing opposition to new copay requirements for beneficiaries.",
      "\"I'm concerned about the provider tax. That's not a direct benefit cut, but if it closes rural hospitals, then people can't get coverage,\" Hawley told reporters. \"And I'm concerned about the cost sharing, I guess we're calling it \u2014 the sick tax. That's kind of a tax on benefit. You can't get your benefit in terms of seeing the doctor until you pay money out of pocket.\"",
      "He added, \"If rural hospitals close, what's the difference between that and a benefit cut? That's pretty tough.\"",
      "Deeper spending cuts",
      "Meanwhile, a number of fiscal hawks have balked at the bill's spending cuts or even threatened to oppose the measure without securing deeper cuts, echoing the frustration expressed on the other side of the Capitol by members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus throughout negotiations on the package.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said the package's aim to cut $1.5 trillion \"isn't squat, quite honestly.\" And Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has also rebuffed the cuts, saying the amount is \"not going to do it.\"",
      "\"Their bill would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it,\" Scott told reporters earlier this month, adding that the upper chamber should go through every line in the budget to find savings.",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said \"the job of the Senate is to try to increase the cuts in spending,\" calling the House cuts a \"great start\" while urging the Senate to hit $2 trillion. And Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told the network that he believes \"the Senate is going to cut spending more than the House.\"",
      "\"We're going to see the Senate be more fiscally conservative,\" Cruz added.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, agreed that the Senate needs to consider steeper cuts.",
      "\"I've said repeatedly I'm for cutting until we run out of votes,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Rolling back IRA clean energy tax credits",
      "The House-passed bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, including an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. But the provisions could face opposition in the upper chamber.",
      "Last month, Murkowksi, along with GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, penned a letter to the Senate majority leader to \"emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.\"",
      "\"While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,\" the group wrote.",
      "Tillis told reporters after the House passed the bill that the Senate needs to \"look at the specifics\" of revising the clean energy tax credits, saying \"we've got to make sure the businesses who believe the government was setting this as a priority don't have a lot of stranded costs.\"",
      "At the same time, other Senate Republicans, like Johnson, have called for eliminating the clean energy tax credits, setting up a possible clash within the conference.",
      "State and local tax deduction",
      "Among the provisions that spurred extensive debate in the House was one allowing residents to deduct more in state and local taxes on their federal returns, known as SALT. Divisions over an increase to the SALT cap threatened to sink the package in the days leading up to its passage in the lower chamber as a handful of blue-state Republicans fought for a higher cap, ultimately settling for $40,000, an increase from $10,000.",
      "In the Senate, the deduction is not an issue, since none of the blue states have Republican senators. Accordingly, a number of Senate Republicans have indicated that they oppose its inclusion in the bill.",
      "\"Eliminate it,\" Johnson, the Wisconsin senator, told reporters of the SALT cap increase.",
      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told The Hill that the cap could potentially be cut in half once the Senate makes its changes.",
      "But the House speaker said he warned senators that changing the provision would not only risk getting it through the lower chamber again, but also the Republican majority.",
      "\"In the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents,\" the Louisiana Republican told \"Face the Nation.\" \"Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House, and so, this is political reality.\"",
      "Debt ceiling",
      "Fiscal hawks are also unhappy with the inclusion of a provision raising the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. The debate comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act.",
      "Paul has been the most vocal in opposing an increase to the debt limit. The Kentucky Republican has said \"there's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before.\" Paul said he could be convinced to support the package if the debt ceiling provision is removed and voted on separately.",
      "Instead, Paul has proposed a short-term increase of $500 billion, raising the debt ceiling for a matter of months, which he said would allow conservatives to verify that spending cuts have actually been implemented before approving a further hike.",
      "\"If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?\" Paul said\u00a0Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"",
      "Paul's Senate colleague, Johnson, also backs splitting the package into multiple parts, as well as a smaller, short-term extension.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The package also cuts billions in federal dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The change will require states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries. Currently, the program is fully funded by the federal government, although states take on some of the cost to administer it. Beginning in 2028, states will have to chip in for the program as well.",
      "\"That's something that I heard some members voice concern about,\" Sen. John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, said before Memorial Day. \"So, we'll need to address that.\"",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                                  Cristina  Corujo\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The federal prosecutor who helped lead the largest federal criminal case in American history has resigned his position in the Justice Department.",
      "Longtime Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Rosen, the chief of the Justice Department's Capitol Siege Section, has departed for a post with a private law firm.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Rosen said President Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol rioters continue to shock and alarm the federal investigators who handled the cases.",
      "\"The message that [the pardons] send is that political violence towards a political goal is acceptable in a modern democratic society,\" Rosen said. \"That, from my perspective, is anathema to a constitutional republic.\"",
      "Rosen helped oversee a team of Justice Department attorneys as the agency grappled with an historically large onslaught of criminal cases after the Capitol riot, which injured dozens of police officers and caused millions of dollars in damage to the Capitol complex.",
      "He said the president's decision to pardon all \u2014 not just some \u2014 of the Capitol riot defendants was a stunning decision that has caused damage.",
      "\"It sends a terrible message to the American people,\" Rosen said. \"Individuals who were duly \u2014 and appropriately \u2014 convicted of federal crimes ranging in culpability are immediately let loose without any supervision, without any remorse, without any rehabilitation to civil society.\"",
      "Rosen handled a range of criminal cases during his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office of the District of Columbia, one of the largest and most powerful of the federal prosecutors' offices in the nation. In addition to drug and gun crimes, Rosen took on responsibility for the section handling Jan. 6 cases. He was a lead prosecutor in the case of Leo Kelly, an Iowa man who was convicted at trial in May 2023.",
      "He took note of the Justice Department's remarkable success rate in Jan. 6 trials, securing partial or full convictions in 100% of jury trials. Rosen blasted criticism from Trump supporters who allege the juries were biased or the prosecutions were politicized.",
      "\"The reason those juries convicted \u2014 and the reason those judges convicted individuals \u2014 was not because of some bug in the due process,\" Rosen said. \"It was because the evidence was overwhelming. It was the most videotaped crime in American history.\"",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump's Inauguration-Day pardons of the Jan. 6 defendants, Justice Department officials demoted or fired some of the prosecutors who handled the Jan. 6 prosecutions and disbanded the Capitol Siege Section. Critics have accused the administration of seeking vengeance or revenge, targeting attorneys with solid track records.",
      "\"To see those talented prosecutors be marginalized or removed from office is an affront to the independence of the department,\" Rosen said.",
      "The Justice Department and the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Rosen will soon be starting his new job as attorney at the Rogers, Joseph O'Donnell law firm in Washington, D.C.\u00a0He told CBS News, \"I felt like it was time for a change \u2014 and a time to take what I've been doing and what I've learned over the course of 15 years in state and federal practice \u2014 and bring it to the private sector, where I can benefit clients who are being scrutinized by the government.\"",

      "The State Department has told U.S. embassies and consulates to expand vetting for all visa applicants who wish to come to Harvard University, including visitors as well as students, according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "In an internal email dated May 29 and sent by Secretary of State Marco Rubio's office to all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts, consular officers were told that this \"additional vetting\" applies to anyone wanting a visa to come to Harvard for \"any purpose.\" That includes current or prospective students, faculty, employees, contractors, guest speakers and even tourists, per the email.",
      "The email told consular officers to \"conduct a complete screening of the online presence of any nonimmigrant visa applicant seeking to travel to Harvard University for any purpose.\" Officers should also \"consider whether the lack of any online presence, or having social media accounts restricted to \"private\" or with limited visibility, may be reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant's credibility.\"",
      "The email said consular officers can also request applicants to set their social media accounts to \"public\" for vetting purposes.",
      "Notably, the email states that the new vetting procedure for Harvard will also serve as a \"pilot for expanded screening and vetting\" of visa applicants \"generally,\" including for student visas. The State Department \"may announce similar measures for other groups of visa applicants as appropriate, and in accordance with U.S. law\".",
      "A State Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News on Monday the Trump administration has ordered \"additional vetting of any visa applicant traveling to Harvard University,\" with a goal of identifying applicants \"with histories of anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\" The spokesperson added the measures \"may also be expanded to other groups of applicants, as appropriate.\"",
      "A source familiar with the email who was granted anonymity to speak freely told CBS news that it will likely be difficult to implement the vetting instructions uniformly across all US consular sections around the world, and for all universities assuming this pilot process gets expanded to foreign applicants for other U.S. colleges.",
      "Earlier this week, the State Department told embassies it was preparing for \"expanded social media vetting\" of student visa applicants, according to a cable obtained by CBS News. The department ordered a halt to new student visa appointments in the interim.",
      "\"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in response to the visa appointment freeze earlier this week.",
      "The stricter vetting procedure now targeting America's leading global university is the result of two executive orders signed by President Trump: One that directed more vetting for visas, and one calling for a crackdown on antisemitism, per the email. The State Department spokesperson said the school has \"failed to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism.\"",
      "The Trump administration has taken aim at Harvard in recent weeks, accusing it of failing to respond to what it views as rampant antisemitic activity on campus.",
      "Last week, the administration sought to take away Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students \u2014 a significant threat for a school where just over one in four students are international. The order was blocked by a judge following a lawsuit from Harvard. The Trump administration has also frozen federal funding to the Ivy League school.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration tried to revoke the student visa status of thousands of international students, many of whom appeared to draw the government's attention due to minor legal infractions. That policy was halted by a judge.",
      "Rubio said Wednesday the State Department will \"aggressively revoke\" visas for some Chinese international students, including those studying in \"critical fields\" and people with links to the Chinese Communist Party. China's embassy in the U.S. called the move \"politically motivated and discriminatory.\"",
      "And some international students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests have faced detention, under a law allowing the government to revoke visas for anyone deemed to pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "When asked by reporters Friday whether he supports international students studying in the U.S., Mr. Trump said he does: \"We want to have great students here, we just don't want students that are causing trouble.\"",
      "\"I don't think Harvard's been acting very nicely,\" Mr. Trump said, reiterating his call to redirect funds from Harvard to trade schools. \"Harvard's trying to be a big shot.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to move forward with its plans to lay off thousands of federal workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to move forward with its plans to lay off thousands of federal workers at nearly two dozen agencies while a legal battle over the president's plans to drastically cut the size of the government moves forward.",
      "The Justice Department's request for emergency relief is the second in which it has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the ongoing dispute over its efforts to execute reductions-in-force, or layoffs, across the executive branch. The administration initially asked the Supreme Court to halt a two-week temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, but withdrew its request after she granted longer relief last month.",
      "That preliminary injunction issued by Illston prevented the Trump administration from implementing planned reductions-in-force, placing employees on administrative leave and proceeding with job cuts that are already in motion.",
      "The Justice Department's latest request for the Supreme Court's intervention comes after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined last week to halt Illston's order, which would have allowed the administration to resume its efforts to sharply scale down the size of the federal workforce.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a filing that the district court's order is \"flawed\" and rests on an \"indefensible premise,\" namely that the president needs authorization from Congress to oversee personnel decisions within the executive branch.",
      "\"It interferes with the Executive Branch's internal operations and unquestioned legal authority to plan and carry out RIFs, and does so on a government-wide scale,\" he wrote. \"More concretely, the injunction has brought to a halt numerous in-progress RIFs at more than a dozen federal agencies, sowing confusion about what RIF-related steps agencies may take and compelling the government to retain \u2014 at taxpayer expense \u2014 thousands of employees whose continuance in federal service the agencies deem not to be in the government and public interest.\"",
      "Mr. Trump began taking steps to shrink the government shortly after he returned to the White House. The president created DOGE, a cost-cutting task force that was led by Elon Musk, and his administration began working to dismantle agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, though they have been met with court challenges.",
      "Musk's time working in the government ended last Friday, with his status as a special government employee limiting him to working 130 days in a 365-day period. But Mr. Trump said the billionaire is \"really not leaving, he's going to be back and forth.\"",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order directing agencies to make plans to initiate \"large-scale\" reductions-in-force. On the heels of the president's directive, the Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management of Budget issued a memo directing agencies to submit plans for two phases of job cuts.",
      "Several department heads began executing their workforce cuts earlier this year, with thousands of federal employees losing their jobs. Other federal entities are planning to make significant reductions in the coming weeks and months.",
      "The reductions-in-force are separate from the mass terminations of probationary workers, who generally were in their positions for one or two years. But those firings, which took place in February, have also been the focus of lawsuits.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's executive order, labor unions, nonprofit groups and local governments sued nearly every federal agency to block the layoffs, arguing that the executive order exceeded the president's authority and violated the separation of powers.",
      "A federal district judge in San Francisco agreed to issue a temporary restraining order, and she extended that relief with a preliminary injunction. Illston's order covers 21 federal agencies and DOGE, and prevents them proceeding with the sweeping reorganization of the federal government.",
      "The judge also barred agencies from implementing any orders by DOGE to cut programs or staff in connection with Mr. Trump's February executive order. She clarified that the injunction does not limit agencies from proposing their own reorganization plans to Congress or engaging in their own planning activities without the involvement of OMB, OPM or DOGE. The agencies affected include the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, as well as\u00a0AmeriCorps\u00a0and the Social Security Administration, among others.",
      "In a 51-page ruling, Illston wrote that presidents do have the authority to seek changes to federal agencies, and nine presidents have over the last century sought to reorganize the executive branch \u2014 but only after obtaining approval from Congress.",
      "\"Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,\" the judge said. \"But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that \u2014 by statute \u2014 they must carry out. Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the 9th Circuit to lift Illston's injunction, and in a divided 2-1 decision, it refused to do so.",
      "\"The Executive Order at issue here far exceeds the president's supervisory powers under the Constitution,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The president enjoys significant removal power with respect to the appointed officers of federal agencies.\"",

    "summary": "GOP Rep. Michael Bost and two Republican presidential electors challenged Illinois' decision to count mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether to revive a Republican congressman's challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day.",
      "The dispute involving GOP Rep. Michael Bost will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term, which begins in October, with a decision expected by the end of June 2026. The question in the case is a procedural one: Whether Bost and two Republican presidential electors have the legal right to challenge state regulations concerning the time, place and manner of federal elections.",
      "If the high court finds that the plaintiffs do have the legal standing to sue, their lawsuit could proceed.",
      "The case concerns an Illinois law that dictates when vote-by-mail ballots have to be postmarked and received in order for them to be counted. Changes in state law in 2005 effectively allow a mail-in ballot received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted as long as it is cast by mail on or before the day of the election. At least 17 states also allow ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted.",
      "Bost, who was first elected to Congress in 2014, and two Republican presidential electors sued Illinois election officials over the deadline for counting mail ballots in 2022. They argued in part that the receipt and counting of late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes, infringing on their rights under the First and 14th Amendments, and contended that the ballot-receipt deadline is preempted by two federal statutes that set a uniform day for federal elections.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the case in 2023, finding that Bost and the two electors failed to allege that they have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing. A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the district court's decision last year, agreeing that the plaintiffs did not allege standing to bring their lawsuit because they did not plausibly allege they had been injured by the law involving late-arriving mail ballots.",
      "Bost and the electors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that in recent years, the ability of candidates and parties to sue over state laws that affect their campaigns has been restricted by the federal courts.",
      "\"The court's guidance is needed to correct the unwarranted narrowing of candidates' ability to challenge electoral regulations,\" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court, adding that it is \"vitally important\" for the Supreme Court to clarify whether candidates can challenge state election laws in federal court.",
      "\"It is important that courts hear and resolve well-pleaded challenges by federal candidates to state time, place, and manner regulations affecting their elections,\" the Republicans wrote. \"Aside from the interests of the litigants, it is important that the public conclude that elections are run in an orderly, not arbitrary, fashion.\"",
      "But Illinois election officials urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal, arguing that the plaintiffs disagree with their decision to count mail-in ballots that are cast on or before Election Day, but arrive after.",
      "\"They do not claim that Illinois's ballot receipt deadline affected their likelihood of prevailing in any race in which they have ever competed or are likely to compete in the future,\" the state officials said in a filing with the high court. \"Rather, petitioners contend that they are entitled to challenge the deadline simply by virtue of their status as candidates, on the theory that a political candidate can always challenge a state's regulation of the time, place, and manner of conducting an election.\"",

    "summary": "China's allegations come after President Trump on Friday accused the Chinese of violating a May 12 trade pact.",
    "story": [
      "China on Monday said the Trump administration is undermining the temporary\u00a0May 12 trade agreement between the two nations by issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and by planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "The Trump administration's actions \"seriously undermine the existing consensus reached at the Geneva economic and trade talks, and seriously damage China's legitimate rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in the June 2 statement.",
      "China's claims come after President Trump on Friday said that Beijing is violating a trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after the two countries announced on May 12 a\u00a0temporary but significant easing\u00a0of tariffs imposed on each other's imports earlier in the year. The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",
      "He added, \"The overall objectives of the trade aggression, other than the display of raw power, are as muddled as ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said he's \"confident\" a U.S.-China trade dispute \"will be ironed out\" when Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a conversation. \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\"\u00a0Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Wall Street was lower on Monday amid renewed concerns of a brewing trade war between the nations. The S&P 500 slipped 10 points, or 0.2%, to 5,901, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shed 0.1%.",
      "May 12 tariff pause",
      "The May 12 deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause still leaves tariffs higher than before Mr. Trump\u00a0started ramping them up\u00a0last month. Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",
      "\"If the United States and China were to disengage completely in another blitz of escalating tariffs, it would be a really big deal for the global economy,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a client note. \"Demand for industrial commodities would plummet. Supply chains spanning multiple borders would shut down.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "In declining to take up the case, the Supreme Court leaves intact a lower court decision upholding Maryland's ban on certain semiautomatic rifles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge to Maryland's ban on so-called assault weapons, leaving intact a lower court ruling that upheld the law.",
      "In declining to review the decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, the high court skirts for now a fight over whether the Second Amendment allows states to regulate the rifles that have been used in a wave of mass shootings. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision to turn away the case.",
      "The Supreme Court had already turned away the legal battle over Maryland's law last year because a federal appeals court had yet to rule. But the 4th Circuit upheld the measure last August, finding that weapons like the AR-15 could be banned in part because they are outside the scope of the Second Amendment.",
      "But the question of whether AR-15s are protected by the Second Amendment is likely to be soon decided by the Supreme Court. In a separate statement, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the issue is currently being considered by other federal appeals courts, and rulings from them \"should assist this court's ultimate decisionmaking.\" He predicted appeals to the Supreme Court will be before the court \"shortly,\" and said the justices \"should and presumably will address the AR-15 issue soon, in the next term or two.\"",
      "In addition to rejecting the appeal of Maryland's prohibition, the Supreme Court declined to consider a challenge to Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines, keeping the law in place. The court's decision to turn away the appeal from four gun owners and a firearms dealer leaves intact a lower court ruling that declined to block enforcement of Rhode Island's ban and found the challengers failed to show they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.",
      "The two disputes are among several to land before the Supreme Court following its June 2022 ruling that expanded the right to bear arms and laid out a new framework for determining when restrictions on firearms adhere to the Constitution.",
      "Under its new standard, the government must show that a measure is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation and is therefore allowed under the Second Amendment. The high court provided some clarification about its so-called historical tradition test in its last term when it upheld a federal law that bars alleged domestic abusers from temporarily having firearms, but courts have still struggled to apply the framework, leading to conflicting decisions on the constitutionality of longstanding gun laws.",
      "Maryland's assault-weapons ban",
      "Maryland's prohibition on certain semiautomatic rifles was enacted in the wake of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Under the law, it is a crime to possess, sell, transfer or purchase an \"assault long gun\" or a \"copycat weapon,\" which encompasses 45 specific guns or their analogues. A variety of semiautomatic handguns and rifles are still allowed, according to the Maryland State Police.",
      "In addition to Maryland, eight other states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws restricting semiautomatic weapons.",
      "A group of Maryland residents who want to buy rifles covered by the ban, a licensed gun dealer in the state and several pro-Second Amendment groups challenged the law in 2020, arguing that they have a Second Amendment right to own common assault rifles.",
      "The federal district court and U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the law, likening the banned firearms to the M-16 rifle, which the Supreme Court has said is outside the scope of Second Amendment protection.",
      "The Maryland challengers asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court put consideration on hold while it decided another gun case involving concealed carry rules in New York. In that ruling issued in June 2022, the Supreme Court laid out the new framework under which gun laws must be consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "Following its decision in that landmark gun case, the Supreme Court sent the challenge to Maryland's assault weapons back to the appeals court to reconsider the case.",
      "After applying that new framework to Maryland's ban, the 4th Circuit concluded last year that the assault weapons ban is constitutional. Focusing on the AR-15 in particular, the appeals court found that it is most useful in military service and can be banned consistent with the Second Amendment.",
      "It also rejected the challengers' contention that because the guns covered by Maryland's ban are commonly used, they are protected by the Constitution. Instead, the 4th Circuit said adopting this argument would mean that any dangerous weapon \"could gain constitutional protection merely because it becomes popular before the government can sufficiently regulate it.\"",
      "The appeals court also said that the ban is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation, as it \"is one of many in a storied tradition of legislatures perceiving threats posed by excessively dangerous weapons and regulating commensurately.\"",
      "The challengers again sought the Supreme Court's review, arguing in a filing that the justices should \"ensure that the Second Amendment itself is not truncated into a limited right to own certain state-approved means of personal self-defense.\"",
      "They argued the AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the U.S. and said the 4th Circuit's ruling \"turns a firearm possessed for lawful purposes by millions of Americans into an item with not even presumptive constitutional protection.\"",
      "But Maryland officials urged the court to leave the 4th Circuit's ruling intact, in part because they said it's too soon for the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "In his statement, Kavanaugh called the appeals court's decision \"questionable.\"",
      "\"Given that millions of Americans own AR-15s and that a significant majority of the states allow possession of those rifles, petitioners have a strong argument that AR-15s are in 'common use' by law-abiding citizens and therefore are protected by the Second Amendment,\" he wrote. \"If so, then the Fourth Circuit would have erred by holding that Maryland's ban on AR\u201315s complies with the Second Amendment.\"",
      "Thomas, in a solo dissent, said the Supreme Court should not wait to decide the constitutionality of laws outlawing AR-15s and lamented that the justices have put off addressing it for a decade.",
      "\"[F]urther percolation is of little value when lower courts in the jurisdictions that ban AR-15s appear bent on distorting this court's Second Amendment precedents,\" he wrote. \"I doubt we would sit idly by if lower courts were to so subvert our precedents involving any other constitutional right. Until we are vigilant in enforcing it, the right to bear arms will remain 'a second-class right.'\"",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines was enacted by its General Assembly in June 2022 in response to mass shootings that have upended communities nationwide in recent years. The law prohibits possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.",
      "People who had these magazines had six months to either modify them to accept no more than 10 rounds, sell them to a firearms dealer, take them out of state or turn them into law enforcement. Possession of large-capacity magazines is now considered a felony.",
      "The group of gun owners challenged the state's ban shortly before it was set to take effect, arguing it violated the Second Amendment. A federal district court judge denied the challengers' request to block the law, finding that keeping large-capacity magazines isn't conduct that is protected by the Second Amendment.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit then upheld the district court's decision, finding that the ban \"imposes no meaningful burden on the ability of Rhode Island residents to defend themselves.\" The three-judge appeals court panel also said that semiautomatic weapons outfitted with large-capacity magazines \"much more closely resemble\" the M-16 rifle, which is banned for civilian use, than traditional handguns.",
      "\"The burden on self-defense imposed by [Rhode Island's law] is no greater than the burdens of longstanding, permissible arms regulations, and its justification compares favorably with the justification for prior bans on other arms found to pose growing threats to public safety,\" the court said. It added that, when applying the Supreme Court's framework, \"our analogical reasoning very likely places LCMs well within the realm of devices that have historically been prohibited once their danger became manifest.\"",
      "The gun owners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lower courts have \"rubber-stamped\" firearms restrictions even in the wake of the high court's more recent decisions.",
      "\"The same law-abiding citizens who were unconstitutionally deprived of their right to carry arms outside the home before Bruen continue to be deprived of their right to keep arms that are common in the rest of the country,\" they wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court, citing the court's Jun 2022 decision. \"The result is a nation that remains split, with the Second Amendment alive and well in (most of) the vast middle, but routinely disregarded near the coasts.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials urged the Supreme Court to reject the case, saying it is not worthy of the court's attention \"at this time.\" They noted in a filing that the case arrived at the high court while proceedings are still in preliminary stages.",

    "summary": "The House passed President Trump's \"one, big, beautiful bill,\" which includes continuing the 2017 tax cuts, but several GOP senators have voiced concerns.",
    "story": [
      "A leading GOP friendly group supporting President Trump's \"one, big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0 is readying a $4 million advertising buy aimed at helping steer the effort through the Senate after a number of Republicans voiced concerns about the legislation as it stands.",
      "The plans from Americans for Prosperity, first reported on by CBS News, come as the GOP-controlled Senate is expected to focus on the sprawling bill key to Mr. Trump's agenda after it narrowly passed the Republican led-House last month.",
      "The messaging from AFP includes \"video and digital ads that will air on cable, connected TV, and other digital platforms,\" according to the organization. Television advertisements from the group will initially air in North Carolina, Louisiana, Maine, Idaho and the District of Columbia but could expand further.",
      "\"The sooner the Senate advances the bill, the sooner Americans start seeing relief where they need it most,\" said Brent Gardner, the organization's chief government affairs officer in a statement. The statement also noted the group is well aware that as the process being used to fast track the bill progressed \"the hill to climb was only going to get steeper.\"",
      "Crucial to the GOP bill is its continuation of key parts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was a legislative trademark of Mr. Trump's first term in office. But the expansive bill that passed the House also includes Medicaid work requirements, a raise of the debt ceiling and a bevy of other major measures that could prove politically difficult to pass even with the relatively strong GOP majority in the Senate.",
      "\"Look, I want to vote for it. I'm for the tax cuts. I voted for the tax cuts before. I want the tax cuts to be permanent, but at the same time, I don't want to raise the debt ceiling $5 trillion,\" Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The new advertising move from AFP include testimonials that show not only the impact of the 2017 tax cuts but also what could happen if Congress does not act soon to extend those earlier changes along with \"ads encouraging fiscal hawks in the Senate to find spending offsets by further eliminating wasteful Biden-era spending programs,\" according to details set to be released by AFP.",
      "Democrats in Congress have so far strongly resisted the Trump agenda legislation. While most legislation in the Senate typically requires bipartisan support because of the chamber's filibuster threshold, Republican leaders are using a procedural route that would allow them to pass the bill on the strength of their partisan majority alone. Already a messaging standoff has emerged around the bill that could play a major role in the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"Senate Republicans are doing everything in their power to rip away health care and spike costs for hardworking families, all to give billionaires a massive tax handout,\" Maeve Coyle, a spokesperson for the Senate Democrats campaign arm said in a recent statement. \"Under the leadership of Senate Republicans, millions of people are at risk of losing their health insurance \u2013 and voters will hold them accountable for it at the ballot box in 2026.\"",
      "The Republican Party doesn't need every one of its Senators to vote for the bill in order for it to pass due to the party's successful 2024 election that saw the right take back the majority in the chamber and finish with a total of 53 seats. But losing the support of just four GOP senators could doom the push.",
      "\"The Senate will have their differences, but focusing on where Republicans are unified is what will drive this bill forward \u2013 permanent tax cuts, energy abundance, secure borders, and the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse,\" Gardner, with Americans for Prosperity, said in a statement.",

      "Buu Nygren, president of the Navajo Nation, paused at the edge with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Below them, tribal government buildings, homes, and juniper trees dotted the tan and deep-red landscape.",
      "Nygren said he wanted Kennedy to look at the capital for the nation of about 400,000 enrolled members. The tribal president pointed toward an antiquated health center that he hoped federal funding would help replace and described life for the thousands of locals without running water due to delayed government projects.",
      "Nygren said Kennedy had already done a lot, primarily saving the Indian Health Service from a round of staffing cuts rippling through the federal government.",
      "\"When we started hearing about the layoffs and the freezes, you were the first one to stand up for Indian Country,\" he told Kennedy, of his move to spare the federal agency charged with providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.",
      "But Nygren and other Navajo leaders said cuts to federal health programs outside the Indian Health Service are hurting Native Americans.",
      "\"You're disrupting real lives,\" Cherilyn Yazzie, a Navajo council delegate, told KFF Health News as she described recent changes.",
      "Kennedy has repeatedly promised to prioritize Native Americans' health care. But Native Americans and health officials across tribal nations say those overtures are overshadowed by the collateral harm from massive cuts to federal health programs.",
      "The sweeping reductions have resulted in cuts to funding directed toward or disproportionately relied on by Native Americans. Staffing cuts, tribal health leaders say, have led to missing data and poor communication.",
      "The Indian Health Service provides free health care at its hospitals and clinics to Native Americans, who, as a group, face higher rates of chronic diseases and die younger than other populations. Those inequities are attributable to centuries of systemic discrimination. But many tribal members don't live near an agency clinic or hospital. And those who do may face limited services, chronic underfunding, and staffing shortages. To work around those gaps, health organizations lean on other federally funded programs.",
      "\"There may be a misconception among some of the administration that Indian Country is only impacted by changes to the Indian Health Service,\" said Liz Malerba, a tribal policy expert and citizen of the Mohegan Tribe. \"That's simply not true.\"",
      "Tribes have lost more than $6 million in grants from other HHS agencies, the National Indian Health Board wrote in a May letter to Kennedy.",
      "Janet Alkire, chairperson of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the Dakotas, said at a May 14 Senate committee hearing that those grants paid for community health workers, vaccinations, data modernization, and other public health efforts.",
      "The government also canceled funding for programs it said violated President Trump's ban on \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" including one aimed at Native American youth interested in science and medicine and another that helps several tribes increase access to healthy food \u2014 something Kennedy has said he wants to prioritize.",
      "Tribal health officials say slashed federal staffing has made it harder to get technical support and money for federally funded health projects they run.",
      "The firings have cut or eliminated staff at programs related to preventing overdoses in tribal communities, using traditional food and medicine to fight chronic disease, and helping low-income people afford to heat and cool their homes through the Low Income Home Energy Program.",
      "The Oglala Sioux Tribe is in South Dakota, where Native Americans who struggle to heat their homes have died of hypothermia. Through mid-May the tribe hadn't been able to access its latest funding installment from the energy program, said John Long, the tribe's chief of staff.",
      "Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute at the Seattle Indian Health Board, said the government has sent her organization incomplete health data. That includes statistics about Native Americans at risk for suicide and substance use disorders, which the center uses to shape public health policy and programs.",
      "\"People are going to die because we don't have access to the data,\" Echo-Hawk said.",
      "Her organization is also having trouble administering a $2.2 million federal grant, she said, because the agency handling the money fired staffers she worked with. The grant pays for public health initiatives such as smoking cessation and vaccinations.",
      "\"It is very confusing to say chronic disease prevention is the No. 1 priority and then to eradicate the support needed to address chronic disease prevention in Indian Country,\" Echo-Hawk said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said Kennedy aims to combat chronic diseases and improve well-being among Native Americans \"through culturally relevant, community-driven solutions.\"",
      "Hilliard did not respond to questions about Kennedy's specific plans for Native American health or concerns about existing and proposed funding and staffing changes.",
      "As Kennedy hiked alongside Navajo Nation leaders, KFF Health News asked how he would improve and protect access to care for tribal communities amid rollbacks within his department.",
      "\"That's exactly what I'm doing,\" Kennedy responded. \"Making sure that all the cuts do not affect these communities.\"",
      "Kennedy has said his focus on Native American health stems from personal and family experience, something he repeated to Navajo leadership. As an attorney, he worked with tribes on environmental health lawsuits. He also served as an editor at ICT, a major Native American news outlet.",

      "Pamela Hemphill is one of the more than 1,500 people whom Mr. Trump pardoned earlier this year for their roles in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection. She has invoked help from her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon Mr. Trump issued her on Jan. 20, his\u00a0first day back in the White House.",
      "Though Hemphill was a defendant of the largest criminal prosecution in American history, she is seemingly standing alone now as the only Jan. 6 defendant to refuse the clemency Mr. Trump offered.",
      "Speaking with CBS News from her home in Idaho, Hemphill said, \"The pardons just contribute to their narrative, which is all lies, propaganda. We were guilty, period.\"",
      "\"We all know that they're gaslighting us. They are using January 6 to just continue Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized,\" she said. \"They were not. When the FBI came to my home, oh my God, they were very professional. They treated me very good.\"",
      "Hemphill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the crowd on Jan. 6, 2021.",

      "Hemphill also pleaded guilty in January 2022 to a count of unlawful parading and was sentenced later that year to a term that included three years of probation.",
      "Her case mirrors many other misdemeanor cases from the U.S. Capitol siege, in which members of the crowd were not accused of making physical contact with police or damaging any property \u2014 though prosecutors emphasized how each member of the mob contributed to the breakdown of police lines, the injuries and the damage to American democracy.",
      "Hemphill told CBS News the pardons for her and fellow members of the crowd were inappropriate and damaging Americans' views of the federal government.",
      "\"How could you sleep at night taking a pardon when you know you were guilty? You know that everybody there was guilty. I couldn't live with myself. I have to be right with me. And with God,\" Hemphill said.",
      "Former Pardon Attorney Liz Oyer, who was fired by the Trump administration in March after a disagreement over a case, told CBS News that Hemphill's protest is a sharp contrast from the conduct of other Capitol riot defendants who championed their own pardons.",
      "\"Some Jan. 6 defendants blew up our phones seeking a copy of their pardons. They wanted the copies quickly,\" Oyer said. \"They wanted it framed and signed.\"",
      "Court filings reviewed by CBS News show other Jan. 6 defendants have utilized their pardon certificates to make arguments in court about their cases, restitution payments or other legal matters.",
      "In contrast, senate records obtained by CBS News show Hemphill sought assistance from Sen. James Risch to secure a formal acknowledgement from the Department of Justice that she will not accept her pardon.",
      "In an April 2 correspondence from the Office of the Pardon Attorney to Sen. Risch, the pardon attorney's office wrote, \"Ms. Hemphill's non-acceptance is noted.\" The letter said the Justice Department would not issue Hemphill a formal certificate to chronicle her pardon.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Risch said, \"The Office of U.S. Senator Jim Risch regularly assists constituents with matters pertaining to federal agencies or programs. Due to privacy concerns, we cannot disclose details about individual cases.\"",
      "Hemphill has sparred on social media and in podcasts with other Jan. 6 defendants over her arguments about what she says is the whitewashing of the Capitol riot. In one segment on a podcast earlier this spring, Hemphill debated Enrique Tarrio, a former Proud Boys leader who was convicted at trial and received the longest prison sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Tarrio's sentence was commuted by Mr. Trump.",

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",

      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them.

      "It's an evocative idea that has long bedeviled scientists: a huge and mysterious planet is lurking in the darkness at the edge of our solar system, evading all our efforts to spot it. Some astronomers say the strange, clustered orbits of icy rocks beyond Neptune indicate that something big is out there, which they have dubbed \"Planet Nine.\"",
      "Now, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive world has instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. And the existence of the new kid on the block could challenge the Planet Nine theory, the researchers have calculated.",
      "Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed and was\u00a0published online last week. That makes it three times smaller than Pluto.",

      "\"Lucky\" discovery",
      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",

      "\"See almost to the edge of the universe\"",
      "The icy rocks discovered in the Kuiper belt tend to have a clustered orbit going in a particular direction.

      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",
      "\"Record temperatures immediately become the new normal,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.",

      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" taped shortly before Tuesday's launch, Musk told correspondent David Pogue, \"If we're lucky, we've probably got about a 50% chance of sending ... ships from Earth to Mars at the end of next year. So November, December next year, in about 18 months.\"",
      "Asked if that timeline was realistic, Musk replied, \"Well, I try to give the 50th percentile. ... So you should expect half the time I'm wrong.\" [See more of the exclusive interview with Musk on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Sunday, June 1.]",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

    "story": [
      "Officials in Boulder, Colorado, have released new information about the attack Sunday on a group of peaceful demonstrators who were marching to support Israeli hostages in Gaza. They now say 12 people were injured, up from eight reported earlier, when the suspect hurled Molotov cocktails at the crowd.",
      "The incident is being investigated as an act of terrorism, according to the FBI, which described it as targeted. The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was taken into custody at the scene. He is facing multiple felony charges as well as a federal hate crime charge.",
      "Soliman is being charged in state court with 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, eight \"with intent and deliberation\" and the other eight \"with extreme indifference,\" Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Monday. Officials said additional charges could be forthcoming. He's also being charged with two counts of use of an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.",
      "Here is what we know so far:",
      "What happened in Boulder?",
      "The attack occurred around 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, near the historic County Courthouse in the city's downtown. It was the site of a march held to advocate for the hostages who were taken from southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, and have yet to be released.",
      "Witnesses said the suspect had a \"makeshift flamethrower\" and yelled \"Free Palestine!\" as he threw Molotov cocktails at demonstrators, leaving multiple people with burns, according to the FBI. Those who suffered injuries had been standing outside the courthouse. In the aftermath, a burn scar was visible in front of the courthouse building.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack, calling it a \"heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.\"",
      "The suspect had another 16 unused Molotov cocktails \"within arms reach\" at the time of his arrest, investigators said during a news conference Monday afternoon.",
      "Soliman  had set out to kill all the marchers but seemed to have had second thoughts, authorities said. He didn't throw all 18 Molotov cocktails he was carrying \"because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before\" police said in an affidavit cited by The Associated Press.",
      "Authorities said he expressed no regrets about the attack.",
      "One marcher told CBS News Colorado\u00a0the suspect looked like a landscaper when they approached. But Lisa\u00a0Trunquist said she felt something odd as they arrived at the courthouse.",
      "\"The groundskeeper was here, and I didn't know why. Things were off,\" Trunquist said.",
      "He wasn't a groundskeeper.",
      "Then, after he tossed the devices, she and her fellow marchers worked as a team to try to put out the flames that were burning their fellow marchers, Trunquist recalled.",
      "The FBI's Colorado office said those who attended the march were participating in a scheduled, weekly event. Organized by the group Run for Their Lives, local branches hold community walks and runs in different cities within Colorado, around the country and internationally.",
      "\"We are a local chapter of the global initiative Run For Their Lives,\" reads the description of the Boulder chapter's Facebook page. \"We do an 18 minute weekly walk to show international solidarity with the hostages taken from Israel during the 10/7 massacre, and still being held in Gaza. We will walk until they are all released.\"",
      "Rachel Amaru, an organizer at Run for Their Lives in Boulder, called the attack \"blatantly antisemitic\" in comments to CBS News Colorado. It took place less than two weeks after two Israeli Embassy employees were killed in a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., which is also being investigated as a hate crime.",
      "Omer Shachar, a co-leader of Run for Their Lives Denver, told CBS News the group contacted Boulder police several times about security concerns around the event prior to Sunday. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.",
      "Who was injured in the Boulder attack?",
      "Police initially said the victims of the Boulder attack included four women and four men, whose ages range from 52 to 88. One of them was seriously injured, according to Boulder Police Chief Stephan Redfearn, who said the person had been hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "The 88-year-old is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder. Wilhelm described her as a \"very loving person.\"",
      "Another victim is a professor at the university, the rabbi said.",
      "Two of the injured were flown by helicopter to the burn unit at UCHealth, and four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, according to police and the hospitals. The injured patients who were taken to Boulder Community Health had either been discharged or transferred elsewhere later Sunday night, the hospital said, although it did not specify how many were discharged versus transferred.",
      "Officials said Monday that four more people came forward later with less severe injuries.",
      "Who is the Boulder attack suspect?",
      "The suspect was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday. He is facing multiple felony charges and a federal hate crimes charge.",
      "Witnesses heard Soliman yell \"Free Palestine\" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said it was \"clear this is a targeted act of violence.\" Two sources told CBS News that witnesses who spoke to investigators also alleged the suspect shouted \"End Zionist\" during the attack.",
      "The suspect told investigators he \"researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them,\" an affidavit filed by the Department of Justice reads.",
      "He also allegedly \"stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,\" and that he had been planning the attack for a year, the affidavit says.",
      "The suspect had tried to purchase a firearm but couldn't because he was not a U.S. citizen, so he resorted to Molotov cocktails instead, the acting U.S. attorney for Colorado, J. Bishop Grewell, said during a news conference Monday.",
      "Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS News Colorado. Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said he first arrived in the United States in August 2022, originally on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023. She said he filed for asylum a month after arriving in the U.S., in September 2022, but did not provide details about the outcome of that immigration case or whether it was resolved.",
      "Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder.",
      "He made his first court appearance on Monday and could be seen with a bandage over the right side of his face. He responded \"yes\" when asked whether he understood a judge's question on a protection order against him that keeps him from contacting the victims of his alleged crimes. His next court hearing is Thursday for an official filing of charges.",
      "After the attack on Sunday, authorities evacuated three blocks of Pearl Street for the rest of the day as they probed a vehicle of interest in the area, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. On Sunday night, the FBI said it was \"conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack\" in El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard have referred to the incident as a terrorist attack.",
      "\"The @ODNIgov's National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7,\" Gabbard wrote in a social media post.",
      "Soliman's former employer, an independently owned medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado, called Veros Health, told CBS News he had a valid work visa while employed there from May 2023 to August 2023.",
      "\"We can confirm that Mohamed Soliman worked with Veros from May 2023 to August 2023.

That amendment failed.",
      "The House-passed legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. It also requires states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and it would penalize states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. The bill also seeks to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes, among other changes.",
      "While these Senate Republicans have generally been supportive of the work requirements, some have warned that they will not support the bill if it includes any cuts to Medicaid benefits.",

      "A handful of senators have also warned of the impact of freezing provider taxes at current levels, since states use the taxes to help fund their share of Medicaid costs, although Murkowski has expressed support for this. Hawley said he's concerned about the impact on rural hospitals, while also voicing opposition to new copay requirements for beneficiaries.",
      "\"I'm concerned about the provider tax. That's not a direct benefit cut, but if it closes rural hospitals, then people can't get coverage,\" Hawley told reporters. \"And I'm concerned about the cost sharing, I guess we're calling it \u2014 the sick tax. That's kind of a tax on benefit. You can't get your benefit in terms of seeing the doctor until you pay money out of pocket.\"",
      "He added, \"If rural hospitals close, what's the difference between that and a benefit cut? That's pretty tough.\"",
      "Deeper spending cuts",
      "Meanwhile, a number of fiscal hawks have balked at the bill's spending cuts or even threatened to oppose the measure without securing deeper cuts, echoing the frustration expressed on the other side of the Capitol by members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus throughout negotiations on the package.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said the package's aim to cut $1.5 trillion \"isn't squat, quite honestly.\" And Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has also rebuffed the cuts, saying the amount is \"not going to do it.\"",
      "\"Their bill would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it,\" Scott told reporters earlier this month, adding that the upper chamber should go through every line in the budget to find savings.",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said \"the job of the Senate is to try to increase the cuts in spending,\" calling the House cuts a \"great start\" while urging the Senate to hit $2 trillion. And Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told the network that he believes \"the Senate is going to cut spending more than the House.\"",
      "\"We're going to see the Senate be more fiscally conservative,\" Cruz added.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, agreed that the Senate needs to consider steeper cuts.",
      "\"I've said repeatedly I'm for cutting until we run out of votes,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Rolling back IRA clean energy tax credits",
      "The House-passed bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, including an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. But the provisions could face opposition in the upper chamber.",
      "Last month, Murkowksi, along with GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, penned a letter to the Senate majority leader to \"emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.\"",
      "\"While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,\" the group wrote.",
      "Tillis told reporters after the House passed the bill that the Senate needs to \"look at the specifics\" of revising the clean energy tax credits, saying \"we've got to make sure the businesses who believe the government was setting this as a priority don't have a lot of stranded costs.\"",
      "At the same time, other Senate Republicans, like Johnson, have called for eliminating the clean energy tax credits, setting up a possible clash within the conference.",
      "State and local tax deduction",
      "Among the provisions that spurred extensive debate in the House was one allowing residents to deduct more in state and local taxes on their federal returns, known as SALT. Divisions over an increase to the SALT cap threatened to sink the package in the days leading up to its passage in the lower chamber as a handful of blue-state Republicans fought for a higher cap, ultimately settling for $40,000, an increase from $10,000.",
      "In the Senate, the deduction is not an issue, since none of the blue states have Republican senators. Accordingly, a number of Senate Republicans have indicated that they oppose its inclusion in the bill.",
      "\"Eliminate it,\" Johnson, the Wisconsin senator, told reporters of the SALT cap increase.",
      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told The Hill that the cap could potentially be cut in half once the Senate makes its changes.",
      "But the House speaker said he warned senators that changing the provision would not only risk getting it through the lower chamber again, but also the Republican majority.",
      "\"In the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents,\" the Louisiana Republican told \"Face the Nation.\" \"Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House, and so, this is political reality.\"",
      "Debt ceiling",
      "Fiscal hawks are also unhappy with the inclusion of a provision raising the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. The debate comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act.",
      "Paul has been the most vocal in opposing an increase to the debt limit. The Kentucky Republican has said \"there's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before.\" Paul said he could be convinced to support the package if the debt ceiling provision is removed and voted on separately.",
      "Instead, Paul has proposed a short-term increase of $500 billion, raising the debt ceiling for a matter of months, which he said would allow conservatives to verify that spending cuts have actually been implemented before approving a further hike.",
      "\"If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?\" Paul said\u00a0Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"",
      "Paul's Senate colleague, Johnson, also backs splitting the package into multiple parts, as well as a smaller, short-term extension.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The package also cuts billions in federal dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The change will require states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries. Currently, the program is fully funded by the federal government, although states take on some of the cost to administer it. Beginning in 2028, states will have to chip in for the program as well.",
      "\"That's something that I heard some members voice concern about,\" Sen. John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, said before Memorial Day. \"So, we'll need to address that.\"",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                                  Cristina  Corujo\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The federal prosecutor who helped lead the largest federal criminal case in American history has resigned his position in the Justice Department.",
      "Longtime Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Rosen, the chief of the Justice Department's Capitol Siege Section, has departed for a post with a private law firm.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Rosen said President Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol rioters continue to shock and alarm the federal investigators who handled the cases.",
      "\"The message that [the pardons] send is that political violence towards a political goal is acceptable in a modern democratic society,\" Rosen said. \"That, from my perspective, is anathema to a constitutional republic.\"",
      "Rosen helped oversee a team of Justice Department attorneys as the agency grappled with an historically large onslaught of criminal cases after the Capitol riot, which injured dozens of police officers and caused millions of dollars in damage to the Capitol complex.",
      "He said the president's decision to pardon all \u2014 not just some \u2014 of the Capitol riot defendants was a stunning decision that has caused damage.",
      "\"It sends a terrible message to the American people,\" Rosen said. \"Individuals who were duly \u2014 and appropriately \u2014 convicted of federal crimes ranging in culpability are immediately let loose without any supervision, without any remorse, without any rehabilitation to civil society.\"",
      "Rosen handled a range of criminal cases during his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office of the District of Columbia, one of the largest and most powerful of the federal prosecutors' offices in the nation. In addition to drug and gun crimes, Rosen took on responsibility for the section handling Jan. 6 cases. He was a lead prosecutor in the case of Leo Kelly, an Iowa man who was convicted at trial in May 2023.",
      "He took note of the Justice Department's remarkable success rate in Jan. 6 trials, securing partial or full convictions in 100% of jury trials. Rosen blasted criticism from Trump supporters who allege the juries were biased or the prosecutions were politicized.",
      "\"The reason those juries convicted \u2014 and the reason those judges convicted individuals \u2014 was not because of some bug in the due process,\" Rosen said. \"It was because the evidence was overwhelming. It was the most videotaped crime in American history.\"",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump's Inauguration-Day pardons of the Jan. 6 defendants, Justice Department officials demoted or fired some of the prosecutors who handled the Jan. 6 prosecutions and disbanded the Capitol Siege Section. Critics have accused the administration of seeking vengeance or revenge, targeting attorneys with solid track records.",
      "\"To see those talented prosecutors be marginalized or removed from office is an affront to the independence of the department,\" Rosen said.",
      "The Justice Department and the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Rosen will soon be starting his new job as attorney at the Rogers, Joseph O'Donnell law firm in Washington, D.C.\u00a0He told CBS News, \"I felt like it was time for a change \u2014 and a time to take what I've been doing and what I've learned over the course of 15 years in state and federal practice \u2014 and bring it to the private sector, where I can benefit clients who are being scrutinized by the government.\"",

      "In an internal email dated May 29 and sent by Secretary of State Marco Rubio's office to all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts, consular officers were told that this \"additional vetting\" applies to anyone wanting a visa to come to Harvard for \"any purpose.\" That includes current or prospective students, faculty, employees, contractors, guest speakers and even tourists, per the email.",
      "The email told consular officers to \"conduct a complete screening of the online presence of any nonimmigrant visa applicant seeking to travel to Harvard University for any purpose.\" Officers should also \"consider whether the lack of any online presence, or having social media accounts restricted to \"private\" or with limited visibility, may be reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant's credibility.\"",
      "The email said consular officers can also request applicants to set their social media accounts to \"public\" for vetting purposes.",

The State Department \"may announce similar measures for other groups of visa applicants as appropriate, and in accordance with U.S. law\".",
      "A State Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News on Monday the Trump administration has ordered \"additional vetting of any visa applicant traveling to Harvard University,\" with a goal of identifying applicants \"with histories of anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\" The spokesperson added the measures \"may also be expanded to other groups of applicants, as appropriate.\"",

      "The stricter vetting procedure now targeting America's leading global university is the result of two executive orders signed by President Trump: One that directed more vetting for visas, and one calling for a crackdown on antisemitism, per the email. The State Department spokesperson said the school has \"failed to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism.\"",
      "The Trump administration has taken aim at Harvard in recent weeks, accusing it of failing to respond to what it views as rampant antisemitic activity on campus.",

      "Witnesses said the suspect used a \"makeshift flamethrower\" and threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims, police and the FBI said. Boulder police initially said eight people were injured; they raised the total to 12 on Monday afternoon after officials said four more people with less serious injuries came forward.",
      "The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday evening. Soliman was allegedly heard yelling \"Free Palestine\" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said that it was \"clear this is a targeted act of violence\" and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism.",
      "Soliman has been charged with multiple felony counts, including attempted murder, and a federal hate crimes charge.",
      "Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, the Department of Homeland Security said. That original visa expired in February 2023, and he had applied for asylum. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs.",
      "The FBI said later Sunday night it was \"conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder\" in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located.",

      "The walk to remember the\u00a0Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza\u00a0was taking place in Boulder's downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also yelled \"End Zionist!\" during the attack.",
      "Among those injured were four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, police said. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be \"safe to say\" that person was in critical condition.",
      "Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a \"very loving person.\" Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.",
      "The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward.",
      "UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged.",
      "Following the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall.",
      "Omer Shachar, Run for Their Lives Denver co-leader, told CBS News the group reached out to Boulder police about security concerns surrounding the walk several times before Sunday's event. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.",

Our prayers are with the victims and our Jewish community across the world,\" she said.",
      "Bondi added, \"This vile anti-Semitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC,\" referring to the fatal shooting of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky outside the Capital Jewish Museum on May 21. \"We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.\"",

Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked \"simply because they were Jews\" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute \"the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law,\" according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a \"heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.\"",
      "\"As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,\" Polis said. \"Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Run for Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, \"This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release.\" The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video.",
      "Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they've been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages\u00a0each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday's walk.",
      "Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them.",
      "\"So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,\" said Victor.",
      "Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.",

I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today's violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.\"",

    "summary": "In 2023, the Supreme Court ruled against race-conscious college admissions. Now, data on the first class of students to enter since then gives a peek into what the future of college enrollment holds.",
    "story": [
      "The full impact of the Supreme Court's June 2023 ruling that colleges can't consider race in admissions may not be known for years. But a CBS News analysis of enrollment records shows the first class of freshmen since the high court's order is a little less diverse than the class before it.",
      "College admissions experts say there are signs campuses will trend toward less diversity at the same time some universities are facing intensifying pressure from the Trump administration to eliminate diversity programs and remove international students.",
      "CBS News gathered first-year enrollment data from 116 colleges and universities, 76 of which considered race in admissions before the Supreme Court ruling. The data showed the share of underrepresented minority students among those schools decreased by about 2 percentage points from fall 2023 to fall 2024.",
      "Underrepresented minority students include Hispanic, Black, Indigenous or Pacific Islander students. These are groups that have historically had disproportionately lower rates of college admissions.",
      "Among the 35 schools that did not previously consider race in admissions, the share of underrepresented minority students remained roughly the same, suggesting the ruling may have influenced diversity on campus.",
      "Five schools did not report whether or not they considered race in admissions.",
      "CBS News found the drop in diversity was even sharper at the most elite colleges and universities. At 17 schools that accept less than 10% of applicants, the share of minority students fell nearly 5 percentage points. This includes schools like Dartmouth, Princeton, Cornell, Brown and Tufts.",
      "Despite this, the most selective schools still had a slightly higher share of underrepresented minority students than other institutions we collected data from.",
      "While the one-year drop itself seems small, the fall 2024 semester was the first time the percentage of underrepresented minority students had decreased since at least 2015.",
      "Black students experienced perhaps the most significant one-year shift. At the 76 schools that previously considered race in admission but no longer do, the average share of Black students dropped from 6.4% in fall 2023 to 5.3% in fall 2024, the lowest level in the data collected since at least 2015.",
      "Early data \"sends up a warning flag\"",
      "Dominique Baker, an associate professor of education and public policy at the University of Delaware, said it's still too early to draw any concrete conclusions from this data.",
      "\"We like to look at trends over a longer period of time, because in any given year, we could see a blip that goes up, a blip that goes down,\" Baker said.",
      "But if the trend continues over four years \u2014 by the time these students are seniors \u2014 it could mean the campuses they attend will be significantly less diverse.",
      "For Baker, this \"sends up a warning flag.\"",
      "\"We're now starting to see ... early indicators that we might be seeing a negative trend developing in the share of students of color who are attending, particularly the underrepresented minority students that you all are talking about attending more selective institutions,\" she said.",
      "She pointed to research out of California, one of the nine states that had banned affirmative action prior to the Supreme Court ruling.",
      "A 2020 study found that enrollment among Black and Latino students at UCLA and UC Berkeley, the more selective campuses in the University of California system, fell by 40 percentage points after voters outlawed race conscious admissions (the state ban passed in 1996 and went into effect in 1998). It concluded that California's ban on affirmative action exacerbated socioeconomic inequities among Black and Brown students.",
      "Desmond Kuhn, an 18-year-old sociology and urban studies major at Columbia University who identifies as African American, said the Supreme Court ruling happened as he was starting to apply for college.",
      "\"It's very discouraging and also makes it harder to reach a lot of these, especially private elite universities, because a lot of generally Black and Hispanic communities don't have the same resources as, say, White and Asian communities,\" Kuhn said.",
      "He said he saw the difference in resources between his predominantly Black high school in the suburbs of Detroit and the predominantly White private boarding school where he retook his SAT.",
      "Columbia University published first-year enrollment numbers for fall 2024, but in a different format than the federal data collection, which we used in our analysis. In Columbia's reporting, the percentage of students who self-identified as Black or African American dropped from 20% for the class of 2027, to 12% for the class of 2028. (In this reporting method, students can identify with more than one race, whereas in the federal data, students could only pick one.)",
      "Columbia declined to provide CBS News data in the same format used for the analysis of other schools, so the university is not included in our overall findings.",
      "Other factors at play",
      "Across all schools, the share of students who did not report their race in enrollment records (and were classified as \"unknown\") grew significantly \u2014 the largest spike since at least 2015.",
      "While the data suggests the start of a downward trend in the share of underrepresented minority students at colleges and universities, the jump in the \"unknown\" category means the racial makeup of the class of 2028 could be different than what is being reported.",
      "If many of the students who did not report their race were White, then the share of White students would be higher than the reported data might suggest, lowering the share of underrepresented minority students. But if the students who did not report their race were Black or Hispanic, then the share of Black or Hispanic students may be higher than what is reported.",
      "\"That's part of the really, really big challenge of ... charting and thinking through who is currently enrolling at colleges and universities after the Supreme Court decision,\" Baker said.",
      "Tom Delahunt, the vice president for strategic recruitment and enrollment at Southwestern University in Texas, said the drop in underrepresented minority students could also be because of problems with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, that were at play while the future fall 2024 freshman class would have been making decisions about if and where to go to college.",
      "Typically, students can apply for the FAFSA on Oct. 1 each year. But in 2023, the form wasn't available until Dec. 30. As a result, schools couldn't offer financial aid on time because they did not have the FAFSA information, forcing students to wait for delayed offers.",
      "\"Delays, glitches, and other issues led to a 9% decline in submitted FAFSA applications among first-time applicants, and an overall decline of about 432,000 applications as of the end of August,\" said a report from the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Delahunt said that many of the students who had delayed FAFSAs would likely only make decisions about schools if their families had the money to go ahead without knowing how much they were going to have to pay. But many underrepresented minority students may come from poorer families that could not afford to guess how much college would cost.",
      "Impact of diversity on campus",
      "Experts said studies have found diversity of all kinds, not just racial diversity, is essential to students' education.",
      "\"These studies don't say that [only] students of color benefit from diverse learning environments. White students also benefit. Every student benefits from a diverse learning environment,\" Baker, from the University of Delaware, said.",
      "Jennifer Levine, a first-year student at Stanford University who is half Asian and half Jewish, agreed. She participates in a residential humanities program, where she lives with the same students she takes classes with, a group she described as predominantly White. The uniformity, she said, makes for \"a worse learning space.\"",
      "\"I think that all academic environments are made better with more opinions, more experiences, people who have different sets of knowledge,\" she told CBS News. \"For me as someone who's not Black reading Toni Morrison, I can't offer my perspective on that in the sense of race.\"",
      "Stanford's first-year class has roughly half as many Black students this year compared to last year. Austin Shaw, one of those Black freshmen, said he can see the difference. He lives in a dorm that is themed around the Black diaspora, so many Black students choose to live there.",
      "\"All of us are very tight because we're literally like half of the Black freshman population,\" he said of his dormmates. \"But when you go out into class, it's a completely different vibe.\"",
      "Shaw said that about half of the students in his high school in Los Angeles were Black. One of the reasons he chose Stanford over other California schools was that it had a higher proportion of Black students.",
      "\"You become an expert on the subject of being Black, or you feel like you have to represent, or you feel like you have to talk for your community,\" he said. \"When I was in high school, where half of the class would be Black, you wouldn't have that expectation.\"",
      "Other ways to ensure a diverse student body",
      "Delahunt, of Southwestern University, said this ruling, along with other restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, have made his job harder. He said his goal is to try to ensure that the student body reflects the community around it in Georgetown, Texas, just north of Austin.",
      "This is so \"when they leave ... they are ready for the next step of entering into society as a contributing member of society, that they understand how to work together. That we're going to have differences, and that's OK. How to work through those differences, how to work together to solve problems,\" Delahunt said.",
      "Now, without being able to see race and ethnicity on admissions forms, he must rely heavily on recruiting from high schools where he knows the population of the school is reflective of the mix of students he wants to come to Southwestern.",
      "\"Our job hasn't changed. Maybe the way we do it has to change a little bit. But our goals are the same,\" Delahunt said.",
      "Richard Kahlenberg, director of the American Identity Project at the Progressive Policy Institute, said that if schools were to consider socioeconomic status instead of race, they could still increase diversity on campus. Kahlenberg testified on behalf of Students for Fair Admissions in support of the ruling ending affirmative action.",
      "With data obtained through the legal process, he and an economist ran dozens of admissions simulations and found that considering socioeconomic status and ending preferential admissions for legacy students could increase diversity at Harvard and the University of North Carolina while maintaining academic caliber.",
      "\"If there were some universities that did not see declines in racial diversity, as we know there were some, then it's incumbent upon those institutions that saw larger drops to learn what happened,\" Kahlenberg said.",
      "He added that universities and colleges have argued that this method would be far more expensive, as it would increase the amount of financial aid the schools have to provide.",
      "\"It's not that race-neutral alternatives are ineffective, it's that they cost more money,\" he said.",
      "Some schools have increased socioeconomic diversity. UNC increased the number of students with federal Pell Grants to nearly a quarter of the class. Both Yale and Dartmouth's first-year classes had the highest-ever share of first-generation and low-income students, all while increasing their share of underrepresented minority students.",
      "All diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are at risk",
      "As universities adapt admissions processes to maintain diversity, they risk butting heads with an administration that is seeking to end all diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "The Department of Justice announced at the end of March that it is investigating four California universities to assess their compliance with the Supreme Court's ruling.",
      "University of California schools, which have not been allowed to use race as a factor in admissions directly since voters passed Proposition 209 in 1996, recently moved from using test scores and GPA for admissions to a \"comprehensive review\" process.",
      "That process looks \"at multiple factors beyond courses and grades to evaluate applicants' academic achievements in light of the opportunities available to them and the capacity each student demonstrates to contribute to the intellectual life of the campus,\" according to the University of California's admissions website.",
      "UC admissions for underrepresented minority students has increased since the initial drop following Prop 209, with the nine universities admitting the largest share of underrepresented minority students in its history in 2021. But the schools' student bodies are still less diverse than the California population or the cohort of high school graduates who meet UC admissions requirements.",
      "Underrepresented minorities make up about 32% of the UC fall 2024 freshman class. But they make up 46% of Californians and more than half of the state's high school graduates who meet the minimum academic requirements to get into UC schools.",
      "However schools choose to adapt, ignoring race in wholistic admissions entirely is unrealistic, said Levine, the mixed-race Stanford freshman.",
      "\"Parts of your identity can't be separated from your field of study, from your interests, from what you do,\" she said. \"My identity is tied to the kinds of things I'm interested in, what I wrote my essays about to get into college. Taking out my race from that is not going to take away the fact that that is part of who I am.\"",

      "The case concerns an Illinois law that dictates when vote-by-mail ballots have to be postmarked and received in order for them to be counted. Changes in state law in 2005 effectively allow a mail-in ballot received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted as long as it is cast by mail on or before the day of the election. At least 17 states also allow ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted.",
      "Bost, who was first elected to Congress in 2014, and two Republican presidential electors sued Illinois election officials over the deadline for counting mail ballots in 2022. They argued in part that the receipt and counting of late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes, infringing on their rights under the First and 14th Amendments, and contended that the ballot-receipt deadline is preempted by two federal statutes that set a uniform day for federal elections.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the case in 2023, finding that Bost and the two electors failed to allege that they have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing. A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the district court's decision last year, agreeing that the plaintiffs did not allege standing to bring their lawsuit because they did not plausibly allege they had been injured by the law involving late-arriving mail ballots.",
      "Bost and the electors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that in recent years, the ability of candidates and parties to sue over state laws that affect their campaigns has been restricted by the federal courts.",
      "\"The court's guidance is needed to correct the unwarranted narrowing of candidates' ability to challenge electoral regulations,\" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court, adding that it is \"vitally important\" for the Supreme Court to clarify whether candidates can challenge state election laws in federal court.",
      "\"It is important that courts hear and resolve well-pleaded challenges by federal candidates to state time, place, and manner regulations affecting their elections,\" the Republicans wrote. \"Aside from the interests of the litigants, it is important that the public conclude that elections are run in an orderly, not arbitrary, fashion.\"",
      "But Illinois election officials urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal, arguing that the plaintiffs disagree with their decision to count mail-in ballots that are cast on or before Election Day, but arrive after.",
      "\"They do not claim that Illinois's ballot receipt deadline affected their likelihood of prevailing in any race in which they have ever competed or are likely to compete in the future,\" the state officials said in a filing with the high court. \"Rather, petitioners contend that they are entitled to challenge the deadline simply by virtue of their status as candidates, on the theory that a political candidate can always challenge a state's regulation of the time, place, and manner of conducting an election.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-maryland-assault-weapon-ban/",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "In declining to take up the case, the Supreme Court leaves intact a lower court decision upholding Maryland's ban on certain semiautomatic rifles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge to Maryland's ban on so-called assault weapons, leaving intact a lower court ruling that upheld the law.",
      "In declining to review the decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, the high court skirts for now a fight over whether the Second Amendment allows states to regulate the rifles that have been used in a wave of mass shootings. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision to turn away the case.",
      "The Supreme Court had already turned away the legal battle over Maryland's law last year because a federal appeals court had yet to rule. But the 4th Circuit upheld the measure last August, finding that weapons like the AR-15 could be banned in part because they are outside the scope of the Second Amendment.",
      "But the question of whether AR-15s are protected by the Second Amendment is likely to be soon decided by the Supreme Court. In a separate statement, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the issue is currently being considered by other federal appeals courts, and rulings from them \"should assist this court's ultimate decisionmaking.\" He predicted appeals to the Supreme Court will be before the court \"shortly,\" and said the justices \"should and presumably will address the AR-15 issue soon, in the next term or two.\"",
      "In addition to rejecting the appeal of Maryland's prohibition, the Supreme Court declined to consider a challenge to Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines, keeping the law in place. The court's decision to turn away the appeal from four gun owners and a firearms dealer leaves intact a lower court ruling that declined to block enforcement of Rhode Island's ban and found the challengers failed to show they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.",
      "The two disputes are among several to land before the Supreme Court following its June 2022 ruling that expanded the right to bear arms and laid out a new framework for determining when restrictions on firearms adhere to the Constitution.",
      "Under its new standard, the government must show that a measure is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation and is therefore allowed under the Second Amendment. The high court provided some clarification about its so-called historical tradition test in its last term when it upheld a federal law that bars alleged domestic abusers from temporarily having firearms, but courts have still struggled to apply the framework, leading to conflicting decisions on the constitutionality of longstanding gun laws.",
      "Maryland's assault-weapons ban",
      "Maryland's prohibition on certain semiautomatic rifles was enacted in the wake of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Under the law, it is a crime to possess, sell, transfer or purchase an \"assault long gun\" or a \"copycat weapon,\" which encompasses 45 specific guns or their analogues. A variety of semiautomatic handguns and rifles are still allowed, according to the Maryland State Police.",
      "In addition to Maryland, eight other states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws restricting semiautomatic weapons.",
      "A group of Maryland residents who want to buy rifles covered by the ban, a licensed gun dealer in the state and several pro-Second Amendment groups challenged the law in 2020, arguing that they have a Second Amendment right to own common assault rifles.",
      "The federal district court and U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the law, likening the banned firearms to the M-16 rifle, which the Supreme Court has said is outside the scope of Second Amendment protection.",
      "The Maryland challengers asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court put consideration on hold while it decided another gun case involving concealed carry rules in New York. In that ruling issued in June 2022, the Supreme Court laid out the new framework under which gun laws must be consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "Following its decision in that landmark gun case, the Supreme Court sent the challenge to Maryland's assault weapons back to the appeals court to reconsider the case.",
      "After applying that new framework to Maryland's ban, the 4th Circuit concluded last year that the assault weapons ban is constitutional. Focusing on the AR-15 in particular, the appeals court found that it is most useful in military service and can be banned consistent with the Second Amendment.",
      "It also rejected the challengers' contention that because the guns covered by Maryland's ban are commonly used, they are protected by the Constitution. Instead, the 4th Circuit said adopting this argument would mean that any dangerous weapon \"could gain constitutional protection merely because it becomes popular before the government can sufficiently regulate it.\"",
      "The appeals court also said that the ban is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation, as it \"is one of many in a storied tradition of legislatures perceiving threats posed by excessively dangerous weapons and regulating commensurately.\"",
      "The challengers again sought the Supreme Court's review, arguing in a filing that the justices should \"ensure that the Second Amendment itself is not truncated into a limited right to own certain state-approved means of personal self-defense.\"",
      "They argued the AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the U.S. and said the 4th Circuit's ruling \"turns a firearm possessed for lawful purposes by millions of Americans into an item with not even presumptive constitutional protection.\"",
      "But Maryland officials urged the court to leave the 4th Circuit's ruling intact, in part because they said it's too soon for the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "In his statement, Kavanaugh called the appeals court's decision \"questionable.\"",
      "\"Given that millions of Americans own AR-15s and that a significant majority of the states allow possession of those rifles, petitioners have a strong argument that AR-15s are in 'common use' by law-abiding citizens and therefore are protected by the Second Amendment,\" he wrote. \"If so, then the Fourth Circuit would have erred by holding that Maryland's ban on AR\u201315s complies with the Second Amendment.\"",
      "Thomas, in a solo dissent, said the Supreme Court should not wait to decide the constitutionality of laws outlawing AR-15s and lamented that the justices have put off addressing it for a decade.",
      "\"[F]urther percolation is of little value when lower courts in the jurisdictions that ban AR-15s appear bent on distorting this court's Second Amendment precedents,\" he wrote. \"I doubt we would sit idly by if lower courts were to so subvert our precedents involving any other constitutional right. Until we are vigilant in enforcing it, the right to bear arms will remain 'a second-class right.'\"",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines was enacted by its General Assembly in June 2022 in response to mass shootings that have upended communities nationwide in recent years. The law prohibits possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.",
      "People who had these magazines had six months to either modify them to accept no more than 10 rounds, sell them to a firearms dealer, take them out of state or turn them into law enforcement. Possession of large-capacity magazines is now considered a felony.",
      "The group of gun owners challenged the state's ban shortly before it was set to take effect, arguing it violated the Second Amendment. A federal district court judge denied the challengers' request to block the law, finding that keeping large-capacity magazines isn't conduct that is protected by the Second Amendment.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit then upheld the district court's decision, finding that the ban \"imposes no meaningful burden on the ability of Rhode Island residents to defend themselves.\" The three-judge appeals court panel also said that semiautomatic weapons outfitted with large-capacity magazines \"much more closely resemble\" the M-16 rifle, which is banned for civilian use, than traditional handguns.",
      "\"The burden on self-defense imposed by [Rhode Island's law] is no greater than the burdens of longstanding, permissible arms regulations, and its justification compares favorably with the justification for prior bans on other arms found to pose growing threats to public safety,\" the court said. It added that, when applying the Supreme Court's framework, \"our analogical reasoning very likely places LCMs well within the realm of devices that have historically been prohibited once their danger became manifest.\"",
      "The gun owners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lower courts have \"rubber-stamped\" firearms restrictions even in the wake of the high court's more recent decisions.",
      "\"The same law-abiding citizens who were unconstitutionally deprived of their right to carry arms outside the home before Bruen continue to be deprived of their right to keep arms that are common in the rest of the country,\" they wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court, citing the court's Jun 2022 decision. \"The result is a nation that remains split, with the Second Amendment alive and well in (most of) the vast middle, but routinely disregarded near the coasts.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials urged the Supreme Court to reject the case, saying it is not worthy of the court's attention \"at this time.\" They noted in a filing that the case arrived at the high court while proceedings are still in preliminary stages.",

    "summary": "WorldPride is in D.C. this year, leaving the LGBTQ community conflicted about showing up to the nation's capital amid an administration that has targeted them.",
    "story": [
      "This year, WorldPride is coming to Washington, D.C. A series of events, organized by the nonprofit InterPride, aims to bring visibility and awareness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer issues to an international stage. This year's location is leaving the community conflicted about showing up to the nation's capital amid an administration that has targeted them.",
      "Zoe Stoller, a licensed social worker based in Philadelphia, said they're excited to be among the queer and trans community at WorldPride, but told CBS News the Trump administration has \"definitely been on my mind.\"",
      "\"D.C. is not necessarily a place that many people would think of as super safe and comfortable right now, given the current administration and their attacks on the LGBTQ community, especially trans people, especially trans youth,\" they said.",
      "Meg Ten Eyck, founder and CEO of travel platform\u00a0EveryQueer and vice chairman of the board of directors for the International LGBTQ Travel Association, has been to dozens of Pride events across the world, from the miles-long parade at New York City's WorldPride to a Pride in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2015 that was targeted with Molotov cocktails amid protests.",
      "\"What is happening socially and politically changes the feeling of the Pride that you are attending,\" she said, adding she anticipates WorldPride this year is going to bring \"an astronomical amount of fear and sadness from people\" as well as some potential violence.",
      "\"I think the community is terrified, and I think our instinct as humans is to want structure and to want answers,\" she said. \"There will be a lot of people who are drawn to this particular pride as a giant 'F*** you' to the administration, and there will be a lot of people who are incentivized into negative behaviors that may not necessarily be characteristic of who they are because of that fear and misinformation and general dissatisfaction with human rights violations that are happening in a lot of different ways.\"",
      "Comments across social media have also highlighted the mixed emotions.",
      "In a video about WorldPride\u00a0posted to TikTok\u00a0earlier this month, a top comment with more than 2,000 likes says: \"Being real... I'm not going this year. I'm scared.\" Another reads: \"Couldn't pay me enough to attend a mass gathering like this in this political climate.\"",
      "But others had a different take, including this commenter who wrote: \"Don't let them make us scared we deserve happiness too.\"",
      "While some may choose to skip this year's events due to safety concerns, Stoller predicts their absence will be filled with others eager to take a stand.",
      "\"Folks who may not have attended in the past, might not have felt motivated to show up, to protest, to be in this current political climate and make their voices heard \u2014 those folks might come out of the woodworks,\" they said.",
      "For those with layered identities, navigating Pride this year is even more complex.",
      "David D. Marshall, founder and CEO of Journey to Josiah Inc., a Baltimore-based adoption nonprofit, said the feeling of a \"robust need to fight\" is met with the reality that, for people of color, showing up is a \"a whole different experience\" to White LGBTQ people.",
      "\"There is a fear in general when it comes to Black people, because there is a direct target put on our backs when it comes to any sort of protest,\" he said, adding \"it's a time for people of different privilege, or allies, to show up.\"",
      "And for others, more pressing matters are taking precedence over the problems posed by Pride.",
      "\"When we're thinking about the grand scheme of things, (Pride) just hasn't been on the list,\" Marshall admitted, adding his own organization is grappling with federal funding cuts and those in his circles are \"fighting to maintain our own livelihoods\" amid the dismantling of DEI \u2014 diversity, equity and inclusion \u2014 roles.",
      "\"The option to fold is not there, because the work still needs to be done. The need has not gone anywhere but there are now some additional barriers,\" he said.",
      "Why is WorldPride in D.C.?",
      "While the Trump administration has rolled back several protections for LGBTQ people, especially for trans individuals, WorldPride locations are bid on years in advance, meaning the nation's capital was decided before President Trump was re-elected.",
      "\"No one could have anticipated what was going to happen,\" Ten Eyck said, adding there are fears around what the administration may do if there are protests on federal land, since it would be their jurisdiction. \"(For some people), federal charges result in you losing your career and your income and your stability.\"",
      "But there's an important distinction between who's in office and who makes up the city, she added.",
      "\"Yeah, Trump has the White House and sort of lives in D.C., but the District of Columbia goes deeply democratic in every single election, regardless of who's in the federal administration. So, having and hosting a large global pride celebration is aligned with the citizens of D.C.'s politic and will, but it is not aligned with the federal government stance.\"",
      "Stoller, who has more than 50,000 Instagram followers, has seen this contrast causing discussions among their online community as well, with many questioning whether it's safe or appropriate to attend.",
      "\"D.C. still can be a very safe, open, accepting place. But of course, the people who are in charge, who now are living in D.C. definitely affect the vibes and feelings of that,\" they said.",
      "The Trump administration has already made itself known ahead of the celebration. Last month, several Pride events at the Kennedy Center were canceled or relocated as the institution pivots under President Trump's leadership.",
      "June Crenshaw, deputy director of nonprofit organization Capital Pride Alliance that is helping host to WorldPride, said the organization is finding other paths for the celebration, but added, \"the fact we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\"",
      "According to the WorldPride website, \"top-to-bottom safety protocol\" is in place, assuring the same level of preparation as high-security events like inaugurations.",
      "\"Efforts include pre-event web-related surveillance, on-site security/police, advanced life support stations, roving medic teams, aerial surveillance and anti-scaling systems and barricades where applicable,\" the site notes. \"The 2-day street festival will be fenced with a secure entrance. Capital Pride is augmenting DC's efforts with additional private security.\"",
      "How to celebrate Pride outside of Washington, D.C.",
      "If unsure about attending WorldPride this year, Stroller encourages people to prioritize their emotional and physical safety above all else.",
      "\"If you are feeling worried for your safety, for your emotions, for your well-being, listen to your gut,\" they said.",
      "Black LGBTQ people are also having to figure out another approach \"that may not necessarily be showing up in these very public spaces,\" Marshall added.",
      "\"Does that mean that one group has decided not to fight? No, it's a matter of how. What is going to be the thing that is not going to cost us our lives?\" he said.",
      "Ten Eyck adds there are plenty of ways to \"show up\" for the community without being in Washington physically, including supporting your local Pride party or LGBT center as well as \"putting your money where your morals are.\"",
      "\"If you're a federal employee who can fight from the inside, if you're a teacher who can fight from the inside, if you're a public health professional who can fight from the inside, we need you more in those roles than we need you on the National Mall,\" she said.",

      "Pamela Hemphill is one of the more than 1,500 people whom Mr. Trump pardoned earlier this year for their roles in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection. She has invoked help from her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon Mr. Trump issued her on Jan. 20, his\u00a0first day back in the White House.",
      "Though Hemphill was a defendant of the largest criminal prosecution in American history, she is seemingly standing alone now as the only Jan. 6 defendant to refuse the clemency Mr. Trump offered.",
      "Speaking with CBS News from her home in Idaho, Hemphill said, \"The pardons just contribute to their narrative, which is all lies, propaganda. We were guilty, period.\"",
      "\"We all know that they're gaslighting us. They are using January 6 to just continue Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized,\" she said. \"They were not. When the FBI came to my home, oh my God, they were very professional. They treated me very good.\"",
      "Hemphill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the crowd on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Prosecutors argued Hemphill \"was in the front of the crowd that confronted U.S. Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers attempting to keep the rioters behind the metal bike-rack barriers.\"",
      "They alleged Hemphill galvanized others to descend on Washington for the certification of the electoral vote after the 2020 election, according to court filings.",
      "\"On December 28, 2020, Hemphill posted encouragement to go to Washington, D.C. for January 6, saying 'its a WAR!' On January 1, 2021, she posted a message 'on my way to Washington DC January 6th,'\" the prosecution said.",
      "Hemphill also pleaded guilty in January 2022 to a count of unlawful parading and was sentenced later that year to a term that included three years of probation.",
      "Her case mirrors many other misdemeanor cases from the U.S. Capitol siege, in which members of the crowd were not accused of making physical contact with police or damaging any property \u2014 though prosecutors emphasized how each member of the mob contributed to the breakdown of police lines, the injuries and the damage to American democracy.",
      "Hemphill told CBS News the pardons for her and fellow members of the crowd were inappropriate and damaging Americans' views of the federal government.",
      "\"How could you sleep at night taking a pardon when you know you were guilty? You know that everybody there was guilty. I couldn't live with myself. I have to be right with me. And with God,\" Hemphill said.",
      "Former Pardon Attorney Liz Oyer, who was fired by the Trump administration in March after a disagreement over a case, told CBS News that Hemphill's protest is a sharp contrast from the conduct of other Capitol riot defendants who championed their own pardons.",
      "\"Some Jan. 6 defendants blew up our phones seeking a copy of their pardons. They wanted the copies quickly,\" Oyer said. \"They wanted it framed and signed.\"",
      "Court filings reviewed by CBS News show other Jan. 6 defendants have utilized their pardon certificates to make arguments in court about their cases, restitution payments or other legal matters.",
      "In contrast, senate records obtained by CBS News show Hemphill sought assistance from Sen. James Risch to secure a formal acknowledgement from the Department of Justice that she will not accept her pardon.",
      "In an April 2 correspondence from the Office of the Pardon Attorney to Sen. Risch, the pardon attorney's office wrote, \"Ms. Hemphill's non-acceptance is noted.\" The letter said the Justice Department would not issue Hemphill a formal certificate to chronicle her pardon.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Risch said, \"The Office of U.S. Senator Jim Risch regularly assists constituents with matters pertaining to federal agencies or programs. Due to privacy concerns, we cannot disclose details about individual cases.\"",
      "Hemphill has sparred on social media and in podcasts with other Jan. 6 defendants over her arguments about what she says is the whitewashing of the Capitol riot. In one segment on a podcast earlier this spring, Hemphill debated Enrique Tarrio, a former Proud Boys leader who was convicted at trial and received the longest prison sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Tarrio's sentence was commuted by Mr. Trump.",

      "The kingpin additionally bought real estate including a hotel in Turkey and apartments in Dubai, the prosecutors alleged.",
      "Luxury goods including two Bentley cars, designer bags, jewellery and watches, were also added to the total of illicit assets, bringing the total to $253 million.",
      "\"This is... only a first step towards tracing Leijdekkers' assets,\" the prosecutors said.",
      "A Rotterdam court last June sentenced Leijdekkers in absentia to 24 years in prison for ordering a murder and organizing cocaine shipments.",
      "He is on Europol's most-wanted list, with the European police body offering over $225,000 for information leading to his arrest.",
      "\"Leijdekkers is considered to be one of the key players in international cocaine trafficking,\" according to Europol.",

      "Images apparently showing Leijdekkers in the company of officials as high as President Julius Maada Bio have sparked speculation the cocaine lord has cozied up to Sierra Leone's political class -- including the president's daughter.",

      "Leijdekkers is also believed to be involved in the disappearance and death of Naima Jillal, a woman who went missing in 2019 after she got into a car in Amsterdam,\u00a0according to Europol. Intercepted messages allegedly showed that Leijdekkers \"played an important role in Jillal's disappearance,\" the agency said.",
      "\"For a long time, there was no trace of Naima Jillal, until photos of a woman believed to be her were found on a phone seized in the Marengo investigation,\" Europol said. \"The photos show that she was most likely tortured and is probably no longer alive.\"",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 The United Kingdom will build as many as a dozen new nuclear-powered attack submarines, get its army ready to fight a war in Europe and become \"a battle-ready, armor-clad nation,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed on Monday. The promise is part of a planned military spending boost \u2014\u00a0echoed recently by other close U.S. allies in Europe\u00a0\u2014 designed to send a message to both Moscow, and to President Trump in Washington.",
      "Starmer said Britain \"cannot ignore the threat that Russia poses\" as he pledged to undertake the most sweeping changes to Britain's defenses since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than three decades ago.",
      "\"The threat we face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer told workers and journalists at a navy shipyard in Scotland.",
      "Like other NATO members, the U.K. has been reassessing its defense spending since Russia launched its ongoing, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The government announced its plans for the military in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It was the first such review since 2021, and it landed in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and by the reelection of Mr. Trump last year.",
      "Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared that the era of \"fighting big tank battles on European landmass\" was over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.",
      "Starmer's center-left Labour Party government has said it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and cyberspace.",
      "The measures include increasing production of submarines and weapons and \"learning the lessons of Ukraine,\" which has rapidly developed its drone technology to counter Moscow's forces and even hit targets deep inside Russia. Starmer made his announcement a day after Ukraine launched a drone attack of unprecedented scale against Russian air bases, claiming to have damaged or destroyed 41 Russian bombers.",
      "The government said the U.K. will also establish a cyber command to counter \"daily\" Russia-linked attacks on Britain's defenses.",
      "Monday's announcements include building \"up to 12\" nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds (about $20.3 billion) in Britain's nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret.",
      "The government will also increase conventional Britain's weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.",
      "Starmer said rearming would create a \"defense dividend\" of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs \u2014 a contrast to the post-Cold War \"peace dividend\" that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \"a message to Moscow,\" and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a two-century low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.",
      "Healey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \"on track\" and that there's \"no doubt\" it will hit 3% before 2034.",
      "Starmer said the 3% goal is an \"ambition,\" rather than a firm promise, and it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.",
      "Starmer said he wouldn't make a firm pledge until he knew \"precisely where the money is coming from.\"",
      "Even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.",
      "It's also a message to Mr. Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defense.",
      "European countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Mr. Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Mr. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don't pull their weight.",
      "Starmer said his government would make \"Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation.\"",
      "\"We will never fight alone,\" he said. \"Our defense policy will always be NATO-first.\"",
      "James Cartlidge, defense spokesman for the main British opposition Conservative Party, welcomed more money for defense but was skeptical of the government's 3% pledge.",
      "\"All of Labour's strategic defense review promises will be taken with a pinch of salt unless they can show there will actually be enough money to pay for them,\" he said.",

      "SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk claimed in the statement that Ukraine had hit aircraft at four Russian bases, inflicting more than $7 billion worth of damage on Russia's bomber fleet.",
      "The Ministry of Defense in Moscow said Monday that Russia's air defenses had intercepted a total of 316 Ukrainian drones in 24 hours, which encompasses the time of Ukraine's attack.

      "Ukraine's representatives, led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, were expected to present a plan demanding a \"full and unconditional ceasefire in the sky, on land and at sea as a necessary background and prerequisite for peace negotiations,\" the Reuters news agency said, citing a text of the Ukrainian proposal it had viewed. The proposed truce would last a minimum of 30 days, in line with calls made by the Trump administration previously.",
      "Ukraine was also expected to demand the unconditional return of all Ukrainian children and civilian hostages taken during the war, and that territorial gains made by Russia since February 2014, when Russia first invaded and illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula, not be recognized by the international community.",
      "In return, Ukraine is open to the lifting of \"some sanctions\" imposed against Russia by the U.S. and its allies, \"but in stages and only gradually, with a mechanism for resuming sanctions if necessary.\"",

      "Putin and his senior aides routinely dismiss pro-Europe, pro-NATO Zelenskyy as an illegitimate leader of Ukraine. The Russian president has refused to accept his Ukrainian counterpart's challenge to hold direct personal talks, face-to-face.",
      "Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday as the talks got underway that discussions over such a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting \"will be considered.\"",
      "But there was no confirmation from either Ukraine or Russia that such a high-level dialogue was imminent. Instead, reports from Turkey suggested the second round of talks had concluded in just over an hour. Zelenskyy, who did not attend the negotiations, told reporters during a visit Monday to Lithuania, however, that a new prisoner swap between the warring sides was being organized.",
      "He did not say how far the planning for a swap had gone, but a significant exchange late last month of about 1,000 captured civilians and prisoners of war was the only tangible result of the first round of talks between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "President Trump has voiced frustration with both Zelenskyy and Putin for failing to agree to a truce. During last year's election campaign, Mr. Trump vowed repeatedly to broker an end of the war within hours of taking office. The U.S. president recently issued rare sharp criticism of Putin, calling him \"absolutely crazy\" for continuing to hammer Ukrainian cities with missiles as the U.S. and its partners push for a peace agreement.",
      "Mr. Trump wondered in a social media post during the last prisoner swap whether it, \"could lead to something big?\"",
      "Russian officials were quoted by the country's state-run media as saying the two sides agreed on Monday to hold a third round of talks, but no date was set. The officials acknowledged that future prisoner swaps had been a key point of discussion, but Ukrainian officials said Russia had rejected the call for a broader 30-day ceasefire.",
      "There was no immediate reaction from the White House to the second round of negotiations in Turkey on Monday, but the Trump administration did make it clear that Ukraine had given no advance warning of the Sunday drone attack ahead of those talks.",

      "The May 12 deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause still leaves tariffs higher than before Mr. Trump\u00a0started ramping them up\u00a0last month. Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",
      "\"If the United States and China were to disengage completely in another blitz of escalating tariffs, it would be a really big deal for the global economy,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a client note. \"Demand for industrial commodities would plummet.

      "Warsaw, Poland \u2014 Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%.",
      "The race had Poland on edge since a first round of voting two weeks earlier, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.",
      "An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture a couple of hours later.",
      "The outcome suggests Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by President Trump.",
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban lauded Nawrocki's win, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Nawrocki. In a post on X, she said she's \"confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland.\"",
      "Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister, who is chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.",
      "Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.",
      "Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide \u2014 so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples.",
      "But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared undemocratic.",
      "Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made both to voters and the EU.",
      "Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.",
      "Incoming president's background",
      "Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.",
      "The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who wouldn't be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule.",
      "The strategy clearly worked.",
      "Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with.",
      "Nawrocki's candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \"noble\" fights in his life. The revelations didn't seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Nawrocki endorsed by Trump",
      "Mr. Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president.",
      "He welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week, the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.",
      "A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \"normality,\" as they believe Mr. Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Nawrocki has also echoed some of Mr. Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.",
      "For his part, Zelenskyy said Monday he wants to work with Nawrocki, AFP reported. \"I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation with Poland and with President Nawrocki personally,\" Zelensky said in social media post.",

After years of prototypes and over 500 test flights, the AirCar is finally set for certification later this year.

      "So, how does it work? The AirCar looks like a sleek sports coupe on the road, with four wheels and a design that would fit right in next to a luxury sedan. When you need to fly, you simply drive to a runway, press a button and watch as the wings unfold and the tail extends. The transformation takes about 80 seconds, and there's no manual tinkering required. Once the wings are locked and the tail is in place, you're ready for takeoff. The steering wheel transforms into a flight yoke, and extra pedals appear for rudder control. The controls are designed to be intuitive for pilots, so if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't need to learn anything new.",

The base model puts out 280 horsepower, while the top version offers 340 horsepower with twin turbos. On the road, the AirCar can reach a top speed of about 124 mph, and it handles and feels much like a sports car. In the air, it cruises at 155 mph and can travel up to 620 miles on a single tank of fuel.",
      "The cabin is not pressurized, so the recommended ceiling is 10,000 feet, but it could go higher with oxygen tanks. The AirCar runs on regular high-octane gasoline, and you can fill up at most gas stations.

According to Klein Vision, the AirCar is designed so that if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't have to learn anything new to fly it.

      "Given the number of phishing scams we have all faced over the past decade, most of us have developed a basic skill to spot and avoid obvious phishing emails or SMS messages. Cybercriminals are aware of this, and they have evolved their tactics by shifting to more complex and convincing schemes designed to bypass skepticism and lure victims.",
      "Their goal remains the same: to trick you into handing over sensitive information, especially credit card data. One of the latest examples is the rise in subscription scam campaigns. Scammers are creating incredibly convincing websites selling everything from shoes and clothes to electronics, tricking people into signing up for monthly subscriptions and willingly providing their credit card information. Facebook is being used as the primary platform to promote these new and sophisticated scams.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Bitdefender researchers have uncovered a massive and highly coordinated subscription scam campaign involving more than 200 active websites designed to look like real online stores. These sites, often promoted through Facebook ads, sell everything from clothes and electronics to beauty products, but the real goal is to trick users into signing up for recurring payments, often without realizing it.",
      "One of the most common lures is the \"mystery box\" scam, where you are promised a surprise package at a bargain price. These offers are made to look fun and harmless, but behind the scenes you are giving away personal and credit card information while unknowingly agreeing to hidden subscription terms, often written in tiny fine print.",
      "The scam doesn\u2019t stop there. Once you\u2019re convinced and reach the checkout page, scammers often layer in a second scam, like loyalty cards or VIP memberships that further lock you into payments. It\u2019s all designed to confuse you, overwhelm you with supposed perks and make the scam feel like a good deal.",
      "Researchers found that many of these websites share a single Cyprus address, possibly tied to offshore entities linked to the Paradise Papers.

      "Scammers frequently rotate the brands they impersonate and have started moving beyond mystery boxes, now peddling low-quality products, counterfeit goods, fake investment schemes, dubious supplements and more. To avoid automatic detection, they employ several tactics. These include running multiple versions of an ad, with only one of which is actually malicious while the others display harmless product images, uploading ad images from platforms like Google Drive so they can be swapped out later and cropping visuals to alter recognizable patterns.",

      "Even as scammers become more sophisticated, there are practical steps you can take right now to protect your personal and financial information from subscription fraud and other online threats. Here are ten proactive measures to help keep your data safe:",
      "1) Always read the fine print: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from subscription scams is to slow down and read the fine print, especially on checkout pages. Scammers often hide recurring payment terms in small or lightly colored text that\u2019s easy to miss. What seems like a one-time purchase could actually sign you up for a biweekly or monthly charge. Taking just a moment to scan for hidden terms before hitting \"Pay\" can help you avoid weeks of silent billing.",
      "2) Avoid mystery box or VIP-style deals:\u00a0These offers often prey on curiosity and the promise of surprise or luxury for a low fee. In reality, the \"mystery\" is the trap: you might receive nothing or a low-quality item while being unknowingly enrolled in a recurring subscription. Scammers use the illusion of exclusivity or urgency to pressure quick decisions.",
      "3) Don\u2019t trust ads blindly on social media:\u00a0Facebook, Instagram and other platforms are a hotbed for these scams, with criminals running paid ads that mimic well-known brands or influencers. These ads often link to professional-looking but fake storefronts. If you\u2019re interested in a deal you see online, don\u2019t click through immediately. Instead, look up the brand or offer in a separate tab and check if it exists outside social media.",
      "4) Investigate before you buy:\u00a0Before purchasing from any unfamiliar site, take a few quick steps to verify its legitimacy. Search the brand's name alongside words like \"scam\" or \"reviews\" to see what others have experienced. Look up the company's physical address and check if it actually exists using tools like Google Maps. Make sure the website uses HTTPS, review the site's contact information and cross-check reviews on trusted third-party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports.",
      "5) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Adding a strong antivirus program to your devices can provide an extra layer of defense against fraudulent websites and phishing attempts. Strong antivirus software warns you about suspicious links, blocks malicious ads and scans downloads for malware. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Scammers often rely on leaked or publicly available personal information to target victims with convincing subscription scams. Investing in a personal data removal service can help minimize your digital footprint by removing your information from data broker databases and reducing the chances of being targeted in future campaigns. Regularly monitoring and cleaning up your online presence makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your data for financial gain.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "7) Be cautious with payment methods: Use secure payment options like credit cards, which often offer better fraud protection than wire transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency.",
      "8) Limit personal information shared on social media: Scammers often gather details from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Review your privacy settings and only share necessary information.",
      "9) Use strong, unique passwords and enable multifactor authentication:\u00a0Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, especially those tied to your finances or shopping. Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible, as this adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10) Keep your devices and software updated:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and apps. Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that scammers exploit to gain access to your information or install malicious software.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While the rise of subscription scams and deceptive ads is concerning, it\u2019s especially troubling that platforms like Facebook continue to allow these fraudulent ads to run unchecked. Facebook has repeatedly failed to adequately vet or prevent these malicious campaigns from reaching vulnerable individuals. The platform\u2019s ad approval system should be more proactive in spotting and blocking ads promoting scams, particularly those that impersonate well-known brands or content creators.",

      "In the viral clip first posted on\u00a0Reddit, the\u00a0Unitree H1 is seen suspended from a crane at a Chinese factory, surrounded by two handlers. Without warning, the robot loses control, thrashing its limbs, knocking over equipment and forcing the technicians to scramble out of harm's way. The chaos is palpable, and the images quickly drew comparisons to movies like \"The Terminator\" and \"I, Robot,\" with many viewers wondering if the age of rogue machines had finally arrived.",

      "The Unitree H1 is not a prototype but a commercially available, general-purpose humanoid robot. Standing 5.9 feet tall and weighing 104 pounds, it's designed to walk, run and even perform dynamic movements like backflips and dancing. Its joints are powerful and capable of generating 365 pound-feet of torque, enough to lift heavy objects or, in the wrong circumstances, cause serious harm.",

      "What went wrong?",
      "Despite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm.",
      "The robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of infostealer malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider taking these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0\u200bCheck out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "1. Change your password on every platform: If your login credentials have been exposed, it\u2019s not enough to change the password on just one account. Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Our\u00a0top-rated password manager delivers powerful protection to help keep your accounts secure. It features\u00a0real-time data breach monitoring to alert you if your login details have been exposed, plus a built-in\u00a0data breach scanner\u00a0that checks your saved emails, passwords and credit card information against known leak databases. A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data.",
      "3. Watch for unusual account activity: After a breach, it\u2019s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions.",
      "4. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Keep your software and devices up to date: Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even apps\u00a0need to be updated regularly to patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you\u2019re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Security is not only the responsibility of companies and hosting providers. Users need to adopt better practices, including unique passwords, multifactor authentication and regular reviews of their digital footprint. The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent. In an era where artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and global connectivity are reshaping technology, it is unacceptable that plain text files containing financial and governmental credentials are still left sitting online.",

      "Life before Neuralink",
      "Before receiving the\u00a0Neuralink implant, Smith relied on eye-tracking technology to communicate. While impressive, it came with major limitations.\u00a0\"It is a miracle of technology, but it is frustrating. It works best in dark rooms, so I was basically Batman. I was stuck in a dark room,\"\u00a0Smith shared in a\u00a0recent post on X. Bright environments would disrupt the system, making communication slow and sometimes impossible.

      "How the Neuralink brain implant works",
      "Smith is the first non-verbal person and only the third individual worldwide to receive the Neuralink Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The device, about as thick as five stacked coins, sits in his skull and connects to the motor cortex-the part of the brain that controls movement.",
      "Tiny wires, thinner than human hair, extend into Smith's brain. These pick up signals from his neurons and transmit them wirelessly to his MacBook Pro. The computer then decodes these signals, allowing Smith to move a cursor on the screen with his thoughts alone.",
      "As Smith explains, \"The Neuralink implant embedded in my brain contains 1024 electrodes that capture neuron firings every 15 milliseconds generating a vast amount of data. Artificial intelligence processes this data on a connected MacBook Pro to decode my intended movements in real time to move the cursor on my screen. Neuralink does not read my deepest thoughts or words I think about. It just reads how I wanna move and moves the cursor where I want.\"",

      "Learning to use the system took some trial and error. At first, the team tried mapping Smith's hand movements to the cursor, but it didn't work well. After more research, they discovered that signals related to his tongue were the most effective for cursor movement, and clenching his jaw worked best for clicking.\u00a0\"I am not actively thinking about my tongue, just like you don't think about your wrist when you move a mouse. I have done a lot of cursor movements in my life. I think my brain has switched over to subconscious control quickly so I just think about moving the cursor,\"\u00a0Smith said.",

The system includes a virtual keyboard and shortcuts for common actions, making tasks like copying, pasting and navigating web pages much easier.",
      "Smith also worked with Neuralink engineers to develop a \"parking spot\" feature for the cursor.\u00a0\"Sometimes you just wanna park the cursor and watch a video. When it is in the parking spot, I can watch a show or take a nap without worrying about the cursor,\" he explained.",

Grok helps him write responses and even suggests witty replies. \"We have created a chat app that uses AI to listen to the conversation and gives me options to say in response. It uses Grok 3 and an AI clone of my old voice to generate options for me to say. It is not perfect, but it keeps me in the conversation and it comes up with some great ideas,\" Smith shared.

Despite the challenges of ALS, Smith finds meaning and hope in his faith.\u00a0\"I have not always understood why God afflicted me with ALS but with time I am learning to trust his plan for me. I'm a better man because of ALS. I'm a better disciple of Jesus Christ because of ALS. I'm closer to my amazing wife, literally and figuratively, because of ALS,\" he said.",

And AI can help you brainstorm ideas, outline chapters, even draft content to polish up.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software.",
      "All modern Windows PCs come with Microsoft Defender built in. For the unaware, this tool is Windows\u2019 native antivirus.",
      "Over time, it has matured into a reliable security tool capable of blocking a wide range of threats. However, a tool called Defendnot can shut down Microsoft Defender completely, without exploiting a bug or using malware. It simply convinces Windows that another antivirus is already running.",
      "The implications are serious. This tool does not break into the system or use advanced code injection. It uses Windows features the way they were designed to be used. And that makes the problem harder to detect and harder to fix.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "Windows software on a PC (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The tool works by pretending to be an antivirus",
      "Windows is built to avoid running multiple antivirus products at once. When a third-party antivirus registers itself, Windows disables Microsoft Defender to prevent conflicts. Defendnot\u00a0exploits this system using an undocumented API that security software uses to communicate with the Windows Security Center.",
      "The tool registers a fake antivirus that appears legitimate to the system. It uses a dummy DLL and injects it into Task Manager, a trusted Windows process. By operating inside this signed process, Defendnot avoids signature checks and permission blocks. Once the fake antivirus is registered, Windows disables Microsoft Defender without warning or confirmation.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "No security alert is shown to the user. No visible changes are made to indicate that the system is unprotected. Unless someone checks manually, the machine remains open to attacks with no real-time protection running.",
      "The tool also includes options to set a custom antivirus name, enable logging and configure automatic startup. It achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs whenever the user logs in.",

      "WINDOWS DEFENDER VS ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE: FREE PROTECTION FALLS SHORT",
      "From GitHub takedown to a fresh build",
      "Defendnot is based on an earlier project called No-Defender. That project used code from an actual antivirus product to fake registration. It gained attention quickly and was removed after a copyright complaint from the vendor whose code had been reused. The developer took the project down and walked away from it.",
      "With Defendnot, the creator rebuilt the core features using original code. This version avoids copyright issues and uses a new method to achieve the same effect. It does not rely on another antivirus or third-party binaries. It was written from scratch to demonstrate how simple it is to manipulate Windows security from inside the system.",
      "Microsoft Defender currently flags the tool as a threat. It detects and quarantines it under the name Win32/Sabsik.FL.!ml. However, the fact that it works at all points to a weakness in how Windows handles antivirus registration and trust.",

      "While Defendnot is a research project, there\u2019s a chance that similar tools are already out there and could be used to compromise your PC. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe:",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Even with regular updates, Windows systems can be left exposed by tools like Defendnot that silently disable built-in defenses. A strong third-party antivirus with real-time protection and frequent updates provides essential backup security. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3. Avoid running unexpected commands: Never paste or run commands (like PowerShell scripts) you don\u2019t understand or that were copied from random websites. Attackers often trick users into unknowingly running malware this way.",
      "4. Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and all software applications. Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA on all your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Even with strong device security, your personal information may still be exposed online through data brokers and people-finder sites. These services collect and publish details like your name, address and phone number, making you an easier target for identity theft or phishing. Automated data removal services track down these sites and submit removal requests on your behalf, helping to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online anonymity. While they can't erase every trace of your information, they make it significantly harder for attackers to find and exploit your personal data, which saves you time and reduces unwanted spam in the process.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Defendnot points to a bigger issue with how Windows handles security. It takes a feature meant to prevent software conflicts and turns it into a way to completely disable protection. The system assumes any registered antivirus is legitimate, so if attackers can fake that, they get in without much resistance.",
      "We often think of security as blocking the bad and trusting the good. But this case shows what happens when that trust is misplaced. Defendnot doesn\u2019t sneak past Windows defenses. It walks right in using valid credentials. The solution isn\u2019t just more patches or stronger malware signatures. What we need is a smarter way for systems to tell what is actually safe.",

No special commands or coding needed, just type what you want to know or do, and they respond. For example, asking \"Why is the conclave kept secret?\" will get you a detailed explanation in seconds.",
      "This simplicity is what makes LLMs so useful, but it also opens the door to risks. Instead of harmless questions, someone could ask for a detailed profile on a person, and the model might generate a surprisingly thorough report. While these tools have safeguards and often refuse certain requests, clever phrasing can sometimes bypass those limits.",
      "Unfortunately, it doesn't take much effort for someone to use ChatGPT to gather personal information about you. But don't worry, there are ways to protect yourself from this kind of digital snooping.",

      "WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE",
      "How to stop it",
      "These AI tools don\u2019t just pull information out of thin air. They need to access real online sources to work.\u00a0In other words, your data is already out there on the internet; AI tools just make it easier to find.\u00a0And if you look at the sources, most of the information you wouldn\u2019t want shared online, like your address, relatives and so on, is made public by people-search sites. Other sources include social media, like LinkedIn and Facebook, as well as public databases. But none of them are as invasive as people-search sites.",
      "Let\u2019s see what you can do to limit how much of your information is exposed online.",

      "Although not all people-search sites are required to offer it, most of them do provide an option to request an opt-out. But that comes with a few challenges.",
      "Where to start: Identifying people-search sites that expose your personal information",
      "There are hundreds of people-search sites registered in the U.S. Going through each and every one is, realistically speaking, impossible. You\u2019ll need to narrow your search somehow.",
      "Using AI tools: How to find and list data broker sites with your personal data",
      "Use AI tools and ask them to run a deep search on yourself. It\u2019s not a perfect or complete solution; LLMs tend to shorten their responses to save resources. But it will give you a good starting point, and if you keep asking for more results, you should be able to put together a decent list of people-search sites that might have your profile.",
      "Submitting opt-out requests: How to remove your information from people-search sites",
      "Now, you\u2019ll have to go through each of these people-search sites and submit opt-out requests. These usually aren\u2019t complicated, but they're definitely time-consuming. The opt-out forms are typically located at the bottom of each site, in the footer. The naming can vary from \"Do Not Sell My Info\" to \"Opt-Out\" or something similar. Each people-search site is a little different. Opting out of every people-search site that exposes your personal information is a mammoth task. I\u2019ve discussed it in more detail\u00a0here. Alternatively, you can automate this process.",
      "A woman using ChatGPT on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON'T: HERE'S WHY YOU NEED BOTH",
      "Data removal services are real-time and energy savers when it comes to protecting your personal information online. The way these services work is simple. They send hundreds of data removal requests on your behalf to people-search sites you might not even know exist but are still exposing your data. And with some services, the process goes even further than that.",
      "People-search sites aren\u2019t the only places exposing your personal information without your knowledge. In fact, they\u2019re just a small part of the larger\u00a0data broker industry.",
      "There are marketing, health, financial, risk and many other types of data brokers trading your information. Your data is a commodity they use to make a profit, often without you even realizing it.",
      "Data removal services have taken on the challenge of fighting this threat to your privacy. They continuously scour the web, looking for your profiles. This way, you can just sign up and let them handle the work in the background. And here\u2019s the best part: They take about 10 minutes to set up, roughly the same time it takes to opt out of a single people-search site.",
      "Go to a data removal service that fits your needsChoose a subscription planProvide the minimal information needed for them to effectively locate your profiles on people-search sites",
      "Go to a data removal service that fits your needs",

      "Provide the minimal information needed for them to effectively locate your profiles on people-search sites",
      "And that\u2019s it. The removal process is entirely automated and requires little to no effort on your part. With this small initial effort, you may save yourself from privacy-related risks, including scams and even\u00a0identity theft. But what if your data is exposed on a people-search site not covered by any data removal service?",
      "Every removal service out there has limitations on the number of data brokers it supports. It\u2019s not about a lack of effort; it\u2019s mostly because brokers are generally unwilling to cooperate, to put it mildly. But there\u2019s a way to address this issue without going back to manual opt-outs. The top names in the data removal industry now offer custom removals. In simple terms, this means you can ask them to remove your personal information from websites not currently covered by their standard plans.",
      "The catch is that you\u2019ll need to do the research yourself and point out which sites are exposing your data. It\u2019s not as convenient as having everything done automatically, but it\u2019s a relatively minor inconvenience for the sake of your online privacy.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Being mindful of the information you provide to AI tools is the first and most crucial step in protecting your privacy. Don't share sensitive details such as your full name, home address, financial information, passwords or any other personal data that could be used to identify or harm you or others.",
      "Protecting your AI accounts from unauthorized access helps keep your interactions and data safe. Always use strong, unique passwords and consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store those complex passwords. Enable multifactor authentication whenever possible to add an extra layer of security. Regularly review your account permissions and remove access for any devices or applications you no longer use. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Adjusting your social media privacy settings can greatly reduce the amount of personal information available to data brokers. Make your profiles private, limit who can see your posts and be selective about accepting friend or follower requests. Periodically audit your privacy settings and remove any unnecessary third-party app connections to further minimize your exposure.",

      "Kurt Knutsson reports World ID's iris scanning tech launches in six U.S. cities to verify identity, fight AI bots.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, known for creating ChatGPT, has launched World, a project that uses an eye scan to prove you are a real person online. The idea is to help people stand out from bots and AI by creating a digital ID with a quick scan from a device called the Orb.",
      "While Altman says this technology keeps humans central as AI advances, it also raises serious concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive biometric data, with critics and regulators questioning how this information will be used and protected.",

      "A woman looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How World ID works",
      "World ID relies on a device called the Orb, a spherical scanner that captures a person's iris pattern to generate a unique IrisCode. It stores the code on a blockchain-based platform, ensuring that users can verify their identity without revealing personal details.",
      "Once scanned, individuals receive their World ID, which can be used for authentication across various platforms where the World ID protocol has been integrated, including Reddit, Telegram and Shopify.",
      "Additionally, those who sign up are rewarded with WLD cryptocurrency as an incentive. They get the equivalent of $40 worth of tokens, which they can spend, exchange or share with other World ID holders.",

      "10 SIGNS YOUR IDENTITY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED",
      "Aggressive US rollout targets 180M users",
      "World ID is currently available in Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Tennessee, Miami and San Francisco, with plans to expand further. The company aims to deploy 7,500 Orb devices across the U.S. by the end of the year, targeting 180 million users. While the technology promises enhanced security, the debate over its privacy implications continues to grow.",
      "A man holding an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU'RE SAFE? IDENTITY THEFT COULD WIPE OUT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE'S SAVINGS",
      "Privacy concerns halt World ID from being widely adopted",
      "World ID has ambitious goals, but despite this, the project has faced significant backlash. Many people worry that storing eye scan data in a worldwide database could put their personal information at risk. Adding to the controversy, critics point out the irony of Sam Altman, whose company, OpenAI, contributes to the very AI challenges World ID aims to solve, being at the helm of this project.",
      "Governments in Spain, Argentina, Kenya and Hong Kong have either suspended or investigated the project due to concerns over excessive data collection. Furthermore, cybersecurity experts warn that once biometric data is linked to an identity system, it becomes irreversible, raising fears of potential surveillance.",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "World ID helps prove that people online are real humans and not AI bots, something that is on the rise. In this AI-driven world, it can be an essential security measure to ensure the internet is a safer and more trustworthy place. Since the system is integrated with blockchain technology, it can definitely provide secure authentication across multiple platforms. However, the storage of sensitive biometric data in a global database will always raise concerns for many.",

      "Special prosecutor Hank Brennan may have dulled the impact of inappropriate text messages the lead homicide detective sent regarding Karen Read days before she was charged with the murder of John O'Keefe \u2013 but they're still damaging to the state's case and not just because he used vulgar and obscene language, experts say.",
      "The texts were a bomb that blew up the first trial when they were read with Michael Proctor on the witness stand, and it ended with a deadlocked jury last year. This time around, prosecutors decided not to call him as a witness, and it was his childhood friend Jonathan Diamandis who \u2013 visibly uncomfortable \u2013 walked the jury through the conversation.",
      "But beyond the crass remarks about Read, experts say less explosive messages about Proctor's early opinions of the investigation could be damning.",
      "\"Proctor is mentally begging [the defense] to call him,\" retired Massachusetts Superior Court Judge and Boston College law professor Jack Lu told Fox News Digital. \"Now that the texts are in, they will not call Proctor unless they are convinced they have lost \u2013 the old \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 pass.\"",

      "The new approach comes as President Donald Trump has warned European nations to take more responsibility for their own security. Starmer's announcement focused on a \"new era\" of threats, citing the war in Ukraine, new nuclear risks and \"daily cyberattacks,\" as well as reversing the post-Cold War defense decline. He called out \"growing Russian aggression\" in U.K. waters and skies, blaming \"their reckless actions\" for the increased cost of living \"hitting working people the hardest.\"",

Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and in cyberspace.",
      "The second change, Starmer explained from Scotland, is ensuring \"everything we do will add to the strength of NATO.\"",
      "\"As we step up to take greater responsibility for our collective defense, the NATO alliance means something profound, that we will never fight alone,\" Starmer said. \"It is a fundamental source of our strategic strength. That's why our defense policy will always be NATO first, something that's written through this review. The transformation we are driving in our defense must add up to Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation. So that when we're building new capabilities at home, we are making our allies safer too, strengthening Europe, and strengthening our bridge to the US as Britain's first partner in defense.\"",

      "RUBIO DEMANDS NATO PONY UP, DISMISSES 'HYSTERIA' OVER US ROLE UNDER TRUMP",
      "The third change laid out by Starmer is for the U.K. to \"innovate and accelerate at a wartime pace so we can meet the threats of today and of tomorrow as the fastest innovator in NATO.\" He said such advancements would not mean \"replacing people\" or hardware, but would rather mean \"learning the lessons of Ukraine\" and ensuring \"every capability we have works seamlessly together.\"",
      "\"Drones, destroyers, AI, aircraft, each different branch of our armed services, fully integrated to create an army which is 10 times more lethal by 2035,\" Starmer said.",

      "Since lawmakers impeached Yoon in December over the short-lived martial law order, South Korea has been stuck in a leadership vacuum, churning through a series of acting presidents.

      "Lee Jae-myung, 61, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, has been seen as the most likely next president since Yoon was impeached.",
      "But public support for Lee has been driven more by anger at Yoon\u2019s conservative People Power Party, which has declined to condemn his actions, than by agreement with Lee\u2019s policy positions, said Rob York, director for regional affairs at Pacific Forum, a foreign policy research institute in Honolulu.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think enthusiasm for him is especially strong,\u201d York said. \u201cHe\u2019s not an especially inspiring figure for a number of reasons, but the conservative party is simply so tainted right now.\u201d",
      "Further boosting Lee\u2019s chances is the fact that conservative votes are being split between Kim Moon Soo, the People Power Party candidate, and Lee Jun-seok, a young lawmaker from the upstart Reform Party who has been generating controversy with his antifeminist remarks.",
      "Though Lee has moved toward the center during the campaign, he is generally seen as more open to China and North Korea than his predecessor and less friendly toward Japan, which is part of a trilateral security partnership with the United States and South Korea.",
      "Because Yoon was \u201cso pro-U.S. and hardcore U.S.,\u201d it seems unlikely that the U.S.-South Korea relationship will remain as strong, the Asia Group\u2019s Jennifer Lee said.",
      "\u201cI think that there will be some more balancing act between the United States and China,\u201d she said, and if the Trump administration \u201ccomes out hard\u201d on issues such as tariffs or cost-sharing for the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, \u201cI think there may be a lot more frictions ahead.\u201d",
      "Still, Lee the candidate has expressed support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance and already begun reaching out to the Trump administration. In an interview last week with Time magazine, Lee said Trump \u201chas outstanding skills in terms of negotiation\u201d and that both he and Trump are simply looking out for the interests of their people.",
      "Though he doesn\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s conservative views, Lee has in the past been nicknamed \u201cKorea\u2019s Trump\u201d by supporters enamored with his populist, outspoken style.",
      "Like Trump, Lee also survived an attempt on his life last year, having been stabbed in the neck during a visit to the city of Busan.",
      "\u201cPersonality-wise I think the two of them, if they\u2019re in a room together, would probably get along,\u201d York said. \u201cBoth of them are people who view themselves as dealmakers, and I think they\u2019re more concerned with crafting a deal that makes both of them look good.\u201d",
      "One of Lee\u2019s top priorities will be reaching a deal on tariffs, which have hit South Korea hard. In addition to the 25% tariff, South Korea \u2014 the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy \u2014 is vulnerable to steep duties on some of its biggest exports, such as steel and automobiles.",
      "Lee is also facing a more assertive North Korea, whose leader, Kim Jong Un, has been advancing his ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. Like Trump, Lee favors greater engagement with the North, pledging last week to restore a military hotline between the two rivals, who technically remain at war.",
      "Though Trump has said he\u2019d like to revive his in-person diplomacy with Kim, North Korea appears far less interested in negotiating than it was when the two leaders met in 2018 and 2019. Kim is now receiving crucial economic and military support through a security partnership with Russia, and he said last year that North Korea is no longer pursuing reconciliation with the South.",
      "The heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula come amid reports that Trump is considering withdrawing thousands of U.S. troops from the South, an idea he also floated during his first term. Though Seoul says there have been no such discussions, Pentagon officials say a troop reduction has not been ruled out.",
      "Neither South Korea nor U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) were barely mentioned in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s speech in Singapore last weekend laying out the U.S. approach to the Indo-Pacific, adding to concerns about where the country stands with Washington.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. can unilaterally decide and act on reducing USFK troops. It\u2019s their military, after all,\u201d said Bong Young Sik, a North Korea specialist at the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, referring to U.S. Forces Korea.",
      "But \u201cthey need to consider and accommodate the situations their security partners are under and facing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf they go with \u2018What is good for the U.S. is good for the world,\u2019 I am not sure how long that approach could work,\u201d Bong said.",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong and Stella Kim from Los Angeles."

      "Eating food that lowers inflammation in the body may help people with advanced colon cancer survive longer, according to research presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago.",
      "The findings, presented Sunday, suggest that cancer patients can have at least some control over the outcome of their disease, even at later stages.",
      "\u201cThis is the most common question that patients ask me when I see them in clinic,\u201d said Dr. Kimmie Ng, an author of the new study and associate chief of the division of gastrointestinal oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. \u201cWhat is it that I can do myself to try to improve my chances, help me live as long as possible?\u201d",
      "Ng\u2019s study \u2014 which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal \u2014 looked at the diets of 1,625 adults with stage 3 colon cancer, meaning the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not to other parts of the body.",
      "With standard care \u2014 surgery and chemotherapy in most cases \u2014 about three-quarters of patients can expect to live at least five years after their diagnosis, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "The new research suggests diet may influence those odds.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s unique about colon cancer is that it\u2019s a cancer of the digestive tract,\u201d said Dr. Sara Char, Ng\u2019s co-author and a clinical fellow in hematology and oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. \u201cWhat we eat will inevitably go through the colon.\u201d",
      "All the patients in the new analysis got the same treatment: surgery, followed by three to six months of chemotherapy. They also filled out dietary questionnaires during and after their chemotherapy treatments. Researchers followed up on the participants for five years.",
      "Patients who regularly ate foods that promote inflammation in the body \u2014 ultraprocessed foods, excessive amounts of sugar and saturated fats \u2014 had up to an 87% higher risk of dying from their disease when compared to people who ate a far less inflammatory diet.",
      "The less-inflammatory diet was more plant-focused, and included foods such as leafy greens, carrots, coffee and tea.",
      "Real-world examples",
      "Cancer centers have dietitians who work with patients to make sure they\u2019re getting proper nutrition while they\u2019re going through treatment, said Heather Greenlee, medical director of integrative medicine at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. Chemotherapy, for example, can come with side effects, including difficulty swallowing and poor appetite.",
      "Once treatment is done, patients may need additional help making dietary changes to improve survival long term.",
      "\u201cThe issue that a lot of patients face is that people don\u2019t know how to make these dietary changes that are sustainable over time,\u201d said Greenlee, who also wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Greenlee heads Fred Hutch\u2019s Cook for Your Life program for people who\u2019ve had cancer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important for big studies like this to be done to show that there is this potential benefit for lifestyle and behavioral changes in the face of some of these cancers that are difficult to treat,\u201d she said.",
      "She recommends a plant-focused approach, such as adding beans, broccoli and cauliflower to meals, as well as high-fiber foods. \u201cThose are all good places to start,\u201d Greenlee said.",
      "Exercise boost",
      "Patients also boosted their chances of living longer with physical activity.",
      "People who ate diets least likely to promote inflammation and who did the equivalent of taking a brisk walk for an hour at least three times a week had a 63% lower risk of death from any cause during the five-year follow-up period.",
      "A separate study, also presented Sunday at the cancer meeting, found that regular exercise was linked to a 28% lower risk of the cancer recurring, a new cancer diagnosis or death.",
      "More than 150,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer every year, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "\u201cNot only can healthy lifestyle choices, like diet and exercise, have an impact after a cancer diagnosis,\u201d said Dr. Julie Gralow, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, \u201cthey are absolutely as good as the benefits we see from drugs, and probably even better.\u201d"

      "The memorandum, published in full by the Russian state news agency Tass, was less of a peace plan and more a demand for Ukraine to surrender, defang its military and become a vassal of Moscow.",
      "The conditions, which included Ukraine withdrawing from vast swaths of territory and fulfilling a list of Russian-set conditions, put down for the first time on paper what Ukraine and its allies have known since the beginning of this three-year-long war \u2014 that Putin and his forces \u201care going to have to kill their way out of this war,\u201d a Western official with knowledge of the talks told NBC News on Tuesday, predicting \u201cmore violence.\u201d",
      "The handing over by the Russian delegation of such a maximalist list of demands illustrated that \u201cRussia does not negotiate \u2014 except the terms of its opposition\u2019s surrender,\u201d said James Nixey, a London-based consultant specializing on Russia and the former Soviet republics.",
      "Putin\u2019s Kremlin is \u201cnot fighting a war in Ukraine because of some vague ambition; it\u2019s doing it because it thinks that it is God given right,\u201d he added, and \u201cas extraordinary move from the Ukrainians as this was,\u201d Russia is unlikely to yield until it is \u201ccrippled economically and humbled militarily\u201d \u2014 neither of which have happened.",
      "Under the 12-point plan, Russia would control Crimea, the southern peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014, as well as the eastern territories of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This is where most of the war has been fought since Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Russia only controls parts of these areas and so is calling for Ukrainian forces to withdraw \u2014 another colossal loss of territory for the country that was invaded three years ago.",
      "The document calls for Ukraine to downsize its army, accept \u201cneutral\u201d status between Russia and the West, recognize Russian as an official language, and ban the \u201cglorification or promotion of Nazism.\u201d",
      "For many in the West, this is little more than a road map for Ukraine to be swallowed back up by Russia\u2019s sphere of influence, as it was during the Soviet era and then under Kremlin-compliant leaders such as Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in 2014."

    "story": [
      "These NBA playoffs have defied conventional wisdom about what works, and what doesn\u2019t, in the postseason.",
      "Double-digit comebacks? Playing on the road? Inexperience? Neither has been an impediment for the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers, who have overcome each to make the NBA Finals. The Thunder have the second-youngest roster to have made the Finals in the last 70 years. The Pacers, meanwhile, have thrived on the road and are winning despite historically low odds.",
      "Amid all that upheaval, however, one rule remains unchanged: To win an NBA title, a top-four seed is all but a requirement.",
      "This season\u2019s Finals are the 79th in the league\u2019s history. Of the previous 78 championships, 77 were won by top-four seeds.",
      "The latest finalists meet that criterion. Oklahoma City finished the regular season with the West\u2019s top seed, while Indiana was fourth.",
      "Still, decades of precedent suggest that only Oklahoma City meets the NBA\u2019s even tougher championship standard, because each of the league\u2019s last 29 champions has been top-three seeds. If Indiana wins this season\u2019s NBA title, it would become only the second fourth-seeded champion in league history and the first since 1981.",
      "The lesson: The NBA regular season is often maligned for its length, but that length has also proved to be an effective predictor of which teams can endure four consecutive best-of-seven playoff rounds.",
      "\u201cIf you look at over 82 games, it\u2019s a pretty good sample size to tell you who are the best teams,\u201d said a scout for an Eastern Conference team, who asked not to be identified because he wasn\u2019t authorized to talk publicly. \u201cCould it happen one day that a team outside the top four wins? Could this season [seventh-seeded] Golden State have caught lightning in a bottle, like they did a couple years ago? I think it could still happen.\u201d",
      "Yet it hasn\u2019t in 30 years. The 1995 Houston Rockets are still the only outlier to the top-four rule. They entered the postseason with the West\u2019s sixth-best record and left it as champions of the whole league.",
      "Owning a seed outside the top four hasn\u2019t been a disqualifier for advancing to the Finals. The 1999 New York Knicks and the 2023 Miami Heat got there as eighth seeds, the lowest possible in the NBA\u2019s postseason format. Houston was sixth in 1981, and Miami (2020) and Dallas (2024) were both fifth seeds when they made the Finals. Each case proved that it\u2019s possible to ride a hot streak all the way to the Finals \u2014 but once a team is there, it\u2019s likely that a team that has been better for longer will be waiting. None of those series went longer than six games.",
      "Teams are well aware of the historical link between regular-season success and the postseason and that flipping the proverbial \u201cswitch\u201d from an aimless regular season to a focused postseason is difficult. In 2023, in the wake of the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 limping out of the playoffs\u2019 first round, the team\u2019s top basketball executive said the franchise needed to change its entire approach to \u201cget back to honoring and respecting the regular season.\u201d That executive, Lawrence Frank, even cited the statistic that nearly the past three decades of champions had all been top-three seeds.",
      "\u201cSo you have to earn it,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThe regular season matters.\u201d",

Those Giants are just one of seven teams to have won the Super Bowl despite not having won their own divisions.",
      "Even in the MLB and NHL playoffs, which each feature seven-game series, there isn\u2019t as strong a carryover between the regular season and the postseason as in the NBA. The Los Angeles Kings won the 2012 Stanley Cup as an unexpected champion. Eight wild card teams have won baseball\u2019s World Series. When academics from Smith College, Loyola University Chicago and Skidmore College studied how randomness affected postseason success among North American sports in 2017, their paper found that the better team advances in the NBA Finals 80% of the time, compared with about 60% in NHL and MLB series.",
      "By that count, Indiana has already done the unexpected by beating higher-seeded teams twice \u2014 East No. 1 (Cleveland) and No. 3 (New York) \u2014 just to reach the Finals. The Pacers did it, in part, by maintaining a fast pace and upending the long-held truism that games slow down in the postseason. Can they pull off another upset by beating Oklahoma City, which won 68 games in the regular season by one of the highest average margins in NBA history?",
      "These playoffs have shown that anything is possible. Almost anything, anyway."

      "The corporation said in the court documents, which were obtained by TODAY.com, that Aldi\u2019s packaging is \u201clikely to deceive and confuse consumers and dilute the distinctive quality of Mondel\u0113z\u2019s unique product packaging, and if not stopped, threaten to irreparably harm Mondel\u0113z and its valuable brands.\u201d",

      "According to Mondel\u0113z, the company previously contacted Aldi about its \u201ccopycat\u201d items. The suit alleged that Aldi responded to the request by discontinuing or changing the flagged products. But the supermarket has since, according to the snack company, \u201ccontinued its patterns and practice of selling products in packaging which infringes the trade dress of numerous Mondel\u0113z products.\u201d",
      "Aldi\u2019s dupes have been mentioned by customers over the years on social media. One Aldi Reddit thread compared the grocery chain\u2019s \u201cknockoff\u201d of Velveeta cheese.",
      "An X user posted in 2023 that they enjoyed the dupes more than name brands.",
      "Many TikTok users have also shared videos of them trying Aldi ice cream flavors and comparing them to other brands.",
      "On Aldi\u2019s website, the company says it aims to save customers \u201cmoney on the food and products you want the most.\u201d",
      "The supermarket described itself as \u201cthe fastest-growing grocer in the U.S.\u201d in a February press release. It also said it plans to open over 225 stores this year."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The federal prosecutor who oversaw the Capitol riot investigation is speaking out about President Donald Trump's mass pardon of Jan. 6 rioters and the Trump administration's targeting of career law enforcement officials who worked cases against the people who attacked the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Greg Rosen, who was the chief of the Capitol Siege Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, called the Justice Department's handling of Jan. 6 cases appropriate, proportional and righteous, noting that hundreds of defendants convicted of misdemeanors ultimately were sentenced to probation.",
      "\u201cThe concept that these defendants were railroaded or mistreated is belied by the actual facts,\u201d Rosen said in an interview days after he resigned from the Justice Department. \u201cThe reality is every single case was treated with the utmost scrutiny, and every single case required the same level of due process, maximal due process afforded by the U.S. Constitution.\"",
      "Judges appointed by presidents of both parties adjudicated the cases, and Rosen said the historical record created by the prosecutions \"is what will speak volumes, not conjecture and not speculation.\u201d",
      "Rosen, who was previously a prosecutor in Virginia, served at the Justice Department for more than a decade, culminating in his role overseeing the Jan. 6 cases, leading a unit that was shut down when Trump came to office. Trump pardoned roughly 1,500 defendants and commuted the sentences of members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. Those pardons, Rosen said, sent the wrong message to the American public.",
      "\u201cThe underlying message of the pardons and the expressive nature of the pardons is that political violence is acceptable, particularly if it\u2019s done for a specific purpose,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cPolitical violence in an American society, in a constitutional republic, is essentially the brain rot of the republic. I think Benjamin Franklin once said, \u2018It\u2019s a republic if you can keep it.\u2019 To have pardons ... pardoned people who committed wrong, objectively speaking, and then to celebrate that is a message to the American people that the rule of law may not matter.\u201d",
      "Rosen resigned from the Justice Department last week and is joining a private law firm after a tumultuous few months when some of his colleagues were fired, while he and other leaders were demoted to entry-level positions by the former interim U.S. attorney for Washington, Ed Martin, whom Trump named as his pardon attorney and as director of the Justice Department's working group investigating what Trump has called \"weaponization\" of law enforcement against himself and allies.",
      "Rosen also spoke about the Trump administration's pending settlement of a lawsuit filed by the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to climb through a broken glass door in the building. Trump and his allies are also discussing potential settlements with Jan. 6 defendants. Rosen called the news \"shocking\" and said it was not supported by the evidence.",
      "The notion that Jan. 6 defendants were \"part of some system of weaponization is just not borne out by the truth, it's not borne out by the facts,\" he said.",
      "The public, Rosen said, often overlooks that the prosecutions of Jan. 6 defendants began in the final days of Trump's first term, when Trump himself was publicly declaring that rioters would be held accountable.",
      "Rosen said it should be easy to evaluate what happened from an apolitical and nonpartisan perspective. \"A crime obviously occurred,\" Rosen said. \"We investigated that crime, we brought charges, and those charges were vetted and scrupulously analyzed by \u2014 not only internal to the department,\" before charges were brought, \"but externally, by judges and juries.\u201d",
      "Rosen said the firings and demotions of federal employees who worked on Jan. 6 cases have left the Trump administration less prepared to handle the types of cases it proclaimed to want to prioritize.",
      "\"The irony here is that every single one of those prosecutors, the ones who were fired or the ones who were demoted, were individuals who would have otherwise served the community, served the District of Columbia and helped prevent violent crime in a way consistent with any administration's priorities, let alone this administration's priorities,\" Rosen said. \"Frankly, it's ridiculous that we are seeing retaliation being taken against people who did their jobs and did their jobs effectively with the full-throated support of the United States government.\"",
      "\u201cThis is not a circumstance where we are essentially deep state actors, so to speak. We are just trying to do our jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom my perspective, it sends a terrible message. It sends a message that every aspect of what you do will somehow be politicized or the word I think that keeps getting used is \u2018weaponized,\u2019 and that\u2019s very unfortunate.\u201d",
      "Rosen, whose father was in law enforcement, said he always wanted to be a trial attorney. He was drawn to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington because of its unique status as an office that prosecutes both local and federal crimes.",
      "Now, Rosen is joining the boutique litigation firm Rogers Joseph O'Donnell, as some Washington law firms that have worked cases against Trump or his priorities face threats from the administration.",
      "\"Law firms, whether you are on a firm that is from big law or whether you're at a solo practitioning firm, you should be able to represent your clients zealously and zealously in a way that is not impacted by who the president of the United States is,\" Rosen said. \"There can be a chilling effect. And I think what we're seeing in the litigation across the board, particularly when it came to some of the executive orders, is that firms can be practically, morally and financially impacted in ways that could not just hurt the business, but undermine the rule of law and the ability of lawyers to fulfill their constitutional duties.\"",
      "Rosen said he hopes the record created by the prosecutions of Jan. 6 defendants helps shape how the attack is perceived in history, even as political actors chip away at its reality.",
      "\"What I hope the takeaway will be to citizens of this country is that what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, was a national disgrace and then the prosecution that followed reaffirmed the principles of the rule of law and vindicated the rights and the bravery of law enforcement,\" Rosen said.",
      "\u201cI would not change a thing about the way we conducted ourselves and the honor in which we brought to the court and to the system,\u201d he added.",

    "summary": "President Trump's changes to the Justice Department have fostered what critics say is the ripest environment for corruption by public officials and executives in a generation",
    "story": [
      "For decades, the FBI and the Justice Department have been the main enforcers of laws against political corruption\u00a0and white-collar fraud in the United States.\u00a0In four months, the Trump administration has dismantled key parts of that law enforcement infrastructure, creating what experts say is the ripest environment for corruption\u00a0by public officials and business executives\u00a0in a generation.",
      "Trump aides have forced out\u00a0most of the lawyers\u00a0in the Justice Department\u2019s main anti-corruption unit, the Public Integrity Section, and\u00a0disbanded an FBI squad tasked with investigating congressional misconduct. They have issued a series of directives requiring federal law enforcement agencies to prioritize immigration enforcement. And they have ended\u00a0a 50-year policy of keeping the Justice Department independent of the White House in criminal\u00a0investigations.",
      "All of that came after Trump\u00a0fired most of the inspectors general \u2014 the independent agency watchdogs\u00a0responsible for fighting corruption and waste \u2014 and the Justice Department dropped a corruption case against the mayor of New York in what a judge said was a \u201cbreathtaking\u201d political bargain.\u00a0And it came after the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0Justice Department pulled back on enforcement of foreign bribery and lobbying statutes, as well as cryptocurrency investigations.",
      "Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has issued a steady stream of\u00a0pardons to all but one Republican member of Congress convicted of felonies over the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s dismantling not just the means of prosecuting public corruption, but he\u2019s also dismantling all the means of oversight of public corruption,\u201d said Paul Rosenzweig, a George Washington University law professor who was a senior homeland security official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThe law is only for his enemies now.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the Justice Department said in a statement, \u201cThis Department of Justice has ended the weaponization of government and will continue to prosecute violent crime, enforce our nation\u2019s immigration laws, and make America safe again.",
      "The White House declined to comment.",
      "The Biden Justice Department also came under criticism from groups that considered it soft on white-collar and corporate crime.\u00a0A report\u00a0by the public advocacy group Public Citizen said President Joe Biden\u2019s Justice Department successfully prosecuted only 80 corporations last year \u2014 a 29% drop from the previous fiscal year and fewer than in any year for the previous three decades.",
      "And an analysis\u00a0published last month by the Transactional Records Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University, which uses Justice Department records to examine enforcement and sentencing trends, found that white-collar prosecutions have been declining since 2011.",
      "U.S. attorneys' offices filed 4,332 prosecutions for white-collar crimes in fiscal year 2024, less than half of the 10,269 prosecutions filed three decades earlier\u00a0in\u00a0fiscal year 1994, the report found.",
      "But\u00a0TRAC\u00a0analysts, other experts and Democrats say the Trump policy changes \u2014 coupled with a mandate that FBI agents spend significant time on immigration enforcement \u2014 mean corporate fraud and public corruption enforcement is expected to plummet faster and further.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has ushered America into a golden age of public corruption,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told NBC News in a statement. \u201cTrump quickly cleared out the watchdogs responsible for policing corruption cases at home and abroad by gutting the Department of Justice\u2019s Public Integrity Section and the anti-kleptocracy teams.\u201d",
      "Last month, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, Matthew Galeotti, announced in a memo and a speech\u00a0that the Justice Department was \u201cturning a new page on white-collar and corporate enforcement.\u201d\u00a0While he said that \u201cwhite-collar crime also poses a significant threat to U.S. interests,\u201d he said the Biden administration\u2019s approach has \u201ccome at too high a cost for businesses and American enterprise.\u201d",
      "Big law firms\u00a0interpreted his message as saying the Trump administration will still prosecute corporate misconduct, at least under certain circumstances.\u00a0But\u00a0three lawyers who represent large\u00a0corporations\u00a0in dealings with\u00a0the Justice Department\u00a0told NBC News that over the last several months, corporate compliance investigations of their clients have dropped.\u00a0They declined to be named or\u00a0to cite specifics, citing client confidentiality.",
      "In his memo, Galeotti said the Justice Department will prioritize corporate violations relating to drug cartels, immigration law, terrorism, trade and tariff fraud, and corporate procurement fraud.",
      "\u201cToo often, businesses have been subject to unchecked and long-running investigations that can be costly \u2014 both to the department and to the subjects and targets of its investigations,\u201d he added in a speech at an anti-money-laundering conference.",
      "Revolutionary changes",
      "All presidential administrations set broad policy direction for the Justice Department.\u00a0But more than a dozen current and former Justice Department officials and legal experts said in interviews that the Trump administration has unleashed a revolution in policies, personnel and culture across the department unlike anything in the last five decades, including Trump's first term.",
      "Trump, they say, has fundamentally changed the nature of the post-Watergate Justice Department, in the process driving out hundreds of senior lawyers who helped form its backbone.",
      "The shift began even before Attorney General Pam Bondi took office, when Trump\u2019s acting U.S. attorney in\u00a0Washington, D.C.,\u00a0fired several prosecutors\u00a0who had worked for Jack Smith, the special counsel who filed now-dismissed charges against Trump.",
      "Trump aides said the Smith prosecutors were fired because they could not be counted on to carry out Trump\u2019s orders, because they had prosecuted him.\u00a0Never before, experts said, had so many career civil servants been sacked simply\u00a0because they worked on a case the president disliked.",
      "When Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, a former Trump defense lawyer, was acting deputy attorney general, he ordered federal prosecutors in New York to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, a move that was seen as another signal that the second Trump term would be different.",
      "The move triggered several resignations by prosecutors, and a federal judge ultimately ruled\u00a0that there was no evidence to support the reasons the Justice Department gave for dropping the charges. The judge, ultimately, decided he had no choice but to dismiss the charges.",
      "Bondi\u00a0also paused enforcement\u00a0of a law prohibiting U.S. corporate executives from bribing foreign officials, an area of U.S. law so well-developed that major law firms\u00a0had entire sections\u00a0devoted to advising clients about it.",
      "She also\u00a0disbanded the FBI task force devoted to combating foreign influence and a\u00a0Justice Department group\u00a0that sought to confiscate the assets of Russian oligarchs.\u00a0She also ordered a\u00a0pullback on enforcing the law\u00a0requiring foreign agents to register with the government and disclose their activities.",
      "Several weeks later,\u00a0Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche ended an effort by the Justice Department to police crypto-related violations of banking secrecy and securities laws.",
      "Finally, one of the most impactful moves the Trump administration has made was to slash the size of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, which has dropped from roughly 35 lawyers to four to five, according to two former members of the unit.",
      "Lawyers who work in the Public Integrity Section consult with U.S. attorneys around the country on official corruption matters.\u00a0Their role is twofold \u2014 to assist in cases when needed or when U.S. attorney\u2019s offices\u2019 prosecutors faced conflicts of interest and to ensure politically appointed U.S. attorneys followed the rules in some of the most politically sensitive cases the government brings.",
      "Some of the corruption cases the section was working on are continuing, former officials said. For example, a retired four-star admiral was convicted last month of bribery, but many cases are in limbo, and some have been dropped.",
      "And Justice Department officials say a policy that requires\u00a0the Public Integrity Section\u00a0to approve corruption charges against members of Congress is under review. They also noted that the policy was not followed when the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, another former Trump attorney, brought\u00a0assault charges\u00a0against a New Jersey congresswoman last month.",
      "Flawed past prosecutions",
      "The Public Integrity Section has made its share of mistakes over the years, and some Trump supporters wish it good riddance.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s justice system is focused on protecting the rule of law and combating crime, which is what the American people elected him to do,\u201d Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cMy\u00a0public\u00a0oversight has shown that the\u00a0DOJ and FBI sections responsible for public integrity inquiries were\u00a0a hotbed for partisan investigations against President Trump and his allies.\u201d",
      "But by shrinking the Public Integrity Section, dropping corruption charges against Adams and pardoning political allies convicted of federal crimes, Trump has sent an unmistakable message, current and former Justice Department officials say.",
      "\u201cPublic corruption investigations are being politicized like we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said a former Justice Department official, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation.\u00a0\u201cWhat prosecutor or FBI agent is going to want to work on a case they think Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to like? To witness the destruction of the institution is just infuriating and disheartening.\u201d",
      "Rosenzweig, the law professor, said the damage to America\u2019s image as a country built on the rule of law is not easily fixable.",
      "\u201cGood governance is really a shared myth \u2014 it happens only because we all believe in it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are good because they share a mythos that expects them to be good. When that myth is destroyed, when you learn that it\u2019s just a shared dream that isn\u2019t mandatory ... it\u2019s really, really hard to rebuild faith.\u201d",
      "Rosenzweig added, \u201cIn 150 days, Donald Trump has casually destroyed a belief in the necessity of incorruptibility built over 250 years.\u201d"

      "Eating food that lowers inflammation in the body may help people with advanced colon cancer survive longer, according to research presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago.",
      "The findings, presented Sunday, suggest that cancer patients can have at least some control over the outcome of their disease, even at later stages.",
      "\u201cThis is the most common question that patients ask me when I see them in clinic,\u201d said Dr. Kimmie Ng, an author of the new study and associate chief of the division of gastrointestinal oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. \u201cWhat is it that I can do myself to try to improve my chances, help me live as long as possible?\u201d",
      "Ng\u2019s study \u2014 which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal \u2014 looked at the diets of 1,625 adults with stage 3 colon cancer, meaning the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not to other parts of the body.",
      "With standard care \u2014 surgery and chemotherapy in most cases \u2014 about three-quarters of patients can expect to live at least five years after their diagnosis, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "The new research suggests diet may influence those odds.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s unique about colon cancer is that it\u2019s a cancer of the digestive tract,\u201d said Dr. Sara Char, Ng\u2019s co-author and a clinical fellow in hematology and oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. \u201cWhat we eat will inevitably go through the colon.\u201d",
      "All the patients in the new analysis got the same treatment: surgery, followed by three to six months of chemotherapy. They also filled out dietary questionnaires during and after their chemotherapy treatments. Researchers followed up on the participants for five years.",
      "Patients who regularly ate foods that promote inflammation in the body \u2014 ultraprocessed foods, excessive amounts of sugar and saturated fats \u2014 had up to an 87% higher risk of dying from their disease when compared to people who ate a far less inflammatory diet.",
      "The less-inflammatory diet was more plant-focused, and included foods such as leafy greens, carrots, coffee and tea.",
      "Real-world examples",
      "Cancer centers have dietitians who work with patients to make sure they\u2019re getting proper nutrition while they\u2019re going through treatment, said Heather Greenlee, medical director of integrative medicine at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. Chemotherapy, for example, can come with side effects, including difficulty swallowing and poor appetite.",
      "Once treatment is done, patients may need additional help making dietary changes to improve survival long term.",
      "\u201cThe issue that a lot of patients face is that people don\u2019t know how to make these dietary changes that are sustainable over time,\u201d said Greenlee, who also wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Greenlee heads Fred Hutch\u2019s Cook for Your Life program for people who\u2019ve had cancer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important for big studies like this to be done to show that there is this potential benefit for lifestyle and behavioral changes in the face of some of these cancers that are difficult to treat,\u201d she said.",
      "She recommends a plant-focused approach, such as adding beans, broccoli and cauliflower to meals, as well as high-fiber foods. \u201cThose are all good places to start,\u201d Greenlee said.",
      "Exercise boost",
      "Patients also boosted their chances of living longer with physical activity.",
      "People who ate diets least likely to promote inflammation and who did the equivalent of taking a brisk walk for an hour at least three times a week had a 63% lower risk of death from any cause during the five-year follow-up period.",
      "A separate study, also presented Sunday at the cancer meeting, found that regular exercise was linked to a 28% lower risk of the cancer recurring, a new cancer diagnosis or death.",
      "More than 150,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer every year, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "\u201cNot only can healthy lifestyle choices, like diet and exercise, have an impact after a cancer diagnosis,\u201d said Dr. Julie Gralow, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, \u201cthey are absolutely as good as the benefits we see from drugs, and probably even better.\u201d"

      "Now, even as the initial rapid-fire onslaught of executive actions has slowed, they are vowing to keep up their aggressive \u2014 and coordinated \u2014 posture in the courts.",
      "In a joint interview with NBC News, the Democratic attorneys general, Andrea Campbell of Massachusetts, Rob Bonta of California and Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, laid out their priorities for taking on the Trump administration in the latter half of 2025 and beyond. They said they are specifically looking at bolstering consumer protections, combating what they see as Trump's weaponization of the federal government and stymying the administration's immigration policies.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, Democratic attorneys general have filed 30 lawsuits combined against the administration, focused on issues including immigration and due process, tariffs, federal worker layoffs and the dismantling of federal agencies. California has been a part of 25 of those lawsuits, compared to 21 for New Jersey and 20 for Massachusetts.",
      "Campbell, Bonta and Platkin said they will remain vigilant in responding to new Trump policies while maintaining fights on critical areas stemming from the president's first months in office.",
      "\u201cOne thing I think we demonstrated in the first 100 days of this administration \u2014 and continue to \u2014 is that we are organized, we are strategic, and we\u2019re unafraid to take on what\u2019s coming, whether that be unlawful executive orders or standing up in court to defend our states\u2019 interests, residents, economies and institutions,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about policy or political differences,\u201d Platkin noted. \u201cThat\u2019s not the basis of a lawsuit.\u201d",
      "Rather, he said, \u201cWe will look at whether the president\u2019s violating the law and hurting the residents of our state.\u201d",
      "A Trump administration spokesperson didn't respond to questions for this article.",
      "'Weaponization' of government agencies",
      "One of the most prominent concerns held by these Democratic attorneys general is what they say is Trump\u2019s weaponization of the government.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency has, for example, attempted to obtain access to sensitive Internal Revenue Service data that could jeopardize the personal information \u2014 including the home addresses and Social Security numbers \u2014 of federal workers and others. The data could also be used to target specific people with political retribution, and to push false narratives about undocumented immigrants and voter fraud allegations, critics have warned.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re working closely to support some of these entities through existing lawsuits, whether directly filed by us or amicus briefs,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "She was among 19 attorneys general who sued DOGE in February  \u201cto protect the sensitive information of our constituents, including their IRS data, and ensure that these agencies were not weaponized against our people or against our residents or immigrants or weaponized against our nonprofit organizations or academic institutions,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, referring to efforts by Republicans and the Trump White House to target certain nonprofits by stripping them of their tax-exempt status, Bonta said it was \u201cshocking and remarkable\u201d that the administration might be able to go after such groups \u201cthey don\u2019t agree with based on their viewpoint.\u201d",
      "He said such efforts ran the risk of violating those groups\u2019 First Amendment rights, stating: \u201cWe will be watching closely what the IRS does \u2014 and honestly, any other weaponization.\u201d",
      "Immigration and due process",
      "Democratic attorneys general have been especially active in fighting Trump\u2019s efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants.",
      "And while much of those initial efforts centered around litigation, Campbell said her office was going to double down on efforts to provide legal guidance to immigrant communities in her state so they better know how to avoid or handle such situations.",
      "\u201cThe guidance and the work that we\u2019re doing to ensure folks know what their rights are is just as important as the litigation that we are filing against the federal administration,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThat guidance will continue \u2014 and must. It will not slow down.\u201d",
      "Campbell said that, just last week, her office had released guidance to people who might be targeted in Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids related to \u201cknow what their rights are, when it comes to ICE and ICE enforcement and ICE showing up in their community.\u201d",
      "Consumer protections",
      "Group members said they\u2019d also be active on the issue of consumer protections after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 the federal agency that had handled discipline of such abuses \u2014 was  gutted by the Trump administration.",
      "Campbell, as well Bonta and Platkin, said they\u2019d continue to fight Trump\u2019s attempted elimination of the agency, while also trying to do some of the work the bureau had overseen.",
      "\u201cBecause we now do not have a partner at the federal level looking to advance consumer protection, more of these cases now fall on us,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "Law enforcement",
      "Platkin, for his part, said he was concerned about how many of the Trump administration\u2019s policies \u2014 especially ones related to withholding certain funding for states and related to guns \u2014 had put public safety at risk.",
      "He mentioned cost-cutting measures across Trump\u2019s Justice Department that resulted in the decimation of law enforcement and public safety grants.",
      "In New Jersey, Platkin said that has resulted in \u201ctaking cops off the streets,\u201d as well as the elimination of millions of dollars in funding for items like license plate reader technology, which he said has helped law enforcement officials in the state \u201cto catch violent criminals and human traffickers and drug traffickers.\u201d",
      "Platkin also expressed concern about a settlement Trump\u2019s Justice Department reached last month that would allow the sale of devices that enable standard firearms to fire like machine guns.",
      "Platkin was involved in the litigation to fight sales of the devices \u2014 called forced reset triggers \u2014 and was now reviewing affirmative lawsuits on the matter.",
      "\u201cAs the chief law enforcement officer of my state, one thing that has given me real concern is the risk to public safety that this administration\u2019s policies have created,\u201d he said.",
      "Tariffs",
      "While Democratic attorneys general have aggressively fought Trump\u2019s tariffs, Bonta said the battle was far from over.",
      "In addition to continuing the legal fight, he said he was going to closely watch to see whether corporations in his state might exploit the economic uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s tariffs to unnecessarily raise prices.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the tariffs \u2014 and corporations using that opportunity to harm consumers, to take advantage of them, potentially manipulate pricing \u2014  this is the bread and butter of what we do,\u201d Bonta said. \u201cWe do it in non-Trump times. We do it in Trump times. We protect consumers against price gouging and junk fees and price fixing and anti competitive behavior.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just what we do, and we will continue to do that,\u201d he added.",
      "Bonta warned that companies might see a unique opportunity \u201cto jack up their prices and harm consumers\u201d and that he and his colleagues would remain \u201cvigilant in our ongoing efforts to protect consumers, whether it be due to a tariff excuse or some other type of cover, to harm consumers.\u201d",
      "Bonta, Campbell and Platkin also said they would remain flexible to deal with whatever the next phase of the Trump presidency brings.",
      "\u201cWhen posed with the question, you know, \u2018What do we do next,\u2019 really, the answer is: It depends on what the Trump administration does,\u201d Bonta said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re monitoring all the things that he\u2019s doing,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd when he crosses the threshold of taking an action that is unlawful and harming our states \u2014 meaning, we have standing to sue \u2014 then we sue \u2014 whatever it is.\""

      "The single-engine Piper PA-32-300 Cherokee Six took off from Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford, Connecticut, shortly before 10:14 a.m. and was in the air for about 12 minutes when it went down, according to the flight-tracking company FlightAware.",
      "About 10 minutes into the flight, the pilot declared an emergency and contacted air traffic controllers in New York, who directed them to try to land about 8 miles away at Tweed-New Haven Airport, according to Andrew King, a spokesperson for Avports, which manages Tweed-New Haven.",
      "Tweed-New Haven officials prepared a runway for a possible emergency landing. But air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane, King said.",
      "Mahoney said after the plane went into the water, the pilot used a cellphone to call 911 and report his plane crashed into Long Island Sound and was taking on water. The aircraft was completely submerged when rescuers arrived.",
      "State and federal records indicate the plane is owned by a limited-liability company based in Newtown, Connecticut, and the company's principal is James Edwards. Edwards declined to comment Monday.",
      "The crash occurred near Outer Island, an archipelago of about two dozen islands off the Connecticut coast.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said it was waiting for the recovery of the aircraft to determine the level of damage before deciding whether an NTSB investigation is warranted."

      "Bethenny Frankel addressed social media chatter about her appearance after the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Runway Show.",
      "The former \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star posted a video on Instagram on June 2 sharing more details about what it was like to walk in the runway show.",
      "\"I guess we have to discuss what I looked like on that runway, because the internet is so fascinated with my age, my weight, my face, my hair,\" she said.",
      "Frankel, 54, wore several bathing suits during the runway event in Miami, including a one-piece swimsuit with cheetah print and pink bikini with black polka dots, plus a black mesh cover-up that she took off at one point.",
      "\"Listen, I can tell you with great certainty that every woman that was with me on that stage did not look that way two hours prior,\" Frankel said. \"OK, it was everybody's job, and that's what goes on in Hollywood, in the entertainment industry, and the images that you and your daughters see of women, of Kim Kardashian, of Beyonc\u00e9, of J.Lo, of every famous person, that there is a lot of work that goes into that, a lot of glam, a lot of contouring, a lot of lighting, a lot.\"",
      "Frankel added that she does not normally wear makeup, and that she doesn't crash diet.",
      "\"I don't go to a gym. I don't have a workout. I walk on the beach. Everything I do has balance. I self-regulate so I have a good relationship with food and exercise,\" she said. \"It wasn't always that way. This is not that I have a good metabolism or just good genes, because I used to be 25 pounds heavier in my early 30s.\"",
      "Frankel said she doesn't have issues with \"food noise\" or \"exercise noise\" at this point in her life.",
      "\"The reason my body is natural is because the exercise that I do, and have always done for my body is natural. I'll go months without exercise, and definitely days without doing anything, but I always come back to it,\" she said. \"I have a good relationship with it, and I have a good relationship with food because it's the obsession, it's the extremes, it's the binging, it's the emotions, it's the noise. That is why we are struggling.\"",
      "She concluded by telling her followers, \"I want you to allow yourselves to have, but not beat yourselves up when you do indulge. And I want you to have a good relationship with food and exercise.\"",
      "Frankel spoke more about her experience participating in the show in a June 1 Instagram post.",
      "\"There are so many things I could say about the Sports Illustrated experience. I didn't know much going into it. I mean, I know it's a magazine, and I know that once a year they do a swimsuit issue,\" she said.",
      "\"What I didn't know is what the culture is like there. And I didn't know who 90% of the women were. I will tell you that the resounding theme and culture is women supporting women,\" she continued.",
      "Frankel said the women at the event were not just giving compliments, but asking about what people were planning to do during their walks and helping them with their ideas.",
      "\"I have to say that as much as the runway show was really fun ... I wasn't nervous. I was aware of my age. I was aware that I'm not a model, and there were a lot of models, and I was just like, 'Am I gonna stick this landing or make an absolute fool myself and embarrass you guys?'\" she said.",
      "In the caption of another Instagram post, she summarized the event: \"This runway show was such an amazing experience and I am forever grateful to my community here in Florida and the people for your endless support.\""

      "Jenna Bush Hager is overcome by emotion and admits she\u2019s going to cry.",
      "Standing on a stage at the W Nashville at 9 a.m., in front of navy-blue bookshelves created for this moment, Jenna reflects on six years of her book club. Or, as she puts it, \u201cRead With Jenna is in kindergarten!\u201d",
      "The book club started as a dare to prove that people still read \u2014 the festival, which unfolded over May 30 and 31 and was sponsored by Nashville Music City, is proof that she was right.",
      "Since Read With Jenna launched in 2019, Jenna has chosen 80 books and counting, with a focus on championing debut and diverse voices. Fifty books became bestsellers. And 15 of the club\u2019s authors are in the room at the Read With Jenna Book Festival.",
      "The first ever live gathering of Jenna\u2019s book community and authors is the culmination of years of work. But it\u2019s also the product of a lifetime.",
      "Jenna, onstage, talks about the two grandmothers and mother whose love of reading molded her into the woman, and literary tastemaker, she is. She says Jenna Welch, her namesake, read to explore beyond her life in central Texas. Her grandmother Barbara Bush read for connection and enjoyed reading her granddaughters\u2019 selections. Her mother, Laura Bush, a librarian, read for purpose.",
      "You could say Jenna reads for all those reasons \u2014 plus, perhaps, change-making. In addition to bringing people together around her monthly picks, Jenna is starting her own imprint and having a hand in shaping books that go out into the world. (The first book, \u201cConform,\u201d is out later this year.)",
      "At the Read With Jenna Book Festival, audience members experienced the magic of books. While reading is a solitary act, Jenna believes a shared love of books, and the conversation they inspire, can bring people together.",
      "On the morning of May 31, the room was full of about 200 readers from more than 35 states around the country \u2014 cities including Atlanta, Charleston, Chicago, Huntsville, Alabama and of course, Nashville.",
      "Many attendees were friends, like an Elin Hilderbrand-loving duo who met in high school and Amy Sixbey and Cindy Hedges, who met at a yarn store they later co-owned. (Hedges and Sixbey, who are in multiple book clubs each, give advice for running one: Meet once a month and \"read the book.\")",
      "Another woman gave an instant \u201cyes\u201d the moment her sister sent the event\u2019s registration link.",
      "Multiple sets of mothers and daughters at the festival said reading keeps them together even as their lives diverge. \"We communicate through the books we read,\" Patti Grote of Chicago said, next to her grown daughter. \"Bad on Paper\" cohost and novelist Olivia Muenter got her mom tickets for Mother's Day.",
      "Many came by themselves, like one woman who wore Read With Jenna merch she hand-bedazzled for the event \u2014 a jean jacket for the VIP event on Friday and another T-shirt for Saturday\u2019s mainstage. When a 20-year-old couldn't find a friend to join her, she drove by herself.",
      "The day began around 8 a.m. with breakfast and mingling. On the sunny terraces of the W Nashville overlooking Nashville's Gulch district, longtime friends sat side-by-side with solo travelers.",
      "Before events started, and throughout the day, attendees stopped by the many vendors, picking charms to feature on bracelets from local store Charm Bar (cowboy hats and books were popular options), decorating book-shaped cookies from Butterfly Bakehouse, creating a bouquet from Amelia's Flowers, assembling bags of children's books for local libraries and getting their tarot cards read by Sarah Jane Chapman. They also perused pop-ups \u2014 Parnassus Books, the record store Groove and Shop TODAY.",
      "The itinerary was stacked enough to impress a preteen. When Jenna called her eldest daughter Mila to describe the day, Mila responded, \u201cJenna, are you trying to make me jealous?\u201d",
      "Following breakfast came what could only be called a literary marathon. Stepping through the secret door in the bookcase were two bestselling authors, whose chats with Jenna will eventually feature on the Open Book with Jenna podcast.",
      "First, Jenna spoke to \u201cTom Lake\u201d author Ann Patchett about the nun who taught her to read, running a bookstore in Nashville and why she doesn\u2019t have a cell phone.",
      "Jenna also marveled at the full circle moment their conversation represented: At 18, Jenna and her twin Barbara Bush said Donna Tartt and Patchett were their favorite authors \u2014 and now, she was sitting on stage with Patchett. (Patchett said she and Tartt were chuffed by the Bush twins' answer at the time).",
      "From the back of the room, the next speaker, Elin Hilderbrand looked on wearing a white dress that contrasted with her perpetual Nantucket tan. Hilderbrand took the stage after Patchett to discuss whether she\u2019s really retiring, writing with her daughter and how, after 25 years, she\u2019s ushering in a new era: Adaptations.",
      "She and Jenna also shared some news: They are collaborating on a screen project \u2014 but, as Jenna said, \"We can't share much.\" Hilderbrand's fans (\u201cHilderbabes,\" as they're called), will be delighted but not surprised to know that throughout the day of the festival, the best-selling author took breaks out by the pool.",
      "From there, attendees shuffled between the day\u2019s activities. There were interactive book club sessions with Read With Jenna authors Amity Gaige (\u201cHeartwood\u201d), Emma Straub (\u201cAll Adults Here\u201d) and Christina Henriquez (\u201cThe Great Divide\u201d), asking questions about the novels and answering questions about how they were personally moved.",
      "Later came a chance to tap into their creative sides in workshops led by novelist Jessica Soffer (\u201cThis Is a Love Story\u201d) and songwriter Eric Paslay.",
      "After lunch, comedian Tiffany Haddish took the mainstage with Jenna. Haddish got deep, fast, about how her past trauma informs her comedy, and her revelations about her childhood in the foster care system inspired an attendee to share her own story.",
      "One undeniable highlight came when Haddish \u201ccursed\u201d the audience with joy \u2014 \u201cI curse you with all the joy and abundance and success you can handle. You deserve to be happy.\u201d Another unplanned moment came when she and Paslay collaborated on a moving song about her.",
      "The day rounded out with a celebration of what makes Read With Jenna so special: Its authors (who Jenna calls rock stars).",
      "Jenna moderated a panel with multiple Read With Jenna authors (Coco Mellors, Rumaan Alam, Jean Kwok, Alison Espach, and Chris Whitaker, plus a cameo from Mellors\u2019 son, Indigo). Then, lines formed for signings with all the authors in attendance, a list that included Cara Wall, Diane Marie Brown and Tara Stringfellow, too.",
      "Almost 11 hours after the Read With Jenna Book Festival started at 8 a.m., the crowd gathered to listen to singer Blessing Offor perform. (Holly Williams performed with her husband during the VIP event \u2014 it's Music City, after all).",
      "Jenna, overcome yet again, thanked attendees \u2014 and made, if not a firm promise, then the hope of one.",
      "\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll make this an annual pilgrimage. Until then I hope you connect with us,\" she said."

No matter who you are or what you are, you are you, you are beautiful, and you are perfect,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEveryone\u2019s story is different and everyone\u2019s journey is different.\u201d",

      "Bader shared photos and videos from the milestone moment on her Instagram June 1 that showed her smiling wide and throwing her hands up in the air as she fully embraced the spotlight.",
      "In the caption, she penned a \u201csappy long\u201d statement about why the runway show was so meaningful after opening up about her weight loss and surgery.",
      "\u201cThe past two months since I opened up about my surgery and everything I\u2019ve been through mentally and physically over the past year and a half, I have been feeling quite a range of emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore I walked the runway last night, my dear friend, @noordinarynoire asked me how I was feeling \u2014 and I told her: not the way I thought I would.\u201d",
      "She said she was unsure who she would represent when she appeared on the catwalk because she doesn\u2019t know where she fits in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not plus size, I\u2019m not skinny\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what people wanted me to stand for and I didn\u2019t like not having an answer,\u201d she wrote.",
      "During that instance of self-doubt, she recalled her friend offering some advice: \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t need to have (an answer).\u2019\u201d Her friend reminded her that she is \u201c\u2018Remi f\u2014ing Bader.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd in that moment, something finally clicked,\u201d the TikToker wrote. \u201cSince I started sharing my life online 5 years ago, I\u2019ve constantly tried to figure out which box I belong in based on solely what others want me to be in and that has only been based on my appearance. But last night, I simply just stood for every girl or woman who\u2019s felt lost about where she belongs, but still chooses to show up and put herself out there no matter what.\u201d",
      "She said that was all she needed to embody when she walked the runway.",
      "Bader continued, \u201cLooking at these unedited photos and not wishing to change a thing reminds me how far I\u2019ve come \u2014 not for vanity, but for my mental, emotional, and physical health. To go from not knowing if I\u2019d ever be able to walk out of my house again a year ago, to walking that runway confidently, smiling, and not thinking twice about what anyone else saw, but how good I FELT \u2014 and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never take for granted.\u201d",
      "To conclude, she expressed her gratitude to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit for asking her to participate.",
      "\u201cAnd sorry (but very much not sorry) for the long caption,\u201d she cheekily added and included a white heart.",
      "As she mentioned in her post, Bader has opened up in the past about her health journey. In March, she revealed in an interview with Self magazine that she underwent a weight loss surgery called single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass (SADI-S) in December 2023. The procedure is a hybrid of gastric sleeve and gastric bypass.",
      "She described the recovery process as \u201cthe most brutal thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was in recovery hours, hours, hours, hours, throwing up. It was not normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was supposed to leave (the hospital) in one day. I could not stop projectile vomiting, and I couldn\u2019t drink water. They won\u2019t let you leave if you can\u2019t drink water. I actually can\u2019t explain how horrible it was.\u201d",
      "Bader continued to struggle as she recovered. She shared that she fell into a \u201cdeep depression\u201d that was \u201cthe scariest time of my life.\u201d",
      "But, she said later in the interview that she has improved.",
      "\u201cAm I happy overall right now, happier than when I was dealing with the health issues and the back pain and all those things? Yes. I have more energy. All of my health stuff went back to normal after years and years and years,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "She added, \u201cI think I\u2019ve let so many people take my power away for a long time. I will never regret having my time to heal, and I\u2019m still healing and figuring it out. ... That was none of the internet\u2019s business\u2014these people that don\u2019t know me\u2014and that was for me to figure out.\u201d"

      "\u201cI know, I know. What about Rep TV? Full transparency: I haven\u2019t even re-recorded a quarter of it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it. All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief.\u201d",
      "\u201cReputation,\u201d as many fans know, has a controversial past. The album dropped in November 2017 after nearly a year of Swift staying largely out of the spotlight, following a public fallout with Kanye West and his then-wife Kim Kardashian. (You can read all about that saga in full here.)",
      "The abbreviated version: In 2016, Swift\u2019s feud with West (who now goes by Ye) reached new heights after he released his song \u201cFamous,\u201d featuring a vulgar lyric about Swift, which she denounced. Kardashian later published a video clip that seemingly showed Swift approving the name drop. The singer was branded a \u201csnake\u201d and hashtags like \u201c#KimExposedTaylorParty\u201d went viral.",
      "Swift reclaimed the snake imagery with \u201cReputation\u201d and appeared to reference the feud on the album in songs like \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d and \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things.\u201d",
      "The album demonstrated a lackluster performance when it came to Grammy nominations. But \u201cReputation\u201d has since become a fan-favorite, and listeners have been eager for its rerelease.",
      "In her letter, Swift said now that though she now owns her master recordings, some tracks from \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d may be released down the line.",
      "\u201cTo be perfectly honest, it\u2019s the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn\u2019t be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or the photos, or the videos.

I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away. But that\u2019s all in the past now.

I will be forever grateful to everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever off this to me. The way they\u2019ve handled every interaction we\u2019ve had has been honest, fair, and respectful.

    "story": [
      "When South Koreans elect a new president Tuesday, it will end months of domestic political turmoil \u2014 but their choice could bring big changes to the country\u2019s relationship with the United States.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, had a clear lead in polls going into the election, which is being held six months to the day after then-President Yoon Suk Yeol plunged the East Asian democracy of more than 50 million people into turmoil by abruptly declaring martial law.",
      "Since lawmakers impeached Yoon in December over the short-lived martial law order, South Korea has been stuck in a leadership vacuum, churning through a series of acting presidents. The uncertainty has also constrained the U.S. ally in Washington even as President Donald Trump slapped it with a 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff, among other levies.",
      "The presidential by-election, which was triggered in April when South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court upheld Yoon\u2019s impeachment, promises a return to stability, and South Koreans have turned out in record numbers for early voting.",
      "\u201cA lot of people just want to move on, because it\u2019s been a long six months,\u201d said Jennifer Lee, a principal at the Asia Group corporate consultancy in Washington, who recently returned from a trip to South Korea.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, 61, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, has been seen as the most likely next president since Yoon was impeached.",
      "But public support for Lee has been driven more by anger at Yoon\u2019s conservative People Power Party, which has declined to condemn his actions, than by agreement with Lee\u2019s policy positions, said Rob York, director for regional affairs at Pacific Forum, a foreign policy research institute in Honolulu.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think enthusiasm for him is especially strong,\u201d York said. \u201cHe\u2019s not an especially inspiring figure for a number of reasons, but the conservative party is simply so tainted right now.\u201d",
      "Further boosting Lee\u2019s chances is the fact that conservative votes are being split between Kim Moon Soo, the People Power Party candidate, and Lee Jun-seok, a young lawmaker from the upstart Reform Party who has been generating controversy with his antifeminist remarks.",
      "Though Lee has moved toward the center during the campaign, he is generally seen as more open to China and North Korea than his predecessor and less friendly toward Japan, which is part of a trilateral security partnership with the United States and South Korea.",
      "Because Yoon was \u201cso pro-U.S. and hardcore U.S.,\u201d it seems unlikely that the U.S.-South Korea relationship will remain as strong, the Asia Group\u2019s Jennifer Lee said.",
      "\u201cI think that there will be some more balancing act between the United States and China,\u201d she said, and if the Trump administration \u201ccomes out hard\u201d on issues such as tariffs or cost-sharing for the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, \u201cI think there may be a lot more frictions ahead.\u201d",
      "Still, Lee the candidate has expressed support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance and already begun reaching out to the Trump administration. In an interview last week with Time magazine, Lee said Trump \u201chas outstanding skills in terms of negotiation\u201d and that both he and Trump are simply looking out for the interests of their people.",
      "Though he doesn\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s conservative views, Lee has in the past been nicknamed \u201cKorea\u2019s Trump\u201d by supporters enamored with his populist, outspoken style.",
      "Like Trump, Lee also survived an attempt on his life last year, having been stabbed in the neck during a visit to the city of Busan.",
      "\u201cPersonality-wise I think the two of them, if they\u2019re in a room together, would probably get along,\u201d York said. \u201cBoth of them are people who view themselves as dealmakers, and I think they\u2019re more concerned with crafting a deal that makes both of them look good.\u201d",
      "One of Lee\u2019s top priorities will be reaching a deal on tariffs, which have hit South Korea hard. In addition to the 25% tariff, South Korea \u2014 the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy \u2014 is vulnerable to steep duties on some of its biggest exports, such as steel and automobiles.",
      "Lee is also facing a more assertive North Korea, whose leader, Kim Jong Un, has been advancing his ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. Like Trump, Lee favors greater engagement with the North, pledging last week to restore a military hotline between the two rivals, who technically remain at war.",
      "Though Trump has said he\u2019d like to revive his in-person diplomacy with Kim, North Korea appears far less interested in negotiating than it was when the two leaders met in 2018 and 2019. Kim is now receiving crucial economic and military support through a security partnership with Russia, and he said last year that North Korea is no longer pursuing reconciliation with the South.",
      "The heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula come amid reports that Trump is considering withdrawing thousands of U.S. troops from the South, an idea he also floated during his first term. Though Seoul says there have been no such discussions, Pentagon officials say a troop reduction has not been ruled out.",
      "Neither South Korea nor U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) were barely mentioned in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s speech in Singapore last weekend laying out the U.S. approach to the Indo-Pacific, adding to concerns about where the country stands with Washington.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. can unilaterally decide and act on reducing USFK troops. It\u2019s their military, after all,\u201d said Bong Young Sik, a North Korea specialist at the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, referring to U.S. Forces Korea.",
      "But \u201cthey need to consider and accommodate the situations their security partners are under and facing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf they go with \u2018What is good for the U.S. is good for the world,\u2019 I am not sure how long that approach could work,\u201d Bong said.",

      "The reports were vigorously denied by the organization charged with distributing aid.",
      "Witnesses who spoke to NBC News described chaotic scenes of gunfire at the aid distribution center near Rafah, with one individual who said he saw a tank firing at the crowd. Witnesses who spoke to The Associated Press said Israeli forces had earlier fired on the crowds around 1,000 yards from the aid site.",
      "Mohammed Zaqout, Gaza hospitals director, said at least 31 people were killed in the strike, adding that more than 200 wounded had arrived at Nasser Hospital, 30 of whom were in critical condition.",
      "\u201cTheir injuries are direct gunshot to the head, to the chest, to the abdomen,\u201d he added. Israeli officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Zaqout\u2019s description of the dead and wounded.",
      "'It was hell'",
      "Video taken by an NBC News team on the ground showed a truck arriving at Nasser Hospital with the bodies of several wounded men lying in the back, as bystanders lifted them onto stretchers and rushed them inside, laying them beside other bloodied bodies strewn across the floor.",
      "The bombing began with airstrikes, followed by tank fire, according to 28-year-old Ahmad Abu Labdeh.",
      "\u201cThey told us to come and collect aid, and when we gathered, they opened fire on us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was hell.\u201d",
      "Mahdi Maher Mohammad Brais said he was waiting for aid at 4 a.m. when the shooting began.",
      "\u201cThey were shooting at everyone who came,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were only going to get food to eat.\u201d",
      "Arafat Siam, 43, said his brother was killed while attempting to collect aid for his children, accusing authorities of luring civilians to aid distribution sites only to target them with violence.",
      "\"He was going to get a living for his children, and they killed him,\" Siam said. \"He is not with Hamas or anyone else.\"",
      "Wafaa al-Siyoum, mourning for the loss of a relative killed while trying to collect aid, decried the dire conditions of her family.",
      "\"We haven\u2019t eaten bread for a long time,\" she told NBC News. \"And when he went to get it, they shot at him before he reached the aid point.\"",
      "NBC News journalists at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said they saw at least 50 of the wounded enter the facility.",
      "The Palestine Red Crescent said it had transported \u201c23 fatalities and 23 injured individuals\u201d from the aid distribution point in Rafah.",
      "The Israeli military on Sunday denied allegations that it fired on civilians at the aid distribution site based on what it called an initial inquiry.",
      "Aid distribution chaos",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which began distributing aid in the enclave last week as part of a new U.S.- and Israel-backed plan, said that it delivered 16 trucks of food \u201cwithout incident,\u201d and denied reports of \u201cdeaths, mass injuries and chaos\u201d at its distribution sites.",
      "GHF later shared hours of CCTV video appearing to show crowds of Palestinians peacefully collecting aid from one of its distribution centers. It was not immediately clear when and where the video was taken.",
      "\u201cAs noted in our daily report earlier, aid was distributed without incident,\u201d the organization said in a statement accompanying the video. \u201cReports of injuries and fatalities are completely false and fabricated. Please do not be duped by them.\u201d",
      "GHF was tasked with distributing aid in Gaza after Israel earlier this month lifted an almost three-month blockade barring the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies following warnings of rising starvation in the enclave.",
      "But its first week in operation has been marred by controversy and chaos.",
      "Last week, thousands of hungry Palestinians flooded one of its distribution centers and Israeli soldiers fired live rounds into the air to disperse crowds.",
      "GHF rejected statements by Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run government media office that three Palestinians were killed, 46 others injured and seven people were missing after the incident. The foundation said that no one was killed while trying to access its distribution site.",
      "GHF\u2019s former executive director, Jake Wood, also quit the organization ahead of its operations in Gaza, saying it was impossible to implement the plan while also adhering to the \u201chumanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence,\u201d according to a statement published by Reuters.",
      "The United Nations, which has refused to participate in the plan, has condemned the GHF initiative as a \u201cdistraction\u201d that undermines a long-standing humanitarian framework in Gaza. The U.N. says the effort poses a threat to the independence of aid operations, while simultaneously displacing Palestinians en masse to Gaza\u2019s south.",
      "Israel has maintained that a new aid distribution system was necessary, alleging that Hamas was diverting supplies. The United Nations and other humanitarian groups have said they have not seen evidence that the group was siphoning off aid meant to go to civilians.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 54,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, which has been run by Hamas since 2007."

      "The plan also calls for a full Israeli withdrawal, after which the remaining Israeli hostages and bodies would be released. In addition, Israel would release an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners under Hamas' proposal, which also calls for a \"temporary independent authority\" to manage Gaza."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The concert was set to be small but significant: the first by an all-Korean K-pop band in mainland China after an unofficial ban on such shows for almost a decade.",
      "That was exciting news for fans like Haerin Ouyang, a university student in the coastal Chinese city of Fuzhou, where the South Korean boy band Epex had been scheduled to perform on Saturday.",
      "But the show was canceled earlier this month, less than two weeks after it was announced, leaving Ouyang \u201cheartbroken.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,\u201d she said.",
      "C9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited \u201clocal circumstances\u201d in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.",
      "The ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.",
      "Before the ban, China \u2014 the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan \u2014 was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.",
      "\u201cIn the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China\u2019s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,\u201d said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.",
      "The China ban is estimated to have cost the South Korean economy almost $16 billion since 2016, she said.",
      "But the Epex concert\u2019s cancellation does not necessarily reflect the official position of the Chinese government, Kang cautioned, as China has been gradually reopening to South Korean culture after years of tension.",
      "While K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.",
      "A large-scale K-pop joint concert is also scheduled to be held in September at a 40,000-seat stadium in the Chinese island province of Hainan. The Korea Entertainment Producers\u2019 Association, which announced the event in April, did not reply to an email asking whether that concert is still going ahead.",
      "Kang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would \u201cproceed without issue.\u201d",
      "There are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China\u2019s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.",
      "\u201cIt shows that there is a greater opportunity for collaboration between the two countries, especially in the entertainment industry,\u201d said Ellen Kim, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. \u201cIt might be a starting point for industry-level cooperation that could open more doors between the two countries.\u201d",
      "The diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.",
      "China\u2019s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.",
      "In addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop\u2019s high-spending fans.",
      "China has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever.",
      "\u201cIt now has robust resilience against the \u2018invasion\u2019 of foreign content,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s potential thaw toward South Korean entertainment comes as it further restricts the number of Hollywood films allowed to be screened in its theaters in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "China-South Korea ties could also get a boost from next week\u2019s South Korean presidential election. The front-runner, Lee Jae-myung, is considered friendlier to China than his predecessor.",
      "\u201cIf he wins, it might be a matter of time that things will change, which will allow the Korean entertainers to come into the country and play their music,\u201d Kim said."

      "The memorandum, published in full by the Russian state news agency Tass, was less of a peace plan and more a demand for Ukraine to surrender, defang its military and become a vassal of Moscow.",
      "The conditions, which included Ukraine withdrawing from vast swaths of territory and fulfilling a list of Russian-set conditions, put down for the first time on paper what Ukraine and its allies have known since the beginning of this three-year-long war \u2014 that Putin and his forces \u201care going to have to kill their way out of this war,\u201d a Western official with knowledge of the talks told NBC News on Tuesday, predicting \u201cmore violence.\u201d",

      "Putin\u2019s Kremlin is \u201cnot fighting a war in Ukraine because of some vague ambition; it\u2019s doing it because it thinks that it is God given right,\u201d he added, and \u201cas extraordinary move from the Ukrainians as this was,\u201d Russia is unlikely to yield until it is \u201ccrippled economically and humbled militarily\u201d \u2014 neither of which have happened.",
      "Under the 12-point plan, Russia would control Crimea, the southern peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014, as well as the eastern territories of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This is where most of the war has been fought since Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Russia only controls parts of these areas and so is calling for Ukrainian forces to withdraw \u2014 another colossal loss of territory for the country that was invaded three years ago.",
      "The document calls for Ukraine to downsize its army, accept \u201cneutral\u201d status between Russia and the West, recognize Russian as an official language, and ban the \u201cglorification or promotion of Nazism.\u201d",
      "For many in the West, this is little more than a road map for Ukraine to be swallowed back up by Russia\u2019s sphere of influence, as it was during the Soviet era and then under Kremlin-compliant leaders such as Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in 2014."

      "While there are differing accounts on the extent of the ensuing damage of Sunday\u2019s \u201cSpiderweb\u201d operation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 40 Russian aircraft \u2014 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers \u2014 were hit.

      "Those talks have concluded for the day, Zelenskyy said at a news conference in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, just after midday local time (9 a.m. ET).

      "\u201cI am waiting to hear Minister Umerov\u2019s full report,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",

Carlsen is also a five-time world chess champion, a title awarded for winning the game's most prestigious tournament (The Candidates Tournament) and besting the current world champion (or with the current champion beating the winner of the Candidates).",
      "Carlsen declined to defend the title in 2022, with China's Ding Liren taking the top spot only to be defeated by Gukesh in 2024. Then only 18, Gukesh became the youngest world champion in history.",
      "That has meant something of a natural rivalry between the two.",

      "Along with the embrace of shorter time formats, chess has boomed online, with a boom in coverage and content creators who analyze games in real time and provide plenty of commentary.",
