      "Hungarian authorities have banned the Irish-language rap group Kneecap from entering the country",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Members of the Irish-language rap group Kneecap were banned from entering Hungary ahead of their scheduled performance at the popular Sziget Festival as authorities argued the musicians' presence in the country would constitute a risk to national security.",
      "The Belfast trio, scheduled to play on Sziget's closing day on Aug. 11, is known for anarchic energy, satirical lyrics and use of symbolism associated with the Irish republican movement, which seeks to unite Northern Ireland, currently part of the U.K., with the Republic of Ireland.",
      "The group has faced criticism for lyrics laden with expletives and drug references and for political statements seeming to glorify militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause throughout Israel's war in Gaza and say they don\u2019t support Hezbollah and Hamas nor condone violence.",
      "Hungary's immigration authority, the National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing, published decrees on Thursday declaring Kneecap members Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in, J.J. \u00d3 Dochartaigh and Liam \u00d3g \u00d3hAnnaidh would be banned from Hungary's territory for three years since their \u201centry and stay constitute a serious threat to national security.\u201d",

      "Hungarian authorities and other groups had earlier pushed Sziget Festival to cancel the band's performance. Hungary's minister for European affairs, J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka, noted the government\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy toward antisemitism in a July 11 letter to the festival's organizers.",
      "Hundreds of figures from Hungary's music and cultural community also have signed a petition calling for Kneecap's performance to be cancelled.",
      "The group performed in April at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California, where they accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians enabled by the U.S. government. That sparked calls for the rappers\u2019 U.S. visas to be revoked and several Kneecap gigs have since been canceled as a result.",

      "George Kooymans, guitarist and co-founder of the Dutch band Golden Earring, has died at 77",
      "NEW YORK -- George Kooymans, the guitarist and co-founder of the Dutch band Golden Earring who co-wrote the hard-rock classic \u201cRadar Love\u201d and wrote and shared lead vocals on the top 10 hit \u201cTwilight Zone,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Kooymans' family and the surviving members of Golden Earring announced that he had died Wednesday from complications of ALS, which he had been diagnosed with in 2020. He retired from the band soon after.",
      "\u201cGeorge bore this devastating and debilitating illness with exceptional strength and dignity,\u201d the statement from Golden Earring reads in part. \u201cWe bid farewell to a great musician and composer, whose work extended beyond Golden Earring. George was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, but above all, a friend.\u201d",
      "A native of The Hague, Kooymans was in his mid-teens when he helped found what became Golden Earring in the early 1960s: The band's name was inspired by an instrumental of the time, \u201cGolden Earrings.\u201d He was also a core member of the group's best known lineup, which featured drummer Cesar Zuiderwijk, singer-guitarist Barry Hay and bassist-keyboardist Rinus Gerritsen and stayed together from 1970 until Koosyman's departure.",
      "With more than 20 top 10 singles in their native country, Golden Earring had more success at home than overseas. But they began to attract an underground following in the U.S. in the late 1960s and broke through commercially in 1973 with the worldwide hit \u201cRadar Love,\" which has been covered by U2, R.E.M. and hundreds of others and used on the soundtrack to \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d \u201cWayne's World 2\u201d and other films.",
      "\u201cRadar Love,\u201d with its stately opening riff and memorable opening line \u201cI\u2019ve been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheel,\u201d was once ranked by Rolling Stone as among the greatest road trip songs.",

      "Golden Earring continued to tour and record in the 1990s and beyond.

      "\u201cGetting to see the real, true him that the world gets to remember him for, which you\u2019ll see on this show, is just a beautiful thing,\u201d says the Backstreet Boys\u2019 AJ McLean, the show\u2019s host.",

      "The first batch of episodes premiered in early July and the last few episodes, including the finale, will drop Wednesday. The show ultimately follows six bands working to develop their group sound and performances \u2014 until only one band is left standing, winning the $500,000 prize.",
      "The show is hosted by McLean, with Pussycat Dolls frontwoman \u2014 and newly minted Tony winner \u2014 Nicole Scherzinger mentoring the bands and Destiny\u2019s Child star Kelly Rowland serving as a guest judge alongside Payne.",
      "The series opened with a dedication to Payne and his family, in which McLean said they \u201cnever imagined we'd soon be saying goodbye to our friend\u201d while filming the show.",
      "Payne first appears in the seventh episode for the showcase, where each band performs in front of a live audience and the judges, only about a week after they form.",
      "\u201cWe were amazing dancers, obviously, in One Direction,\u201d Payne joked in the episode while offering critiques to boy band Midnight \u2019til Morning, whose members expressed hesitations with dancing onstage. Band member Mason Watts then revealed his family had won tickets to sit front row at a One Direction concert when he was 11, stoking applause from the crowd and a heartfelt response from Payne.",
      "\u201cEver since that moment, I wanted to be in a group,\u201d Watts, originally from Australia, said in the episode. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a full-circle moment to be here with a group and performing in front of you. So, thank you, man.\u201d",

      "Payne is seen nodding along with excitement during the band's showcase performance, when they sang \u201cSure Thing\u201d by Miguel. Bradley Rittmann, another Soulidified member, told the AP they were \u201con Cloud 9\u201d after Payne said he would join their band.",

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast's new CEO hit Wall Street Wednesday as YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson's media empire looks to develop long-term brand partnerships and, in turn, unlock more funding for its charitable content.",
      "Venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold took over MrBeast leadership last summer with a mandate to professionalize an ever-growing entertainment company. YouTube's most popular creator had reached record audience levels far outpacing its startup days, while vowing to reassess its internal culture amid multiple controversies. But, despite joining Nasdaq's closing bell ceremony on Wednesday, Housenbold said their strategic plan does not currently include a public offering \u2014 or any active funding rounds.",
      "\u201cDo I want to make banger content? Yeah. That\u2019s cool,\" Housenbold told The Associated Press. \"But what can we do with that banger content? Generate profits, make a sustainable business that gives us greater ability to impact people\u2019s lives around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching quickly to profitability, so we don\u2019t have to raise additional capital,\u201d he added.",
      "Instead, MrBeast is focused on securing multi-year exclusive advertising deals as opposed to single-video brand partnerships. With 416 million subscribers and legions of impressionable young fans, Housenbold argued that MrBeast is uniquely positioned to deliver more bang for companies' marketing bucks by pointing that \u201cfirehouse of attention\u201d at them.",
      "Along the way, Housenbold said he is encouraging Donaldson to tout the channel's charitable works \u2014 which often feature quantifiable stunts such as building wells, removing ocean plastic or covering cataract surgery costs. The company, in his view, \u201ccan do good while doing well.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more people who like us \u2019cause we do good, the more people watch our videos,\" he said. \u201cThe more people watch our videos, the more we\u2019re able to drive in fees from our advertising partners... the more we can invest in more content to do more good in the world.\u201d",
      "New projects such as the Amazon Prime reality show and a James Patterson novel from HarperCollins aim to diversify the genders and ages of his audience. Housenbold said that base has historically consisted mostly of 8-to-25-year-olds and men.",
      "But Housenbold acknowledged missteps in last year's production of \u201cBeast Games,\" which prompted allegations of \u201cunsafe\u201d conditions from some contestants who said an unorganized set led to injuries, irregular food provision and lacking access to medication. While describing most of those reports as \u201cinaccurate,\u201d Housenbold said they were \u201cbetter prepared\u201d for the second season's recently wrapped shoot.",

The album will also receive a CD and digital release for the first time, and the opening track, \u201cCrying in the Night,\u201d was available to stream Wednesday.",
      "Buckingham and Nicks were in their early to mid-20s during the making of their album. \u201cIt was a very natural thing, from the beginning,\u201d Nicks says in the re-release's liner notes, written by music journalist David Fricke.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it will once again withdraw from the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, an expected move that has the U.S. further retreating from international organizations.",
      "The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency of promoting anti-Israel speech.",
      "The decision, which won't go into effect until December 2026, will deal a blow to an agency known for preserving cultural heritage through its UNESCO World Heritage Sites program \u2014 which recognizes significant landmarks for protection, ranging from the Taj Mahal to Egypt's pyramids of Giza and the Grand Canyon National Park. The agency also empowers education and science across the globe.",
      "It is the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to pull support for U.N. agencies under a larger campaign to reshape U.S. diplomacy. Under the \"America First\" approach, the administration has pulled out of the U.N. World Health Organization and the top U.N. human rights body, while reassessing its funding for others. This has left the U.N., which is in the process of its own massive overhaul, reevaluating core programs and initiatives and what the international body would look like without support from the U.S. \u2014 its largest donor.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement that the withdrawal was linked to UNESCO\u2019s perceived agenda to \u201cadvance divisive social and cultural causes.\u201d",
      "She added that UNESCO\u2019s decision in 2011 \u201cto admit the \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.\u201d",
      "UNESCO director general Audrey Azoulay said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets the U.S. decision but said it was expected and that the agency \u201chas prepared for it.\u201d She also denied accusations of anti-Israel bias, saying it contradicts \u201cthe reality of UNESCO\u2019s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Azoulay added that \u201cthe reasons put forward by the United States of America are the same as seven years ago, even though the situation has changed profoundly, political tensions have receded, and UNESCO today constitutes a rare forum for consensus on concrete and action-oriented multilateralism.\"",
      "Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., celebrated the announcement, saying in a statement that it is a \u201cfitting response to the consistent misguided anti-Israel bias of UNESCO, an organization that has lost its way.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration had rejoined UNESCO in 2023 after citing concerns that China was filling the gap left by the U.S. in UNESCO policymaking, notably in setting standards for artificial intelligence and technology education.",

      "The withdrawal, which was first reported by the New York Post, came after a review ordered by the Trump administration earlier this year. While the U.S. had previously provided a notable share of the agency\u2019s budget, UNESCO has diversified its funding sources in recent years as the U.S. contribution has decreased. Today, American assistance represents only 8% of the agency\u2019s total budget.",
      "Bruce hinted later Tuesday that further U.S. withdrawal from international organizations could be coming as a result of the ongoing review to ensure \u201ccontinued U.S. participation in international organizations will focus on advancing American interests with clarity and conviction.\u201d",

      "The larger-than-life frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath Ozzy Osbourne has died",
      "NEW YORK -- There are pioneering music figures, and then there is Ozzy Osbourne, the larger-than-life frontman of Black Sabbath, whose personal mythology is eclipsed only by the strength and immortality of his songs.",
      "A godfather and force of heavy metal, Osbourne died Tuesday at 76, just weeks after his last performance.",
      "The English icon's idiosyncratic, throaty voice launched generations of metalheads, both through his work at the reins of Black Sabbath and in his solo career. Across his repertoire, there are songs with total global ubiquity and lesser-known innovations with his unique, spooky aesthetic quality.",
      "To celebrate Osbourne\u2019s life and legacy, we've selected just a few songs that made the man, from timeless tunes to a few left-of-center selections.",
      "Read on and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist.",
      "It would be a challenge to name a more immediately recognizable guitar riff than the one that launches Black Sabbath's 1970 megahit \u201cIron Man.\u201d It transcends the metal genre \u2014 an all-timer heard around the world and in guitar stores everywhere.",
      "One of the great Vietnam War protest songs, Black Sabbath's \u201cWar Pigs\u201d is a rare moment where hippies and metalheads can agree: \u201cPoliticians hide themselves away / They only started the war / Why should they go out to fight?\u201d Osbourne sings in the bridge.",
      "Osbourne's heaviest performances are at least partially indebted to Black Sabbath's bassist and lyricist Terry \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler, and there is perhaps no better example than \u201cChildren of the Grave,\u201d the single from the band's 1971 album, \u201cMaster of Reality.\u201d \u201cMust the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?\u201d Osbourne embodies Butler's words, a sonic fist lifted in the air. \u201cCan they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?\u201d",
      "Black Sabbath were in a creative rut in the time period leading up to \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath,\u201d the opening track from their 1973 album of the same name. It's almost hard to believe now \u2014 the song features one of their best-known riffs, and its chorus features some truly ascendant vocals.",

      "Would the world know what a vibraslap sounds like without the immediately recognizable introduction to Osbourne's first solo single, \u201cCrazy Train?\u201d To call it a classic is almost a disservice \u2014 it is an addicting tune, complete with chugging guitars and Cold War-era fears.",
      "Another classic cut from Osbourne's debut solo album, \u201cBlizzard Of Ozz\u201d \u2014 released one year after Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath for his legendary excesses, \u2014 the arena rock anthem \u201cMr. Crowley\u201d pays tribute to the famed English occultist Aleister Crowley and features Deep Purple's Don Airey on keyboard.",
      "The title track and coda of Osbourne's second solo studio album, \u201cDiary of a Madman,\u201d runs over six minutes long, features big strings and a choir so theatrical it sounds like they're scoring a medieval war film. He wanted big, he wanted dramatic, and he nailed it.",
      "It wouldn't be inaccurate to call \u201cMama, I'm Coming Home\u201d a beautiful-sounding song. It's unlike anything on this list, a power ballad featuring lyrics written by the late Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Lemmy and a welcomed deviation.",
      "When Black Sabbath comes to mind, most fans jump to an unimpeachable run of albums released in the '70s and early \u201980s. But \u201cI,\u201d a cut from Black Sabbath's too often overlooked 16th studio album, \u201cDehumanizer,\u201d is worth your ear. And not only because it is the first Sabbath album to feature singer Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice since 1981's \u201cMob Rules,\u201d though that's an obvious plus.",
      "Late in life Ozzy Osbourne was generous with his time and talent, often collaborating with younger performers who idolized the metal legend. One such example is Post Malone's \u201cTake What You Want,\u201d which also features the rapper Travis Scott. Osbourne gives the song a necessary gothic edge \u2014 validating the otherwise balladic song's use of a sprightly guitar solo.",

      "During its relatively short run from 2002 to 2005, \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d became a runaway hit and made stars of his wife Sharon and kids Jack and Kelly. But more than that, it made a star of the domesticated version of Ozzy Osbourne, and in the process changed reality TV.",
      "In 2025, when virtually every variety of celebrity has had a reality show, it's hard to see what a novelty the series was. MTV sold it as television's first \u201creality sitcom.\"",
      "\u201cJust the idea of the Black Sabbath founder, who will forever be known for biting the head off a bat during a 1982 concert, as a family man seems strange,\u201d Associated Press Media Writer David Bauder wrote on the eve of \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d premiere. But on the show, Osbourne was \"sweetly funny \u2014 and under everything a lot like the put-upon dads you\u2019ve been seeing in television sitcoms for generations.\u201d",

      "They sat on the couch. They ate dinner. The now-sober Ozzy sipped Diet Cokes, and urged his kids not to indulge in alcohol or drugs when they went out. He struggled to find the History Channel on his satellite TV. They feuded with the neighbors because, of all things, their loud music was driving the Osbournes crazy.",
      "\u201cYou were seeing this really fascinating, appealing, bizarre tension between the public persona of a celebrity and their mundane experiences at home,\u201d said Kathryn VanArendonk, a critic for Vulture and New York Magazine.",

      "The red-and-white bike \u2014 or as Pee-wee calls it in the movie, \u201cthe best bike in the whole world\" \u2014 is adorned with streamers on the handlebars and a lion emblem at the front. Huhn said it was acquired from an auction in Los Angeles.",

      "ERIE, Pa. -- Besides being a fan, John Oliver has had a certain affinity for minor league baseball.",
      "On Saturday night, the comedian and host of HBO's \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d saw his latest crazy creation set out into the world as the Erie Moon Mammoths made their debut in front of a record crowd of 7,070 at UPMC Park.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending our furry child out into the world and you are the custodian of it. Now, please be careful with our child,\u201d Oliver said a couple of hours before the Moon Mammoths took the field against the Chesapeake Oyster Catchers.",
      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals on why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo have so many teams expressing interest was really edifying. I think it kind of validates the fact that we thought there was something special about minor league baseball. We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.\u201d",
      "That this came together in less than three months is a minor miracle. It usually takes 16 months for a team to have an alternate identity approved and then take the field.",
      "\u201cI thought we had a good chance when I sent it in. And then when we were selected it was a little surreal,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd since then working with the \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 team, they've been wonderful and detail oriented.\u201d",
      "The Moon Mammoths name was inspired by George Moon, who found the bone of a prehistoric mammoth while scuba diving in 1991. The remains are housed at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Moon has become a regional celebrity since the rebranding was announced. He was at the game and caught the ceremonial first pitch from Oliver.",

      "Coleman said that since the Moon Mammoths were unveiled, the team has done the equivalent of four years' of online sales in three weeks. The line of people waiting to get into the team store, which was located in left field, stretched out to near home plate in the concourse area.",
      "Karyn Drombosky and Sean Mizerski drove from Pittsburgh and were wearing homemade tusks as they waited to get into the team store.",

There\u2019s so much silliness,\u201d Drombosky said. \u201cWe watch John Oliver pretty regularly. We were like surprised but excited when we saw he picked the Erie team to take over.\u201d",

      "Erie trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the ninth but got within one run on Kevin McGonigle's two-run double. Chesapeake's Yaqui Rivera struck out Josue Brice\u00f1o with the bases loaded to end the game.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was great. Everything worked smoothly. It doesn\u2019t happen very often in minor league baseball to be able to have an event like that. It was a fun night for everyone,\u201d Erie manager Andrew Graham said.",
      "The Moon Mammoths will be back on Aug. 19 as well as Sept. 12 and 13. Coleman said there will be at least four Moon Mammoths games next season.",
      "\u201cI love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

      "The NBA Summer League in Las Vegas has become more than just basketball",
      "LAS VEGAS -- While Bronny James and other young talent were lighting up the NBA Summer League court in Las Vegas, another game was being played just a few steps away: One with scripts, storyboards and studio buzz.",
      "Inside the Thomas & Mack Center, just as the league wrapped up Sunday, a different kind of crowd formed. Hollywood execs, producers and curious power players were slipping away from the basketball action to catch a slate of 34 film projects created by NBA stars past and present.",
      "More than just film screenings, it\u2019s an emerging playground where sports and the art of storytelling collide. From baseline to backlot, the Summer League Film Festival is generating off-court buzz \u2014 with the likes of Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett, actor-producer Mark Wahlberg and filmmaker Deon Taylor joining the mix. Conversations are building on turning this three-day showcase into a launchpad for athlete-filmmakers, backed by film industry veterans who understand both the creative and business sides of shaping ideas and grooming projects for the screen.",
      "\u201cThis definitely has legs,\u201d said retired NBA player Stacey Augmon after previewing \u201cUNLV: Kings of Vegas,\u201d a documentary chronicling the untold story of the Runnin\u2019 Rebels in the Strip View Pavilion. A 10-minute clip was screened before a packed audience, including Sundance Film Festival director Michelle Satter and production companies like the Wahlberg co-owned Unrealistic Ideas and Alcon Entertainment, the company behind \u201cThe Book of Eli\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d",
      "Like other entries, the \u201cKings of Vegas\u201d team showcased select footage, including interviews with high-profile names such as Snoop Dogg, Chuck D and Jimmy Kimmel, alongside UNLV legends Augmon, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony and others. After the screening, the producers and cast discussed the film\u2019s origins, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.",
      "The documentary remains in development, but Augmon says the film festival is already proving its worth.",
      "\u201cThis gives us another great avenue,\u201d said Augmon, who played on the Runnin' Rebels team that won the 1990 NCAA championship before his 15-season NBA career. His college teammate, Anderson Hunt, said sharing their authentic, real-life stories offer a major advantage like never before, unlocking new pathways to getting their projects financed and sold.",
      "\u201cWe have control of what's coming out,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople might know about our stories through the internet. But stuff like this takes our platform to the next level. This is great for us, and Deon is like a golden child.\u201d",
      "The festival spotlighted stories produced by NBA stars past and present including Nikola Jokic, Luguentz Dort, Tony Allen, Nate Robinson, Kyle Anderson, Cole Anthony, Keyon Dooling and Udonis Haslem.",
      "Deon and Roxanne Avent Taylor of Hidden Empire Film Group were tapped to infuse the festival with seasoned filmmaking expertise, helping bridge the worlds of sports and entertainment. He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players. He added that having Wahlberg and Archie Gips of Unrealistic Ideas on board brings more industry muscle to strengthen the initiative and help drive it forward.",

You can do that if you've lived and experienced it. You can't do that from a high-rise building with no pain. These guys come from adversity in life and sports.\u201d",
      "EverWonder Studio president Michael Antinoro certainly thinks so, and then some. He sees the film festival as more than a one-off spectacle in Las Vegas.",
      "In Antinoro's eyes, it could become the Oscars of athlete-driven storytelling with satellite versions popping up in the NBA arenas throughout the season. He sees value in helping standout projects secure the final funding and reach the right distributors.",
      "\u201cIf we can add any value, we\u2019re in the rooms talking to all the networks and streamers that distributes films,\u201d said Antinoro, a founding partner of the studio, which specializes in nonfiction content, documentaries and live events. The company served as co-executive producer on \u201cDefiant: The Manny Pacquiao Obsession\u201d in 2019 and produced projects featuring Mike Tyson and Brett Favre.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to them a lot. It\u2019s all about exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these films maybe need a little more money just to get them over the line. If it makes sense, we can play a little there too.\u201d",
      "For Michelle Satter, it\u2019s all about fostering a supportive creative community. She sees promising potential in what\u2019s taking shape at the Summer League Film Festival.",
      "While it\u2019s still early, Satter can envision a future where projects from the festival eventually find their way into Sundance.",
      "\u201cWhy not? Of course,\u201d said Satter, a founding figure at Sundance since 1981. She now serves as the founding senior director of Sundance Institute's artist programs. She's exploring how it might support the festival after being invited by Taylor.",
      "Sundance already has an existing partnership with Taylor\u2019s Hidden Empire. She called the opportunity to collaborate on this new venture both exciting and aligned with Sundance\u2019s mission to uplift emerging voices in storytelling.",
      "Satter's late son, Michael Latt, had his documentary short \u201cHoops, Hopes & Dreams\u201d premiere at Sundance early this year. She said Sundance gets about 15,000 short film submissions each year, but there\u2019s room for compelling storytelling that opens up new perspective from an athlete\u2019s lens.",
      "\u201cThat was the power of storytelling, the unity of sports and bringing people together in community,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the idea. These are the stories people need to see. They need to be out there in the world.\u201d",

      "Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to",
      "The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah\u2019s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination.",
      "The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic as much as 10 times the federal limit. Smith had to put the rural park under a do-not-drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe Health Department refers it to us like ... \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys regulating it?\u2019 We had no idea it existed,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans\u2019 water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can\u2019t always count on those basic protections.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And the problems are likely even bigger because the EPA database doesn\u2019t catch all parks.",
      "Even where parks get water from an outside source \u2014 such as a city \u2014 the clean water coming in can become contaminated if it passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because the EPA doesn\u2019t generally require this water to be tested and regulated, the problems may go unseen.",
      "Utah is one of the few states to step in with their own rules, according to an AP survey of state policies.",
      "\u201cIf you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the \u201970s when they were starting, it was, \u2018Well, as long as the source \u2026 is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "In one Colorado mobile home park, raw sewage backed up into a bathtub. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee \u2014 scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. In California, boxes of bottled water crowd a family's kitchen over fears of arsenic.",
      "Almost 17 million people in the U.S. live in mobile homes. Some are comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes and see mobile homes as a rare opportunity for home ownership.",
      "To understand how water in the parks can be so troubled, it\u2019s useful to remember that residents often own their homes but rent the land they sit on. Despite the name, it's difficult and expensive to move a mobile home. That means they\u2019re \u201chalfway homeowners,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Residents often put up with \u201creally egregious\u201d property maintenance by landlords because all their money is tied up in their home, she said.",
      "Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. By then, she had spent eight years in a park where sewage backed up into homes and the flow of tap water was sometimes weak or discolored.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn\u2019t get in my mouth because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI went to brush my teeth, and I just turned the faucet on and I brushed my teeth from the water coming from the faucet. I haven\u2019t been able to do that for over a year.\u201d",
      "Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The park's owner says a licensed professional ensures water is maintained and tested, and outages are minimized.",
      "The U.S. has some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns and rural areas. Many struggle to find expert staff and funding, and they violate clean water rules more often than the handful of large utilities that serve cities. But even among the hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand out.",
      "The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. And they are far more likely to be repeat offenders of safe drinking water rules overall.",
      "But that's only part of the story. The true rates of mobile home park violations aren\u2019t knowable because the EPA doesn\u2019t track them well. The agency\u2019s tap water violation database depends on information from states that often don\u2019t properly categorize mobile home parks.",
      "When Smith first searched Utah\u2019s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. With some keyword searches, he identified 33 more.",
      "Other parks aren\u2019t in the databases at all and may be completely unregulated.",

      "\u201cIt was literally us driving around and going, \u2018Wait a minute, there\u2019s a bunch of mobile home parks!\u2019\u201d said Amy Miller, who previously served as EPA\u2019s head of enforcement for the Pacific Southwest region.",
      "The water in these other parks had been off their radar. At some, testing found high levels of cancer-causing arsenic in the water that had been provided to residents for years.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many unnoticed parks are out there. Most states aren\u2019t actively looking for them and say they find very few. In Colorado, after the state passed a new law to require water testing at all mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source of water unknown. That\u2019s about a tenth of the total parks in the state.",
      "Many parks are decades old with aging pipes that can cause chronic water problems, even if the water that supplies the park is clean when it enters the system.",
      "Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to find the piping in the mobile home parks because if there\u2019s any kind of obstruction, they just go around it,\u201d he said. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti laying in the ground.\u201d",
      "After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that \u201cwere barely buried. Some of them weren\u2019t buried.\u201d",
      "When pipes break and leak, the pressure drops and contaminants can enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water \u2014 where pipes dead-end or water sits unused \u2014 that increases the risk of bacterial growth.",
      "Rebecca Sadosky is public water supply chief in North Carolina, where mobile home communities make up close to 40% of all water systems. She said owners don\u2019t always realize when they buy a park that they could also be running a mini utility.",
      "\u201cI think they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re getting into the water business,\u201d she said.",
      "Utah is a rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that get their water from another provider, according to AP\u2019s survey of states. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner.",
      "In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get clear answers.\u201d",
      "Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. And if those parks are regulated, what\u2019s to stop the rules from extending to the privately owned pipes in big apartment buildings \u2014 the line has to be drawn somewhere, he said.",
      "Via said residents of parks where an owner refuses to fix water problems have options, including going to their local health departments, suing or complaining publicly.",
      "Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado\u2019s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. It gives health officials the ability to go beyond federal law to address taste, color and smell that can make people afraid to drink their water, even when it\u2019s not a health risk. The state is now a leader in protecting mobile home park tap water.",
      "Smith, the Utah environmental scientist, said stopping the contaminated water flowing into the mobile home park and connecting it to a safe supply felt like a career highlight.",
      "He said Utah's culture of making do with scarce water contributed to a willingness for stronger testing and regulations than the federal government requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of the communal nature of like, everybody should have access to clean water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024 with less than 1.6 kids per woman, new federal data released Thursday shows.",
      "The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it has been sliding in America for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.",
      "The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.",
      "Alarmed by recent drops, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d that might encourage more couples to have kids.",
      "But there's no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this as part of an ongoing process of fertility delay. We know that the U.S. population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase \u2014 more births than deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the statistic for the total fertility rate with updated birth data for 2024.",
      "In the early 1960s, the U.S. total fertility rate was around 3.5, but plummeted to 1.7 by 1976 after the Baby Boom ended. It gradually rose to 2.1 in 2007 before falling again, aside from a 2014 uptick. The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",

      "The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for donation by some patients who showed signs of life",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday.",
      "While the organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized.",
      "\u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee and whose mother died waiting for a liver transplant.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,\u201d Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor.",
      "The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. That surgery never happened after a doctor noticed him moving and moaning while being transported to the operating room \u2014 and the man survived.",
      "Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately and save tens of thousands of lives a year. But the federal probe \u2013 concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing -- cited a \u201cconcerning pattern of risk\u201d in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs.",
      "The report said some should have been stopped or reassessed earlier, and mostly involved small or rural hospitals with less experience in caring for potential organ donors.",
      "The Kentucky organ procurement organization, or OPO, has made changes and the national transplant network is working on additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday was any testimony from hospitals \u2013 whose doctors must independently determine a patient is dead before donation groups are allowed to retrieve organs.",
      "Here's a look at how the nation's transplant system works.",

      "Hospitals are required to alert their area OPO to every potential donor who is declared brain-dead or once the decision to withdraw life support is made.

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For nearly 20 years, Maria would call her sister \u2014 a nurse in Mexico \u2014 for advice on how to manage her asthma and control her husband\u2019s diabetes instead of going to the doctor in California.",
      "She didn\u2019t have legal status, so she couldn\u2019t get health insurance and skipped routine exams, relying instead on home remedies and, at times, getting inhalers from Mexico. She insisted on using only her first name for fear of deportation.",
      "Things changed for Maria and many others in recent years when a handful of Democrat-led states opened up their health insurance programs to low-income immigrants regardless of their legal status. Maria and her husband signed up the day the program began last year.",
      "\u201cIt changed immensely, like from Earth to the heavens,\u201d Maria said in Spanish of Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program. \u201cHaving the peace of mind of getting insurance leads me to getting sick less.\u201d",
      "At least seven states and the District of Columbia have offered coverage for immigrants since mostly 2020. But three of them have done an about-face, ending or limiting coverage for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who aren\u2019t in the U.S. legally in California, Illinois and Minnesota.",
      "The programs cost way more than officials had projected at a time when the states are facing multibillion-dollar deficits now and in the future. In Illinois, adult immigrants ages 42-64 without legal status have lost their health care to save an estimated $404 million. All adult immigrants in Minnesota no longer have access to the state program, saving nearly $57 million. In California, no one will automatically lose coverage, but new enrollments for adults will stop in 2026 to save more than $3 billion over several years.",

      "Health care providers told The Associated Press that everything, especially the fear of being arrested or deported, is having a chilling effect on people seeking care. And states may have to spend more money down the road because immigrants will avoid preventive health care and end up needing to go to safety-net hospitals.",
      "\u201cI feel like they continue to squeeze you more and more to the point where you\u2019ll burst,\u201d Maria said, referencing all the uncertainties for people who are in the U.S. without legal permission.",

      "CommunityHealth is one of the nation\u2019s largest free clinics, serving many uninsured and underinsured immigrants in the Chicago area who have no other options for treatment. That includes the people who lost coverage July 1 when Illinois ended its Health Benefits for Immigrants Adults Program, which served about 31,500 people ages 42-64.",
      "One of CommunityHealth\u2019s community outreach workers and care coordinator said Eastern European patients she works with started coming in with questions about what the change meant for them. She said many of the patients also don\u2019t speak English and don\u2019t have transportation to get to clinics that can treat them. The worker spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Health Finders Collective in Minnesota's rural Rice and Steele counties south of Minneapolis serves low-income and underinsured patients, including large populations of Latino immigrants and Somali refugees. Executive director Charlie Mandile said they\u2019re seeing patients rushing to squeeze in appointments and procedures before 19,000 people age 18 and older are kicked off of insurance at the end of the year.",
      "Free and community health clinics in all three states say they will keep serving patients regardless of insurance coverage \u2014 but that might get harder after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services decided this month to restrict federally qualified health centers from treating people without legal status.",

Democratic state leaders last month agreed to stop new enrollment starting in 2026 for all low-income adults without legal status. Those under 60 remaining on the program will have to pay a $30 monthly fee in 2027.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will recognize Palestine as a state, amid snowballing global anger over people starving in Gaza",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Thursday that France will recognize Palestine as a state, in a bold diplomatic move amid snowballing global anger over people starving in Gaza. Israel denounced the decision.",
      "Macron said in a post on X that he will formalize the decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September. \u201cThe urgent thing today is that the war in Gaza stops and the civilian population is saved,'' he wrote.",
      "The mostly symbolic move puts added diplomatic pressure on Israel as the war and humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip rage. France is now the biggest Western power to recognize Palestine, and the move could pave the way for other countries to do the same. More than 140 countries recognize a Palestinian state, including more than a dozen in Europe.",
      "The Palestinians seek an independent state in the occupied West Bank, annexed east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories Israel occupied in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel\u2019s government and most of its political class have long been opposed to Palestinian statehood and now say that it would reward militants after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack.",
      "\u2018\u2019We strongly condemn President Macron\u2019s decision,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. \u2018\u2019Such a move rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became. A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel \u2014 not to live in peace beside it.''",
      "The Palestinian Authority welcomed it. A letter announcing the move was presented Thursday to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Jerusalem.",
      "\u2018\u2019We express our thanks and appreciation'' to Macron, Hussein Al Sheikh, the PLO's vice president under Abbas, posted. \u2018\u2019This position reflects France\u2019s commitment to international law and its support for the Palestinian people\u2019s rights to self-determination.''",
      "The United States \u201cstrongly rejects\" Macron's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in a post on the social platform X.",
      "\"This reckless decision only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace. It is a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th,\" Rubio said.",
      "With Europe\u2019s largest Jewish population and the largest Muslim population in western Europe, France has often seen fighting in the Middle East spill over into protests or other tensions at home.",

    "story": [
      "France's highest court is ruling on whether it can strip Bashar al-Assad, the former Syrian leader now in exile in Russia, of his immunity as a head of state",
      "BRUSSELS -- France's highest court is ruling Friday on whether it can strip the head of state immunity of Bashar Assad, the former leader of Syria now in exile in Russia, because of the brutality of the evidence in accusations against him collected by Syrian activists and European prosecutors.",
      "If the judges at the Cour de Cassation lift Assad's immunity, it could pave the way for his trial in absentia over the use of chemical weapons in Ghouta in 2013 and Douma in 2018, and set a precedent to allow the prosecution of other government leaders linked to atrocities, human rights activists and lawyers say.",
      "Assad has retained no lawyers for these charges and has denied he was behind the chemical attacks.",
      "A ruling against Assad would be \u201ca huge victory for the victims,\u201d said Mazen Darwish, president of the Syrian Center for Media which collected evidence of war crimes. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about Syrians, this will open the door for the victims from any country and this will be the first time that a domestic investigative judge has the right to issue an arrest warrant for a president during his rule.\u201d",
      "He said the ruling could enable his group to legally go after regime members, like launching a money laundering case against former Syrian Central Bank governor and Minister of Economy Adib Mayaleh, whose lawyers have argued he had immunity under international law.",
      "For over 50 years, Syria was ruled by Hafez Assad and then his son Bashar. During the Arab Spring, rebellion broke out against their tyrannical rule in 2011 across the country of 23 million, igniting a brutal 13-year civil war that killed more than half a million people, according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights. Millions more fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Europe. The Assad dynasty manipulated sectarian tensions to stay in power, a legacy driving renewed violence in Syria against minority groups despite promises that the country\u2019s new leaders will carve out a political future for Syria that includes and represents all its communities.",
      "The ruling stripping Assad's immunity could set a \u201csignificant precedent\u201d that \u201ccould really set the stage for potentially for other cases in national jurisdictions that strike down immunities,\" said Mariana Pena, a human rights lawyer at the Open Society Justice Initiative, which helped bring the case to court.",
      "As the International Criminal Court has issued arrests warrants for leaders accused of atrocities \u2014 like Vladimir Putin in Ukraine, Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza, and Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines \u2014 the French judges\u2019 ruling could empower the legal framework to prosecute not just deposed and exiled leaders but those currently in power.",
      "The Syrian government denied in 2013 that it was behind the Ghouta attack, an accusation the opposition rejected as Assad\u2019s forces were the only side in the brutal civil war to possess sarin. The United States subsequently threatened military retaliation, but Washington settled for a deal with Moscow for Assad to give up his chemical weapons\u2019 stockpile.",
      "Assad survived more than a decade longer, aided militarily by Russia and Iranian-backed proxies. Activists and human rights group accuse him of using barrel bombs, torture, and massacres to crush opponents. But then in late 2024, a surprise assault by rebels swept into Aleppo and then Damascus, driving the dictator to flee for his ally Russia on Dec. 8, 2024. While Darwish and others plan to press Interpol and Russia to extradite him, they know it is unlikely. But an arrest warrant issued by France could lay the groundwork for the former dictator\u2019s trial in absentia or potential arrest if he travels outside Russia.",
      "Any trial of Assad, whether in absentia or if he leaves Russia, would mean this evidence could then \u201cbe brought to light,\u201d Pena said, including an enormous trove of classified and secret evidence amassed by the judges during their investigations.",
      "Syrians often took great personal risk to gather evidence of war crimes. Darwish said that in the aftermath of a chlorine gas attack in Douma, for example, teams collected eyewitness testimonies, images of devastation, and soil samples. Others then tracked down and interviewed defectors to build a \u201cchain of command\u201d for the regime\u2019s chemical weapons production and use.",

      "She said that kind of immunity is \"almost a taboo\" regardless of the weight of the charges. \"You have to wait until the person is not a sitting in office to be able to prosecute,\u201d she said.",

      "Uruguay\u2019s iconic palm trees are under attack by the invasive red palm weevil, a pest from Southeast Asia",
      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- Palm trees in Uruguay are more than just plants, they are icons, much like olive groves for Greeks or cherry blossoms for the Japanese.",
      "The treasured trees lining one of the world\u2019s longest sidewalks through Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital, and adorn the swanky Atlantic beach resorts of Punta del Este have recently come under ruthless attack.",
      "Across the small South American country, palm trees are falling prey to a fierce enemy measuring just 5 centimetres (2 inches) in length: The red palm weevil.",
      "First the elegant fronds droop. Then the tell-tale holes appear in the trunk. Soon enough, the tree is tilting toward collapse.",
      "The weevil has devoured thousands of Uruguay\u2019s palm trees since its unexplained arrival from Southeast Asia in 2022. But authorities are only now waking up to the threat as the landscape of municipalities transforms and fears grow that the country's beloved palms could be wiped out.",
      "\u201cWe are late in addressing this,\u201d Estela Delgado, the national director of biodiversity at Uruguay's Ministry of Environment, acknowledged last month. \u201cBut we are doing so with great commitment and seriousness.\u201d",
      "The insect and its devastating impact can be found in 60 countries around the world but nowhere else in South America. Authorities first detected it in the town of Canelones, bordering Montevideo, where the insect killed more than 2,000 palm trees in less than a month.",
      "Weevils quietly wreak destruction by boring through the open scars of pruned palms and laying hundreds of eggs inside. When larvae hatch, they tunnel through trunks and eat up the trees\u2019 internal tissue. Death strikes within weeks.",
      "The Uruguayan government set up a task force to combat the plague in March. In May, Environment Minister Edgardo Ortu\u00f1o declared the fight against the red palm weevil \u201ca national priority.\"",
      "As of this year, the red bug has proliferated in eight of the country's 19 regions, including Montevideo. Half of the capital's 19,000 palm trees have been infected, estimates Gerardo Grinvald, director of pest control company Equitec, which helps authorities combat the bug.",
      "The insect first attacks decorative Canary palms, the tree in so many pictures of Uruguay\u2019s sunny landscape, before moving onto its date palms.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s an invisible pest,\u201d Grinvald said, explaining the challenge of identifying an infestation when it starts. As a result, landowners fail to isolate and quarantine their trees, fueling the weevil's crawl across the country.",
      "The Montevideo municipality this year earmarked $70,000 for chemical pesticide sprays and insecticide injections meant to kill bugs inside infested trunks, with the goal of saving some 850 trees in the city\u2019s prominent Parque Rod\u00f3, a scenic urban park along the coast.",
      "In the southeast corner of Uruguay, home to Punta del Este, a beachy, palm-fringed haven for jet-set elites from all over the world, authorities recently allocated $625,000 for efforts to dispose of infected trees and lure weevils away from affected areas with pheromone traps and other methods.",
      "\u201cWe are losing our palm trees,\u201d lamented Montevideo resident Rafael dos Santos as he walked his dog in Parque Rod\u00f3. \u201cThey are historic in Uruguay, and a part of us.\u201d",
      "As the weevil's march continues unabated, authorities now fear native trees of Uruguay's UNESCO biosphere reserve bordering Brazil will fall victim next, potentially facilitating the spread of the parasite across an unprepared continent.",

      "For six hours every day after school, Nahideh works in a cemetery, collecting water from a nearby shrine to sell to mourners visiting loved ones\u2019 graves",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- For six hours every day after school, Nahideh works in a cemetery, collecting water from a nearby shrine to sell to mourners visiting loved ones\u2019 graves. She dreams of becoming a doctor \u2014 but knows it is a futile dream.",
      "When the next school year starts, she will be enrolling in a madrassa, a religious school, to learn about the Quran and Islam \u2014 and little else.",
      "\u201cI prefer to go to school, but I can\u2019t, so I will go to a madrassa,\u201d she said, dark brown eyes peering out from beneath her tightly wrapped black headscarf. \u201cIf I could go to school then I could learn and become a doctor. But I can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "At the age of 13, Nahideh is in the last grade of primary school, the limit of education allowed for girls in Afghanistan. The country\u2019s Taliban government banned girls from secondary school and university three years ago \u2014 the only country in the world to do so. The ban is part of myriad restrictions on women and girls, dictating everything from what they can wear to where they can go and who they can go with.",
      "With no option for higher education, many girls and women are turning to madrassas instead.",
      "\u201cSince the schools are closed to girls, they see this as an opportunity,\u201d said Zahid-ur-Rehman Sahibi, director of the Tasnim Nasrat Islamic Sciences Educational Center in Kabul. \u201cSo, they come here to stay engaged in learning and studying religious sciences.\u201d",
      "The center\u2019s roughly 400 students range in ages from about 3 to 60, and 90% are female. They study the Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, and Arabic, the language of the Quran.",
      "Most Afghans, Sahibi noted, are religious. \u201cEven before the schools were closed, many used to attend madrassas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the closure of schools, the interest has increased significantly, because the doors of the madrassas remain open to them.\u201d",
      "No recent official figures are available on the number of girls enrolled in madrassas, but officials say the popularity of religious schools overall has been growing. Last September, Deputy Minister of Education Karamatullah Akhundzada said at least 1 million students had enrolled in madrassas over the past year alone, bringing the total to over 3 million.",
      "Sheltered from the heat of an early summer\u2019s day in a basement room at the Tasnim Nasrat center, Sahibi\u2019s students knelt at small plastic tables on the carpeted floor, their pencils tracing lines of Arabic script in their Qurans. All 10 young women wore black niqabs, the all-encompassing garment that includes a veil, leaving only the eyes visible.",
      "\u201cIt is very good for girls and women to study at a madrassa, because \u2026 the Quran is the word of Allah, and we are Muslims,\u201d said 25-year-old Faiza, who had enrolled at the center five months earlier. \u201cTherefore, it is our duty to know what is in the book that Allah has revealed to us, to understand its interpretation and translation.\u201d",
      "Given a choice, she would have studied medicine. While she knows that is now impossible, she still harbors hope that if she shows she is a pious student dedicated to her religion, she will be eventually allowed to. The medical profession is one of the very few still open to women in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWhen my family sees that I am learning Quranic sciences and that I am practicing all the teachings of the Quran in my life, and they are assured of this, they will definitely allow me to continue my studies,\u201d she said.",

Both should be learned simultaneously.\u201d",
      "The female secondary and higher education ban has been controversial in Afghanistan, even within the ranks of the Taliban itself. In a rare sign of open dissent, Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Abbas Stanikzai said in a public speech in January that there was no justification for denying education to girls and women.",
      "His remarks were reportedly not well tolerated by the Taliban leadership; Stanikzai is now officially on leave and is believed to have left the country. But they were a clear indication that many in Afghanistan recognize the long-term impact of denying education to girls.",
      "\u201cIf this ban persists until 2030, over four million girls will have been deprived of their right to education beyond primary school,\u201d UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement at the start of Afghanistan\u2019s new school year in March. \u201cThe consequences for these girls \u2014 and for Afghanistan \u2014 are catastrophic. The ban negatively impacts the health system, the economy, and the future of the nation.\u201d",

      "\u201cLearning the Holy Quran is the foundation of all other sciences, whether it\u2019s medicine, engineering, or other fields of knowledge,\u201d said Mullah Mohammed Jan Mukhtar, 35, who runs a boys\u2019 madrassa north of Kabul. \u201cIf someone first learns the Quran, they will then be able to learn these other sciences much better.\u201d",
      "His madrassa first opened five years ago with 35 students. Now it has 160 boys aged 5-21, half of whom are boarders. Beyond religious studies, it offers a limited number of other classes such as English and math. There is also an affiliated girls\u2019 madrassa, which currently has 90 students, he said.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, there should be more madrassas for women,\u201d said Mukhtar, who has been a mullah for 14 years. He stressed the importance of religious education for women. \u201cWhen they are aware of religious verdicts, they better understand the rights of their husbands, in-laws and other family members.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- They are France 's most dangerous drug kingpins, according to the country's justice minister \u2014 prison inmates so wealthy and powerful that even behind bars, they can continue to order assassinations, run narco-trafficking operations and launder money.",
      "Flexing his powers as minister in charge of the French penal system, G\u00e9rald Darmanin's solution to the problem is contentious. He is moving 100 inmates \u2014 men he describes as \u201cFrance\u2019s biggest criminals\u201d \u2014 into an austere maximum security penitentiary in the country's north that critics say has echoes of tough U.S. prisons.",
      "The move is also possibly vote-catching for Darmanin, who has joined a growing field of possible successors to President Emmanuel Macron after the next election, less than two years away.",
      "In the newly reinforced Vendin-le-Vieil prison, the selected inmates will be locked in individual cells for 23 hours on most days.",
      "Largely cut off from the world, Darmanin argues they will no longer be able to fuel drug-related violence, which has become a political issue ahead of the 2027 presidential election.",
      "\u201cWe are here to guarantee that they don't speak to the outside, that they don't continue their trafficking outside, that they don't corrupt prison officers, magistrates, police officers and gendarmes,\" Darmanin said on primetime evening television after the first 17 inmates were transferred this week to Vendin-le-Vieil from other, less secure facilities.",
      "France has had a long history of both notorious prisons (the Bastille) and prisoners \u2014 both real (Napoleon) and fictional (\"The Count of Monte Cristo\").",
      "Still, Vendin-le-Vieil's lock-up conditions are exceptional, similar to the ultra-secure \u201cSupermax\u201d prison in the United States and Italy\u2019s tough \u201ccarcere duro\u201d incarceration rules for Mafia members.",
      "Vendin-le-Vieil already houses some of France's most infamous prisoners \u2014 including Salah Abdeslam, lone survivor of a team of Islamic State extremists that terrorized Paris in 2015, killing 130 people in gun and bomb attacks.",
      "To make way for the specially selected 100 inmates \u2014 some already convicted, others in pre-trial detention \u2014 many other Vendin-le-Vieil inmates were moved out. The newcomers will be grouped together in the prison's new \u201cSection for Combatting Organized Crime,\u201d with reinforced security and regulations, and equipped with systems to block mobile phone signals and drones.",
      "Among those on the list for Vendin-le-Vieil is Mohamed Amra, nicknamed \u201cThe Fly,\" who staged an escape last year that killed two guards and then fled to Romania before he was captured and returned to France.",

Darmanin says this will prevent mobile phones and other contraband from being smuggled in. The new Vendin-le-Vieil inmates also won't have the rights accorded in other prisons of intimate time with partners and family members.",

      "Brazilian coffee farmers are facing tough times after the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports earlier this month",
      "PORCIUNCULA, Brazil -- Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Natal da Silva often tends to his modest coffee plantation in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state in the middle of the night, sacrificing sleep to fend off pests that could inflict harm on his precious crops.",
      "But anxiety has troubled his shut-eye even more in recent weeks, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement earlier this month of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods, which experts expect to drive down the price of coffee in Brazil.",
      "Da Silva sighed as he recounted his fears, sitting on the dry earth surrounded by his glossy green arabica coffee shrubs, in the small municipality of Porciuncula.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sad because we struggle so much. We spend years battling to get somewhere. And suddenly, everything starts falling apart, and we\u2019re going to lose everything,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cHow are we going to survive?\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff on Brazil is overtly political. In his public letter detailing the reasons for the hike, the U.S. president called the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, a \u201c witch hunt.\u201d Bolsonaro is accused of masterminding a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss to left-leaning President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The tariff has sparked ripples of fear in Brazil, particularly among sectors with deep ties to the American market such as beef, orange juice \u2014 and coffee. Minor coffee producers say the import tax will hit their margins and adds to the uncertainty already generated by an increasingly dry and unpredictable climate.",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s largest coffee producer, exports around 85% of its production. The United States is the country\u2019s top coffee buyer and represents around 16% of exports, according to Brazil\u2019s coffee exporters council Cecafe.",
      "The president of Cecafe\u2019s deliberative council, M\u00e1rcio Ferreira, told journalists last week that he thinks the U.S. will continue to import Brazilian coffee, even with the hefty tariff. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that neither the United States nor any other source can give up on Brazil, even if it\u2019s tariffed,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tariff will likely decrease Brazilian coffee\u2019s competitiveness in the U.S. and naturally reduce demand, said Leandro Gilio, a professor of global agribusiness at Insper business school in Sao Paulo.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can quickly redirect our coffee production to other markets,\u201d Gilio said. \u201cThis principally affects small producers, who have less financial power to make investments or support themselves in a period like this.\u201d",
      "Family farmers produce more than two-thirds of Brazilian coffee. They are a majority in Rio state\u2019s northwestern region, where most of the state\u2019s coffee production lies.",
      "Coffee farming is the primary economic activity in these municipalities. In Porciuncula, which neighbors Brazil\u2019s largest coffee-producing state Minas Gerais, gentle mountains are layered with symmetrical lines of coffee shrubs.",

      "Last year, drought \u2014 made more likely by human-caused climate change \u2014 devastated large swathes of da Silva's production. The reduction in supply pushed coffee prices up, but only after many small-scale farmers had already sold all their crops.",
      "Since peaking in February, prices of arabica have fallen, dropping 33% by July, according to the University of Sao Paulo\u2019s Center for Advanced Studies in Applied Economics, which provides renowned commodity price reports.",
      "\u201cWhen you make an investment, counting on a certain price for coffee, and then when you go to sell it the price is 20-30% less than you calculated, it breaks the producers,\u201d said Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, 31, who also owns a modest plantation of around 35,000 coffee trees in the nearby municipality of Varre-Sai.",

      "The European Central Bank probably isn't going to cut interest rates again on Thursday",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Central Bank will likely hold off on making another interest rate cut Thursday, choosing to wait until it can measure the size of any economic blow from higher U.S. tariffs.",
      "The ECB has already cut rates eight times since June of last year and President Christine Lagarde said after the last policy meeting June 5 that the central bank is \u201cgetting to the end of a monetary policy cycle.\" The monetary authority for the 20 countries that use the euro currency has been lowering rates to support growth after raising them in 2022-2023 to snuff out inflation caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the rebound after the pandemic.",
      "With the bench mark rate now at 2%, down from a record high of 4%, analyst think there could be one more rate cut coming, but only in September.",
      "The reason, say analysts: The ECB's policymakers simply don't know the outcome of talks between the EU's executive commission and the Trump administration. Trump first set a 20% tariff for EU goods, then threatened 50% after expressing displeasure at the pace of talks, then sent the EU a letter informing officials of a potential 30% tariff. EU officials earlier held out hope of winning at least the 10% baseline that applies to almost all trade partners, and analysts think that the actual rate may be lower than Trump's tariff threats. The talks are up against an Aug. 1 deadline, but earlier deadlines have slipped as the sides kept talking.",
      "The decision to hold rates unchanged will be \u201cuncontroversial\u201d among members of the bank's rate-setting council, said analysts at UniCredit's Investment Institute.",
      "\u201cIn light of recent events, the risk of an adverse tariff scenario has increased since the June ECB meeting. The 30% tariff on EU goods threatened by the US is much higher than generally expected,\u201d the UniCredit analysts wrote. \"However, the response of financial markets to US President Donald Trump\u2019s letter to the EU has been muted, and this seems to reflect expectations that the landing point for tariffs on EU goods will be materially below 30%.",

      "Growth in the eurozone was relatively strong at 0.6% in the first quarter - though that was partly due to rushed shipments of goods trying to beat the tariffs. Inflation has fallen from double digits in late 2022 to 2% in June, in line with the ECB's target. A stronger euro, which lowers the price of imports, and softer global prices for oil have helped keep inflation moderate.",
      "The stronger euro, up 13% this year at $1.17, has attracted attention as a potential damper on growth and ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said any rapid moves over $1.20 could be \u201cmuch more complicated.\u201d But the ECB typically does not target the exchange rate, and the euro's rise is considered to be less the result of Europe's strength and more the result of a weaker dollar weighed down by investor uncertainty about the future path of inflation, growth and government debt in the US.",

      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help",
      "NEW YORK -- After five years of working long nights as a truck driver, Julius Mosley wanted a change. He found driving unfulfilling, and his teenage son needed him to spend more time at home.",
      "So Mosley took a job as a customer service representative at a telecommunications company near his home. The employee benefits included being able to take job-related classes for free. He decided he wanted to study leadership so he could learn about managing teams and helping people become the best versions of themselves.",
      "His company, Spectrum, paid for a 10-week front-line manager certificate program that Mosley went on to complete. Then it covered the tuition cost for a bachelor's degree in leadership and organization studies that he's currently pursuing. The company also promoted him to a management position while he took college courses online.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely changed the course of my life,\u201d Mosley said about the education benefit, which took care of his tuition up front instead of requiring him to pay and seek later reimbursement. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a blessing to be able to do this.\u201d",
      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help defraying the expense of college and professional credentials. Nearly half of public and private employers have a tuition reimbursement program for employees, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, or SHRM.",
      "Many employers that provide tuition assistance reimburse staff members up to $5,250 per year because that amount is tax-deductible, said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute, which offers credentials to HR professionals.",
      "Some companies offer more, including Bank of America, which provides tuition assistance of up to $7,500 annually, and Spectrum which, in addition to its prepaid tuition program, reimburses employees earning master's degrees or enrolled in classes that fall outside the scope of its prepaid program up to $10,000 per year.",
      "\"For companies who are looking to attract Generation Z and Millennials, it\u2019s a great way to bring them in because they\u2019re keenly interested in how companies are investing in them and the benefits that are available,\" said Dufrane.",
      "Because many college graduates start jobs after accumulating student loan debt, about 8% of employers also offer help with student loan repayment, according to James Atkinson, vice president of thought leadership at SHRM.",
      "If continuing education feels out of reach financially or seems incompatible with job demands, experts say there are ways to explore the possibility, either by by making the case to your employer or seeking a position at a place that provides education benefits.",
      "In traditional tuition reimbursement programs, employees lay out thousands of dollars to pay for tuition, books and fees at the start of a semester, and usually must complete the course with a passing grade before a company would kick in its contribution.",
      "That means employees would often wait four to six months before being reimbursed, which only works for more affluent workers, said Paul Marchand, chief human resources officer at Spectrum.",
      "\u201cThe person that can afford to put it on their credit card and sit with $3- or $4- or $5,000 of expenses due back to them and not be concerned about that cost, that is not our average worker,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cOur average worker is making $25, $28, $30 bucks an hour, maybe having a second job, maybe a single parent with kids, ... and they\u2019re important workers for us, and we want to help develop them and grow their careers.\u201d",
      "Spectrum launched a program that lets employees sign up for an array of certificates or college courses while paying nothing themselves. The eligible courses and where to take them came from Guild, a Denver company that works with employers on workforce development and tuition assistance.",
      "Walmart offers a similar benefit to its front-line associates, who can enroll in college or certain classes without ever seeing an invoice, according to company spokesperson Jimmy Carter. The benefit also extends to family members of the employees, he said.",
      "As recent college graduates have struggled with debts from college, some employers have added student loan repayment programs as well as tuition assistance.",

After guitarist Bob Welch left the band, Fleetwood invited Buckingham to Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham insisting Nicks join too. The band also included the late Christine McVie on keyboards and John McVie on bass.",
      "Generations of avid Fleetwood Mac fans have tattooed their lyrics or analyzed them at a forensic level, enshrining the tumultuous relationship between Buckingham and Nicks in pop culture. The upcoming reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d is a reminder of the couple's musical beginnings and the special status their only joint album has held among fans and record collectors.",
      "\u201cAs soon as we put it out, it goes that day,\u201d said Michael Bell, owner of Hunky Dory Records, which has locations in Raleigh, Durham and Cary, North Carolina.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham met during high school at a local church in Northern California where young musicians gathered on a school night, according to Stephen Davis' \u201cGold Dust Woman: The Biography of Stevie Nicks.\u201d",
      "Buckingham played the Mamas & the Papas' \u201cCalifornia Dreamin'\" on piano, prompting Nicks to chime in, singing Michelle Phillips\u2019 high harmony.",
      "\u201cThey glanced at each other; she noticed his eyes, cold blue like lake ice,\" Davis wrote. \"They sang the whole song while the room went quiet, everyone mesmerized.\u201d",
      "After high school, Nicks joined the band Buckingham was in, Fritz, which would open for Creedence Clearwater Revival, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. They eventually split off as a duo, started dating and moved to Los Angeles.",
      "Nicks said she loved Buckingham before he was a millionaire, according to Davis' book, and \u201cwashed his jeans and embroidered stupid moons and stars on the bottom of them.\u201d",
      "The first track on \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d \u201cCrying in the Night,\" has \u201ca sense of Joni Mitchell fronting the Eagles,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cFrozen Love\u201d closed out side two, with \u201clayers of strings and synthesizers and a major Lindsey Buckingham rock guitar symphony.\"",
      "\u201cNo one seemed to like the record,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cPolydor executives hadn\u2019t even wanted to release it.\"",
      "A review that ran in The Pittsburgh Press said Nicks and Buckingham produced \"a pleasant, albeit a whiny vocal blend on some pretty fair songs.\u201d",

      "The problem: Mortgages signed by the Paxtons contained inaccurate statements declaring that each of those three houses was their primary residence, enabling the now-estranged couple to improperly lock in low interest rates, according to an Associated Press review of public records. The lower rates will save the Paxtons tens of thousands of dollars in payments over the life of the loan, legal experts say.",
      "The records also revealed that the Paxtons collected an impermissible homestead tax break on two of those homes, and they have routinely flouted lending agreements on some of their other properties.",
      "It is a federal and state crime to knowingly make false statements on mortgage documents. It's also against the law in Texas to collect a homestead tax break on two separate properties. Violating the terms of a mortgage could allow lenders recourse to seek full payment of a loan, according to legal experts.",

      "In a statement, Marisol Samayoa, a Schiff spokeswoman, blasted the criminal referral as \u201ca transparent attempt\u201d by Trump \u201cto punish a perceived political foe who is committed to holding him to account.\u201d She added that Schiff disclosed to his lenders that he owned another home that was a principal residence and sought guidance from an attorney.",
      "It is unlikely that Paxton, a staunch Trump ally, will face the same federal scrutiny as James and Schiff. It\u2019s equally doubtful that Paxton will face much legal trouble in Texas: His office is one of the primary agencies tasked with investigating allegations of mortgage fraud.",

      "The tax break was worth several thousand dollars, a fact that confounded real estate lawyers. \u201cWhy would you try to do all of this,\u201d Lawji said, \u201cwhen you are the attorney general? That\u2019s a bigger question to me than the money, when you are AG and have to enforce this law.\u201d",
      "Separately, land records indicate the Paxtons may have violated the terms of at least two mortgages on other houses they own. The mortgage on a home in College Station, Texas, says the property is for the Paxtons\u2019 exclusive use and cannot be rented out. Doing so would be grounds for terminating the mortgage, the document states. The home has been listed for rent on real estate websites on-and-off since at least 2022.",
      "Ken Paxton also holds a $1.2 million mortgage on a \u201c5 bedroom luxury cabin\u201d in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, that is for rent on Airbnb and other short-term rental sites, records show. The property\u2019s mortgage stipulates that it cannot be rented out.",
      "Representatives for Stifel Bank, Cornerstone Home Lending and Benchmark Mortgage, which issued the mortgages in question, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Paxton\u2019s real estate dealings are in many ways distinct from those of James and Schiff, the Democrats targeted by the Trump administration.",
      "The investigation of James centers on forms she signed in 2023 while helping a niece buy a home in Virginia. One form stated that James intended to occupy the home as her \u201cprincipal residence.\u201d But in other documents, the New York attorney general made clear she had no intention of living there. An email to the mortgage loan broker two weeks before she signed the documents stated the property \u201cWILL NOT be my primary residence.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve said from the beginning, if prosecutors want to know that truth about Attorney General James\u2019 mortgage applications, we are ready and waiting with the facts,\u201d said Lowell, James\u2019 attorney.",
      "For over a decade, Schiff owned homes in Maryland and California, the state he represents, that were both designated as his primary residence. In 2020, then a congressman, Schiff designated his Maryland property as a second home \u2014 a step Paxton has not taken.",
      "Paxton\u2019s real estate dealings are not the first time he has drawn scrutiny for his conduct while in office.",
      "Before his election as attorney general, Paxton, then a state senator, admitted in 2014 to violating Texas securities law and paid a fine.",
      "He spent roughly 10 years under state indictment on securities charges while serving as attorney general. The charges were eventually dropped in 2024. Other alleged misdeeds in office led to his impeachment by Texas\u2019 GOP-controlled House in 2023. He was acquitted in a trial by the Senate.",
      "Angela Paxton did not cast a vote in his impeachment trial and recently filed for divorce, citing Ken Paxton\u2019s infidelity and other \u201crecent discoveries.\u201d She did not elaborate.",
      "What ultimately unleashed the impeachment push was Paxton\u2019s relationship with Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, who pleaded guilty this year to one count of making a false statement to a financial institution.",
      "In 2020, eight top aides in Paxton\u2019s office told the FBI they were concerned the state\u2019s top law enforcement official was misusing his office to help Paul over the developer\u2019s unproven claims about an elaborate conspiracy to steal $200 million of his properties.",
      "The House impeachment managers accused Paxton of attempting to interfere in foreclosure lawsuits and issuing legal opinions to benefit Paul. They also alleged that Paul employed a woman with whom Paxton had an affair in exchange for legal help and that the developer paid for expensive renovations to the attorney general\u2019s home in Austin.",
      "That would be the same house that he declared in mortgage documents was his third primary residence.",

    "story": [
      "Brazilian coffee farmers are facing tough times after the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports earlier this month",
      "PORCIUNCULA, Brazil -- Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Natal da Silva often tends to his modest coffee plantation in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state in the middle of the night, sacrificing sleep to fend off pests that could inflict harm on his precious crops.",
      "But anxiety has troubled his shut-eye even more in recent weeks, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement earlier this month of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods, which experts expect to drive down the price of coffee in Brazil.",
      "Da Silva sighed as he recounted his fears, sitting on the dry earth surrounded by his glossy green arabica coffee shrubs, in the small municipality of Porciuncula.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sad because we struggle so much. We spend years battling to get somewhere. And suddenly, everything starts falling apart, and we\u2019re going to lose everything,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cHow are we going to survive?\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff on Brazil is overtly political. In his public letter detailing the reasons for the hike, the U.S. president called the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, a \u201c witch hunt.\u201d Bolsonaro is accused of masterminding a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss to left-leaning President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The tariff has sparked ripples of fear in Brazil, particularly among sectors with deep ties to the American market such as beef, orange juice \u2014 and coffee. Minor coffee producers say the import tax will hit their margins and adds to the uncertainty already generated by an increasingly dry and unpredictable climate.",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s largest coffee producer, exports around 85% of its production. The United States is the country\u2019s top coffee buyer and represents around 16% of exports, according to Brazil\u2019s coffee exporters council Cecafe.",
      "The president of Cecafe\u2019s deliberative council, M\u00e1rcio Ferreira, told journalists last week that he thinks the U.S. will continue to import Brazilian coffee, even with the hefty tariff. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that neither the United States nor any other source can give up on Brazil, even if it\u2019s tariffed,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tariff will likely decrease Brazilian coffee\u2019s competitiveness in the U.S. and naturally reduce demand, said Leandro Gilio, a professor of global agribusiness at Insper business school in Sao Paulo.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can quickly redirect our coffee production to other markets,\u201d Gilio said. \u201cThis principally affects small producers, who have less financial power to make investments or support themselves in a period like this.\u201d",
      "Family farmers produce more than two-thirds of Brazilian coffee. They are a majority in Rio state\u2019s northwestern region, where most of the state\u2019s coffee production lies.",
      "Coffee farming is the primary economic activity in these municipalities. In Porciuncula, which neighbors Brazil\u2019s largest coffee-producing state Minas Gerais, gentle mountains are layered with symmetrical lines of coffee shrubs.",

      "Besides coffee, he grows cassava, squash, bananas, oranges and lemons and has a few chickens that provide fresh eggs. \u201cWe have them because of the fear of not being able to eat. We wouldn\u2019t manage if everything were bought, because the profit is very low,\u201d he said.",
      "Last year, drought \u2014 made more likely by human-caused climate change \u2014 devastated large swathes of da Silva's production. The reduction in supply pushed coffee prices up, but only after many small-scale farmers had already sold all their crops.",
      "Since peaking in February, prices of arabica have fallen, dropping 33% by July, according to the University of Sao Paulo\u2019s Center for Advanced Studies in Applied Economics, which provides renowned commodity price reports.",
      "\u201cWhen you make an investment, counting on a certain price for coffee, and then when you go to sell it the price is 20-30% less than you calculated, it breaks the producers,\u201d said Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, 31, who also owns a modest plantation of around 35,000 coffee trees in the nearby municipality of Varre-Sai.",
      "Life out in the fields is tough, according to Menezes Freitas.",
      "During harvest season, he sometimes gets up at 3 a.m. to turn on a coffee drier, going to bed as late as midnight. The rest of the year is less intense, but still, there are few to no breaks because there\u2019s always work to do, he said.",
      "Menezes Freitas, who is expecting his first child in October, said the tariff\u2019s announcement increased his fears for the future.",

      "In addition to slashing the value of his coffee beans, Menezes Freitas said the tariff will impact machinery and aluminum \u2014 goods that producers like him use every day.",
      "\u201cWe hope this calms down. Hopefully, they\u2019ll come to their senses and remove that tariff. I think it would be better for both the United States and Brazil,\u201d he said.",

Trump first set a 20% tariff for EU goods, then threatened 50% after expressing displeasure at the pace of talks, then sent the EU a letter informing officials of a potential 30% tariff. EU officials earlier held out hope of winning at least the 10% baseline that applies to almost all trade partners, and analysts think that the actual rate may be lower than Trump's tariff threats. The talks are up against an Aug. 1 deadline, but earlier deadlines have slipped as the sides kept talking.",

      "As a small, export-oriented economy with major automobile, pharmaceutical and wine industries \u2014 some of the main categories of products Europe exports to the U.S. \u2014 Hungary will be particularly vulnerable to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The duties \u201cwould put the Hungarian economy in a very, very difficult situation, because then the entire possibility for Hungary to export to America would be essentially eliminated,\u201d P\u00e9ter Virov\u00e1cz, chief analyst at ING Hungary, told The Associated Press.",
      "Hungary\u2019s largest trading partners are other EU countries like Germany, Italy and Romania, as well as China, but many Hungarian companies export their goods across the Atlantic. Outgoing trade to the United States represents around 15% of all Hungarian exports to countries outside the EU.",
      "One such enterprise, a Budapest-based company specializing in Hungarian wine, said it will likely cease doing business in the U.S. altogether if the 30% duty is levied on its products.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s really going to be 30%, then there is no more shipment ... We might just call it a day at the end of the year,\u201d said G\u00e1bor B\u00e1nfalvi, co-owner of Taste Hungary.",
      "B\u00e1nfalvi\u2019s company has been shipping around 10,000 bottles of premium Hungarian wine per year to the U.S. for about half a decade. With a base in Washington D.C., it exports a range of red and white wines to clients in numerous U.S. states including specialty wine shops and bars.",
      "Until now, \u201cit\u2019s been a thin profit margin, but it\u2019s been fine because we want Hungarian wine to be available\u201d to U.S. consumers, B\u00e1nfalvi said.",
      "\u201cThen came 2025,\" he said.",
      "When Trump began imposing tariffs on EU exports earlier this year, the cost of Taste Hungary\u2019s shipments tripled, B\u00e1nfalvi said \u2014 price hikes he had to build into the sticker price of the wine. The imposition of 30% tariffs would make exporting \u201cunsustainable.\u201d",

      "But P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, director of the Budapest-based Political Capital think tank, expressed doubt that political affinities could play a meaningful role in mitigating damage to Hungary\u2019s economy caused by Trump\u2019s trade policy.",
      "\u201cThe unquestionably good bilateral relations simply cannot compensate for the trade conflicts between the EU and the U.S., and as a consequence, Hungary will suffer the tariffs the same way that the EU will,\u201d Krek\u00f3 said. \u201cMutual nationalisms cannot be coordinated in a way that it is going to be a win-win situation.\u201d",

      "Summer McIntosh is set to compete in five individual events at the world swimming championships in Singapore",
      "Summer McIntosh won three individual gold medals a year ago at the Olympics, the star in the Paris pool alongside France's L\u00e9on Marchand.",
      "Apparently unsatisfied with three, she'll go for five gold medals starting Sunday at the world swimming championships in Singapore. Call it a trial run for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.",
      "The worlds is the highest profile swim meet since last year's Olympics, a showcase for newcomers as well as veterans who hope to stick around until Los Angeles.",
      "McIntosh will be very busy during the eight days in the pool, packing her schedule with five individual events. She'll contend with prelims in some events, and she'll also add relays.",
      "\u201cThis means 14 or 15 races she could swim in eight days, demanding races,\u201d Canada's head coach Iain McDonald told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's a very challenging schedule she's set for herself.\u201d",
      "The 18-year-old Canadian set three world records in five days in June at the national trials. She broke her own 400-meter individual medley mark, dropping it to 4 minutes, 23.65 seconds, and set the 200 IM record (2:05.70) and the 400 freestyle record (3:54.18).",
      "She was also a mere half-second behind the 200 butterfly record, which has stood since 2009, and just off the 800 freestyle record set last month by American Katie Ledecky.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s such a versatile athlete, it\u2019s kind of tough to nail what her best events are,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty good right across the spectrum.\"",
      "McIntosh will be the focus on Day 1 of the pool events in Singapore. She swims the 400 freestyle final, and comes back about 30 minutes later for a semifinal of the 200 IM.",
      "Despite holding the world record in the 400 free, she's never won gold in the event at the Olympics or worlds. This time she's ready, and credits coach Fred Vergnoux.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m super pumped for the 400 freestyle and I\u2019m really excited to see how I manage doing the double,\u201d McIntosh told Canadian broadcaster the CBC.",
      "McIntosh said Vergnoux has boosted her endurance, pointing more to distance events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that I haven\u2019t been able to do it on world stage yet,\u201d she said of the 400. \u201cI think going into past big meets I haven\u2019t had the confidence in my training and my freestyle in general \u2014 technique-wise and endurance-wise \u2014 that I have now.\u201d",
      "Ariarne Titmus was the gold medalist in Paris with silver for McIntosh, but the Australian swimmer is taking a year off. It's Titmus's record that McIntosh just broke. Ledecky, the bronze medalist in Paris, appears to be McIntosh's chief rival.",

      "\u201cI think she loves it (the challenge),\u201d Greg Meehan, the U.S. team director, said of Ledecky. \u201cThere are always threats coming at you because you've set yourself to be the gold standard.\u201d",
      "McIntosh dominates the two IM races, and should also be a favorite in the 200 butterfly.",
      "Ledecky's best race is the 1,500 where she holds the world record and also has the 23 top times in history in the event \u2014 and No. 25, too. McIntosh is not in the field here.",
      "McIntosh, who will swim this fall under Bob Bowman at the University of Texas at Austin, arrived on the scene aged 14 at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, finishing fourth in the 400 free.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s been such a strong performer through her entire career at such a young age,\u201d McDonald said. \"But she always manages to surprise you, upping her game a little bit.\u201d",
      "Some of the attention in Singapore will be on 12-year-old Chinese swimmer Yu Zidi. Yu has qualified in the 200 and 400 IMs and the 200 butterfly and could face McIntosh in all three finals. Unbelievably, she could win a medal \u2014 at 12.",
      "Yu's time of 2:10.63 in the Chinese championships in May was the fastest by any 12 year old \u2014 female or male \u2014 in history. She's also swum 2:06.83 in the 200 fly and 4:35.53 in the 400 IM. Both of those times would have been good for fourth place in last year's Olympics.",
      "Astoundingly, Yu is 12 to 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at age 12, depending on the event. That's roughly a half-lap of a 50-meter pool.",
      "\u201cThere is always somebody coming up next,\u201d McDonald said.",

      "Like what the New York Giants did this offseason",
      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Like what the New York Giants did this offseason? Thank Malik Nabers.",
      "No, the wide receiver coming off an impressive rookie year didn\u2019t add co-general manager with Joe Schoen to his responsibilities. But Nabers did give coach Brian Daboll some input during a busy spring that included signing quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston, trading up to take Jaxson Dart late in the first round and also drafting running back Cam Skattebo.",
      "\u201cI think Dabes did a great job of asking me questions about making moves, and me and him were in contact about moves to be made,\u201d Nabers said. \u201cThat was a great job of him reaching out to the players about things that we were missing that we want.\u201d",
      "On defense, New York got a potential difference maker in edge rusher Abdul Carter with the third pick and filled some holes in the secondary in free agency by signing cornerback Paulson Adebo and safety Jevon Holland. Daboll mentioned Brian Burns and Dexter Lawrence among the other players he talks to about additions.",
      "Nabers did not have much to say for the other side of the ball. Offensively, where the Giants ranked third-worst in the league last season, he was happy to share his thoughts.",
      "\u201cHe was really telling me: \u2018How do you like this decision? How do you like this decision?\u2019\u201d Nabers said. \u201cHe was able to ask me questions like that because he knew I was going to give great feedback. Having that as a head coach to come to a rookie player to decide on what decisions to be made with the team next year, I feel like it shows the confidence that he has in me, the confidence that the organization has in me and I\u2019m hoping that we made some of the great decisions to be made.\u201d",
      "While Nabers turns 22 next week and is just one season into his professional career, having Daboll's ear did not happen by accident. The two started building a relationship at their first training camp together last year when Nabers wasn't shy about speaking up despite his lack of experience.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a smart player,\u201d Daboll said. \u201cI\u2019m close with him. And I think those relationships with all your players are important \u2014 and particularly ones that play like Malik.\u201d",
      "Nabers caught 109 passes for 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns \u2014 from four different quarterbacks \u2014 as a rookie. Only one (now fourth-stringer Tommy DeVito) is back, with Wilson opening as the starter, Dart waiting in the wings and Winston around as a reliable backup.",

      "All five players had pleaded not guilty to sexual assault in an encounter that took place in a London, Ontario, hotel room in the early hours of June 19, 2018. Years of speculation regarding the allegations \u2014 fueled by a lawsuit settlement, parliamentary hearings and revived investigations by the police and Hockey Canada, along with an NHL investigation \u2014 all preceded a complex trial earlier this year that included a mistrial and the dismissal of the jury, leaving the verdict to Carroccia.",
      "Carroccia explained her reasoning for the acquittals in detail over the course of about five hours, highlighting the complainant's \u201ctendency to blame others\u201d for inconsistencies in her allegations. She also said the woman went to \u201cgreat lengths\u201d to point out that she was really drunk through the course of the night, but that is not supported by surveillance video from a bar and hotel that night and the testimony of others.",
      "McLeod was also acquitted \u2014 and pleaded not guilty \u2014 on a separate count of being a party to the offense, an unusual application of a charge that is more typically seen in murder cases.",
      "The players, who are now between the ages of 25 and 27, were in London at the time for a gala and golf tournament marking their championship victory. They walked out of the courthouse surrounded by family members following the verdict.",
      "Their lawyers called the result a \u201cresounding vindication.\u201d",
      "Karen Bellehumeur, the woman's lawyer, told reporters outside the courthouse that her client was devastated.",

      "The woman testified in May that she was naked, drunk and scared when four of the men showed up unexpectedly in her room at the Delta Hotel London Armouries and felt the only \u201csafe\u201d option was to do what they wanted.

      "Archaeologists in central Israel are excavating one of the world's oldest known burial sites, dating back 100,000 years",
      "SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.",
      "The findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.",
      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "Tinshemet is exceptionally important to archaeologists because the local climate preserved the bones, tools, and ornaments in good condition, unlike many other parts of the world where these items were lost to time, said Christian Tryon, a professor at the University of Connecticut and a research associate at the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's sweeping new plan to counter China in achieving \u201cglobal dominance\u201d in AI promises to cut regulations and cement American values into the AI tools increasingly used at work and home.",
      "But one of Trump\u2019s three AI executive orders signed Wednesday \u2014 the one \u201cpreventing woke AI in the federal government\u201d \u2014 marks the first time the U.S. government has explicitly tried to shape the ideological behavior of AI.",
      "Several leading providers of the AI language models targeted by the order \u2014 products like Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot \u2014 have so far been silent on Trump's anti-woke directive, which still faces a study period before it gets into official procurement rules.",
      "While the tech industry has largely welcomed Trump's broader AI plans, the anti-woke order forces the industry to leap into a culture war battle \u2014 or try their best to quietly avoid it.",

      "Trump's order targets those \u201ctop-down\u201d efforts at tech companies to incorporate what it calls the \u201cdestructive\u201d ideology of diversity, equity and inclusion into AI models, including \u201cconcepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.\u201d",
      "The directive has invited comparison to China's heavier-handed efforts to ensure that generative AI tools reflect the core values of the ruling Communist Party. Secreto said the order resembles China\u2019s playbook in \u201cusing the power of the state to stamp out what it sees as disfavored viewpoints.\"",
      "The method is different, with China relying on direct regulation by auditing AI models, approving them before they are deployed and requiring them to filter out banned content such as the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989.",
      "Trump's order doesn't call for any such filters, relying on tech companies to instead show that their technology is ideologically neutral by disclosing some of the internal policies that guide the chatbots.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is taking a softer but still coercive route by using federal contracts as leverage,\u201d Secreto said. \u201cThat creates strong pressure for companies to self-censor in order to stay in the government\u2019s good graces and keep the money flowing.\u201d",
      "The order's call for \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI echoes the language of the president's one-time ally and adviser Elon Musk, who has made it the mission of the Grok chatbot made by his company xAI.",

      "The revered colorful weaving style associated with \u201cThe Tale of Genji\u201d of the 11th-century Heian era, has gone through its share of ups and downs. But its survival is more perilous than ever today, as demand for kimonos nose-dives among Japanese grappling with modernization.",

Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\u201cI would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that\u2019s wrecked,\u201d said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation.",

      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland\u2019s northern tip.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since the 15th century.",

      "Teenagers are turning to AI for advice, guidance and conversation",
      "As artificial intelligence technology becomes part of daily life, adolescents are turning to chatbots for advice, guidance and conversation. The appeal is clear: Chatbots are patient, never judgmental, supportive and always available.",
      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",
      "\u2014 Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that\u2019s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",
      "The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents.",
      "\u2014 Parents should watch for signs of unhealthy attachments.",
      "\u201cIf your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them \u2014 those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,\u201d Robb says.",
      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

      "While AI companions may feel supportive, children should understand the tools are not equipped to handle a real crisis or provide genuine mental health support. If kids are struggling with depression, anxiety, loneliness, an eating disorder or other mental health challenges, they need human support \u2014 whether it is family, friends or a mental health professional.",
      "\u2014 Get informed. The more parents know about AI, the better. \u201cI don't think people quite get what AI can do, how many teens are using it and why it's starting to get a little scary,\u201d says Prinstein, one of many experts calling for regulations to ensure safety guardrails for children. \u201cA lot of us throw our hands up and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know what this is!' This sounds crazy!' Unfortunately, that tells kids if you have a problem with this, don't come to me because I am going to diminish it and belittle it.\u201d",
      "Older teenagers have advice, too, for parents and kids. Banning AI tools is not a solution because the technology is becoming ubiquitous, says Ganesh Nair, 18.",
      "\u201cTrying not to use AI is like trying to not use social media today. It is too ingrained in everything we do,\u201d says Nair, who is trying to step back from using AI companions after seeing them affect real-life friendships in his high school. \u201cThe best way you can try to regulate it is to embrace being challenged.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that is difficult, AI can make easy. But that is a problem,\u201d says Nair. \u201cActively seek out challenges, whether academic or personal. If you fall for the idea that easier is better, then you are the most vulnerable to being absorbed into this newly artificial world.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is unveiling an \u201cAI Action Plan,\" shaped by Silicon Valley tech leaders who supported his campaign",
      "An artificial intelligence agenda that started coalescing on the podcasts of Silicon Valley billionaires is now being forged into U.S. policy as President Donald Trump leans on the ideas of the tech figures who backed his election campaign.",
      "Trump on Wednesday is planning to reveal an \u201cAI Action Plan\u201d he ordered after returning to the White House in January. He gave his tech advisers six months to come up with new AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden's signature AI guardrails on his first day in office.",
      "The unveiling is co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four tech investors and entrepreneurs who include Trump\u2019s AI czar, David Sacks.",
      "The plan and related executive orders are expected to include some familiar tech lobby pitches. That includes accelerating the sale of AI technology abroad and making it easier to construct the energy-hungry data center buildings that are needed to form and run AI products, according to a person briefed on Wednesday\u2019s event who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",

      "\u201cThe AI\u2019s incapable of giving you accurate answers because it\u2019s been so programmed with diversity and inclusion,\u201d Sacks said at the time. Google quickly fixed its tool, but the \u201cBlack George Washington\u201d moment remained a parable for the problem of AI's perceived political bias, taken up by X owner Elon Musk, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Vice President JD Vance and Republican lawmakers.",
      "The administration\u2019s latest push against \u201cwoke AI\u201d comes a week after the Pentagon announced new $200 million contracts with four leading AI companies, including Google, to address \u201ccritical national security challenges.\u201d",
      "Also receiving one of the contracts was Musk\u2019s xAI, which has been pitched as an alternative to \u201cwoke AI\u201d companies. The company has faced its own challenges: Earlier this month, xAI had to scramble to remove posts made by its Grok chatbot that made antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "Trump has paired AI's need for huge amounts of electricity with his own push to tap into U.S. energy sources, including gas, coal and nuclear.",
      "\u201cEverything we aspire to and hope for means the demand and supply of energy in America has to go up,\u201d said Michael Kratsios, the director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, in a video posted Tuesday.",

OpenAI announced this week that it has switched on the first phase of a massive data center complex in Abilene, Texas, part of an Oracle-backed project known as Stargate that Trump promoted earlier this year. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and xAI also have major projects underway.",
      "The tech industry has pushed for easier permitting rules to get their computing facilities connected to power, but the AI building boom has also contributed to spiking demand for fossil fuel production that will contribute to global warming.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday called on the world\u2019s major tech firms to power data centers completely with renewables by 2030.",
      "\u201cA typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cBy 2030, data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.\u201d",

      "Telzer\u2019s research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\u201cOne of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\u201d said Telzer. \u201cThey need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\u201d",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\u201cIf you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\u201d Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried that kids could get lost in this,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\u201d",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children\u2019s mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\u201cSocial media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\u201d Nair said. \u201cI think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the new addiction,\u201d Nair added. \u201cThat\u2019s how I see it.\u201d",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

      "Then there's the second ring of exposure \u2014 what happens after the video or photos spread.",
      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens",

      "But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century\u2019s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood\u2019s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world\u2019s most popular startups.",
      "The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time.",
      "The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast.",

Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.\u201d",
      "Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies.",

      "The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that\u2019s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.",
      "The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs \u2014 more than $123,000 on Monday \u2014 while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what\u2019s been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d for digital assets.",

      "As global temperatures rise under climate change, the bees responsible for pollinating many crops are under increasing stress and scientists are trying to understand how they are affected",
      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going out and getting more nectar. They\u2019re not mating. They\u2019re not doing the things that bees would otherwise do,\u201d McCluney said.",
      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",

      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new focus for biology,\" he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important, but it\u2019s not being studied a ton.\u201d",

      "Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would be more difficult in general for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses. Not being able to manage these pollinator deaths could cause the price of fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee and chocolate to jump or become scarce.",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",

McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",

A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",

      "It's the latest action by a top global tourist destination to push back against the infiltration of vacationers into residential neighborhoods and tourism overwhelming their communities. In May, Spain ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform for having violated rules. Last month, thousands of protesters in European cities like Barcelona and Venice, Italy, marched against the ills of overtourism.",
      "The Maui County Council's housing committee voted 6-3 to pass the bill, which would close a loophole that has allowed owners of condos in apartment zones to rent their units for days or weeks at a time instead of a minimum of 180 days. The mandate would take effect in the West Maui district that includes Lahaina in 2028. The rest of the county would have until 2030 to comply.",
      "The council still needs to vote on the bill, but the committee's result is a strong indication of the final outcome because all nine council members sit on the housing panel. The mayor is expected to sign the bill, which he proposed.",
      "\"Bill 9 is a critical first step in restoring our commitment to prioritize housing for local residents \u2014 and securing a future where our keiki can live, grow, and thrive in the place they call home,\u201d Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said in a statement, using the Hawaiian word for children.",
      "Vacation rentals currently account for 21% of all housing in the county, which has a population of about 165,000 people.",
      "An analysis by University of Hawaii economists predicted the measure would add 6,127 units to Maui\u2019s long-term housing stock, increasing supply by 13%.",
      "Opponents questioned whether local residents could afford the condos in question, noting that many of the buildings they are in are aging and their units come with high mortgages, insurance payments, maintenance and special assessment costs.",

      "The mayor told the council the bill was one part of a broader housing strategy that would include building new housing, investing in infrastructure and stopping illegally operated vacation rentals. He said there were limits to how much new housing could be built because of constraints on water supplies and sewer infrastructure.",
      "Tourism would continue on Maui but must do so in a way \u201cthat doesn't hollow out our neighborhoods,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "The mayor's staff told council members that visitor spending would decline with the measure but most of the drop would be on lodging. Because 94% of those who own vacation rentals in apartment zones don't live on Maui, they said much of this income already flows off-island. They predicted the county budget could withstand an estimated $61 million decline in annual tax revenue resulting from the measure.",

      "New federal data shows the fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024 with less than 1.6 kids per woman",
      "NEW YORK -- The fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024 with less than 1.6 kids per woman, new federal data released Thursday shows.",
      "The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it has been sliding in America for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.",
      "The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.",
      "Alarmed by recent drops, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d that might encourage more couples to have kids.",
      "But there's no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this as part of an ongoing process of fertility delay. We know that the U.S. population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase \u2014 more births than deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the statistic for the total fertility rate with updated birth data for 2024.",
      "In the early 1960s, the U.S. total fertility rate was around 3.5, but plummeted to 1.7 by 1976 after the Baby Boom ended. It gradually rose to 2.1 in 2007 before falling again, aside from a 2014 uptick. The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Birth rates are generally declining for women in most age groups \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t seem likely to change in the near future, said Karen Guzzo, director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina.",
      "People are marrying later and also worried about their ability to have the money, health insurance and other resources needed to raise children in a stable environment.",
      "\u201cWorry is not a good moment to have kids,\u201d and that\u2019s why birth rates in most age groups are not improving, she said.",

      "The CDC's new report, which is based on a more complete review of birth certificates than provisional data released earlier this year, also showed a 1% increase in births \u2014 about 33,000 more \u2014 last year compared to the prior year.",
      "That brought the yearly national total to just over 3.6 million babies born.",
      "But this is different: The provisional data indicated birth rate increases last year for women in their late 20s and 30s. However, the new report found birth rate declines for women in their 20s and early 30s, and no change for women in their late 30s.",
      "What happened? CDC officials said it was due to recalculations stemming from a change in the U.S. Census population estimates used to compute the birth rate.",
      "That's plausible, Root said. As the total population of women of childbearing age grew due to immigration, it offset small increases in births to women in those age groups, she said.",

      "The U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command has paused the use of a handgun following the death of a Security Forces airman at a base in Wyoming.",
      "The use of the M18 pistol, a variant of another gun that has been the target of lawsuits over unintentional discharge allegations, was paused Monday \u201cuntil further notice\u201d following the \u201ctragic incident\u201d on Sunday at the F.E.

      "Earlier this year, Sig Sauer appealed a ban of the P320, M17 and M18 pistols by the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission, arguing that it appears to be based on inaccurate and incomplete information.

Claims can still be filed over manufacturing defects. The law hasn't yet been incorporated into the case.",

      "A judge has scheduled sentencings in December for five former Memphis police officers convicted of federal charges in the beating death of Tyre Nichols",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A judge on Thursday scheduled sentencings in December for five former Memphis police officers convicted of federal charges in the 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols, after the sentencings were delayed when the previous judge in the case surprisingly recused himself.",
      "During a hearing, U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman said the five officers would be sentenced the week of Dec. 15. However, she noted those dates could change or be canceled depending on how she rules on several sealed motions, including one for a new trial for three of the men.",
      "Lipman said she could rule on the pending motions by mid-September.",
      "U.S. District Judge Mark Norris issued a terse order on June 13 saying he was recusing himself, just days before he was supposed to sentence the officers. He offered no further explanation, and the reason for his recusal has not been made public. Lipman was added to the case the same day.",
      "Norris later recused himself from a $550 million lawsuit filed by Nichols' mother against the city of Memphis, the police chief and the officers. Lipman also took over that case.",
      "Norris had overseen the case since federal indictments were issued in September 2023. He accepted guilty pleas from two of the officers and presided over the trial for the others in October.",
      "A flurry of motions were filed under seal after the recusal, including a request by defense attorneys seeking a new trial. It was not clear if any of those filings asked for Norris to step away from the case. It is unusual for a judge to recuse themself from a case between the trial and sentencing.",
      "The city of Memphis and its police chief, and the Daily Memphian news outlet, have filed motions to unseal the documents.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2023, the officers yanked Nichols from his car, then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who also are Black, caught up with him, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place just steps from his home.",
      "Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023.",
      "Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries \u2014 video that prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis.",

      "Bean, Haley and Smith were found guilty in federal court in October of obstruction of justice through witness tampering related to an attempt to cover up the beating.",
      "The officers failed to say that they or their colleagues punched and kicked Nichols and broke Memphis Police Department rules when they did not include complete and accurate statements about what type of force they used.",
      "Bean and Smith were acquitted of more serious civil rights charges by the federal jury. Haley was found guilty of violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs. He was also convicted of conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were acquitted in May of all state charges, including second-degree murder.",

Both Martin and Mills testified in the federal trial, and Mills also took the stand in the state trial.",

      "WAIANAE, Hawaii -- Hawaiian petroglyphs dating back at least a half-millennium are visible on Oahu for the first time in years, thanks to seasonal ocean swells that peel away sand covering a panel of more than two dozen images of mostly human-looking stick figures.",
      "The petroglyphs are easy to spot during low tide when gentle waves ebb and flow over slippery, neon-green algae growing on a stretch of sandstone. This is the first time the entire panel of petroglyphs are visible since they were first spotted nine years ago by two guests staying at a bayside U.S. Army recreation center in Waianae, about an hour\u2019s drive from Honolulu.",
      "Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner Glen Kila, who traces his lineage to the aboriginal families of this coastal Hawaii community, said he believes the resurfacing of the traditional marvels are his ancestors sending a message.",
      "\u201cIt's telling the community that the ocean is rising,\u201d said Kila, a recognized expert on the local culture and history of Waianae who is consulting with the Army on the protection of the petroglyphs.",
      "Army officials are trying to balance protecting the petroglyphs with their accessibility on a public beach.",
      "John and Sandy Stone consulted tide charts and drove about 30 minutes from their home early Tuesday to get a glimpse after a watching a local TV report about the petroglyphs.",
      "\u201cIt was so interesting to touch them,\u201d said John Stone, who splits his time between Hawaii and California. \u201cIt felt interesting to kind of have a connection with the past like that.\u201d",
      "It is difficult to date petroglyphs, but an archaeological site in the area is from about 600 years ago, said Laura Gilda, an archaeologist with U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii. According to Kila, Hawaiians arrived in Waianae at least 1,000 years ago.",
      "The beach here fluctuates in size and profile each year, with low-pressure weather systems that form in the eastern Pacific between May and November causing waves that cut away loose sand from shorelines and redeposit them further out, according to an Army report on the petroglyphs. That shift is likely what causes their temporary exposure.",
      "Archaeologists identified a total of 26 petroglyphs. Of the 18 anthropomorphic stick figures, eight are depicted with possible male genitalia and the remainder are of undetermined gender, the report said.",
      "The entire panel stretches about 115 feet (35 meters) long, Gilda said.",
      "When the petroglyphs first reemerged in July 2016, it was after late spring and early summer storms, including hurricanes, with a lot of wave action that swept the sand away, Gilda said.",

      "Based on the teachings Kila learned, the lineal petroglyphs appear to be telling a religious, ceremonial story. He interprets the largest figure, which appears to include hands and fingers with one arm raised and the other down, to represent the rising and setting sun.",
      "Kila said that when the military in the 1930s took over the area and evicted Native Hawaiians, including his family who lived there for generations, his great-great grandmother refused to leave so his family exchanged mountain lands with a coffee plantation so she could remain near the bay.",

      "A big bull moose has spent the summer lingering around a popular Adirondack mountain hiking trail, prompting New York state wildlife officials to close the path as they monitor the potentially ailing animal.",
      "The Goodman Mountain trail in the Horseshoe Lake Wild Forest has been temporarily closed since June 6 due to the oddly behaving animal. The moose is staying on or around the trail near the summit, sometimes sitting and sometimes foraging in a small area, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation.",

      "A baby born at only 21 weeks of gestation last July in Iowa City, Iowa, has just celebrated his first birthday, and among his gifts is a Guinness world record for most premature baby.",
      "Nash Keen was born on July 5, 2024 \u2014 133 days earlier than the expected due date and weighing only 10 ounces (283 grams) -- about the size of a bar of soap. He spent the next six months in the neonatal intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Health Care Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital before he was allowed in January to go home to Ankeny, Iowa, with parents Mollie and Randall Keen.",
      "\u201cNash is so full of personality. He\u2019s a happy baby,\u201d Mollie Keen said Wednesday, adding that he's slept through most nights since coming home from the NICU. \u201cBeing in the NICU as long as he was, you\u2019d think that he would be, you know, more fragile and stuff. And he\u2019s not. He\u2019s a very determined, curious little boy, and he\u2019s just all smiles all the time.\u201d",
      "Nash is among the growing number of extremely premature infants who are getting lifesaving treatment and surviving. Upon reaching his first birthday, Guinness World Records declared Nash the world's most premature baby, beating out by a single day the organization's previous record holder born in 2020 in Alabama.",
      "Nash's parents had already experienced the heartbreak of losing a baby when Mollie's first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. That's when she learned of a medical condition she had that might make it difficult for her to carry to full term.",
      "Mollie worried she and her husband might lose Nash, too, when she learned at her 20-week prenatal checkup that she was already 2 centimeters dilated. Doctors don't typically try to perform lifesaving measures for babies born before 22 weeks gestation as most born that young can't survive. But Mollie learned the neonatal team at Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital was performing lifesaving measures on babies born at 21 weeks gestation. She went into labor days before that benchmark, but with medical help, she was able to stall the birth to exactly 21 weeks.",
      "The next month was fraught with medical scares as an entire team of doctor's worked to keep Nash alive and thriving.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I noticed about the medical team is that they were very calm,\u201d she recalled. \u201cYou never really saw them, like, get anxious or anything. And so we kind of just learned to, like, watch them. And if, you know, if the doctors and the nurses weren\u2019t freaking out, there was no reason for us to freak out.\u201d",

Still, when consulting with the Keens before the birth, she didn't sugarcoat Nash's chances at survival or the likelihood that he would face serious medical complications if he did survive.",
      "\u201cUltimately, it is not me that lives with the outcomes of parents\u2019 decisions, so it is really important to me to have honest and open conversations with parents, so they feel fully informed to make the best decision for them and their family,\" Schaefer said.",
      "While Nash has experienced some complications and developmental delays common to those born extremely prematurely, his progress has been as good as medical science could hope for, his doctors say.",
      "At just over a year old, Nash remains on oxygen to help him breathe and is fed solely through a feeding tube, although he's preparing to try pureed foods. He also has a minor heart defect, which his doctors believe will resolve itself as he gets older.",
      "He's not yet crawling, but he is rolling over.",
      "\"He\u2019s learning how to stand on his two feet, which is awesome,\" his mom said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of strength in those legs.\u201d",

      "Ryan Routh previously made the request earlier this month during a hearing in Fort Pierce before U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon. She did not rule during the hearing but said she would issue a written order later. But now Routh, 59, is set to be back in front of Cannon, a day after his court-appointed federal public defenders asked to be taken off the case.",
      "Routh is scheduled to stand trial in September, a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted his attempt to shoot Trump as he played golf. Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "The judge told Routh earlier this month that she doesn\u2019t intend to delay the Sept. 8 start date of his trial, even if she lets him represent himself. Routh, who has described the extent of his education as two years of college after earning his GED certificate, told Cannon that he understood and would be ready.",
      "In a June 29 letter to Cannon, Routh said that he and his attorneys were \"a million miles apart\" and that they were refusing to answer his questions. He also suggested in the same letter that he could be used in a prisoner exchange with Iran, China, North Korea or Russia.",
      "\u201cI could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts; perhaps you have the power to trade me away,\u201d Routh wrote.",

      "Their goal is to make sure they are available in the future, believing that democracy suffers when policymakers don\u2019t have reliable data and that national statistics should be above partisan politics.",

And that gives me hope, even during these challenging times,\u201d Mary Jo Mitchell, director of government and public affairs for the research nonprofit the Population Association of America, said this week during an online public data-users conference.",
      "The threats to the U.S. data infrastructure since January have come not only from the disappearance or modification of data related to gender, sexual orientation, health, climate change and diversity, among other topics, but also from job cuts of workers and contractors who had been guardians of restricted-access data at statistical agencies, the data experts said.",
      "\u201cThere are trillions of bytes of data files, and I can't even imagine how many public dollars were spent to collect those data. ...

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The stench of trash and residue of bad decisions in one of America\u2019s favorite party hotspots is being scrubbed away, thanks to a change in garbage collectors that New Orleans residents say has transformed the French Quarter.",
      "\u201cThe Quarter has never been this clean,\u201d said Jill Wagner. She became inured during her three decades living along Bourbon Street to rat-infested, overflowing garbage cans and sidewalks stained with puke, urine and booze. Now, with a zesty lemon fragrance sprayed across the streets daily, \"it smells like Disney World.\u201d",
      "A chorus of residents and business owners is heaping praise on the city's so-called \u201cTrash King,\" Sidney Torres IV, and his company, IV Waste, for cracking the code to sanitary success.",
      "The district has gleamed since Torres was given an emergency year-long contract last December to handle its waste management, they say. Tourists stumbling out of a Bourbon Street bar around sunrise on any given day can find IV Waste employees power-washing sidewalks, scooping up cigarette butts and spritzing streets with his patented \u201clemon fresh\u201d cleaning formula.",
      "But a judge on Wednesday allowed Mayor LaToya Cantrell to replace IV Waste at the end of July, over the objections of the city council. With a local management district insisting on Torres, this raises the possibility of rival collectors competing for the French Quarter's garbage.",
      "\u201cJust because they like the other guy, that is not enough,\u201d the mayor's attorney Charles Rice told the judge, and he said there's \u201cno reason\u201d to believe a different contractor would do worse.",
      "A state appeals court is scheduled to review in August who will ultimately earn tens of millions of dollars managing the French Quarter's trash in 2026 and beyond.",
      "At stake is the attractiveness of some of the most important city blocks in the country, residents say \u2014 New Orleans reports that more than 19 million visitors spent a collective $10 billion last year, and most visited the historic French Quarter.",
      "In a city plagued by dysfunction including constant flooding, treacherous potholes and a massive jailbreak, Torres' company has become a point of civic pride. The quarter is filled with signs in support of IV Waste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not even in the same solar system -- the service they provide versus what others provide,\u201d said Danny Conwill, who owns an oyster bar off Bourbon Street and is suing the mayor to keep IV Waste. He recalls other trash collectors leaving \u201cnoxious garbage juices\u201d and heaps of shrimp heads and oyster shells scattered about, leading to rank summer odors bad for business.",
      "Torres, a real estate developer who began as a personal assistant to Lenny Kravitz and once hosted Justin Bieber's 20th birthday party at his Bahamas resort, became a local celebrity and reality TV star after launching a trash company to clean up the city after Hurricane Katrina. He then sold it and waited out a non-compete clause before rebuilding his trash empire with IV Waste.",

      "After a competitive bidding process last year, the city began negotiating a $73 million contract with another local firm, Henry Consulting, to clean the French Quarter for at least the next five years. But before the deal was finalized, council members grew alarmed that the company did not seem to have the necessary equipment or subcontracts in place as Super Bowl LIX and the annual Mardi Gras celebrations loomed.",
      "IV Waste then won an emergency contract to clean the French Quarter through 2025, and Henry Consulting sued, accusing the city of failing to uphold a valid contract.",
      "The metastasizing litigation now pits an outgoing mayor with waning popularity against a feisty city council and state officials including the attorney general, with both sides slinging accusations of cronyism. Cantrell was elected in 2017 with the endorsement of Henry Consulting founder Troy Henry.",
      "In April, Cantrell announced she was terminating the IV Waste contract early, and that Henry's firm would take over. This new no-bid contract would cost $2.1 million more, with inferior results, sanitation director Matt Torri told the city council on Monday. He and other officials said Henry Consulting still doesn't seem ready for the job.",
      "Henry Consulting declined to comment to The Associated Press. Cantrell's office told The AP that the city \u201cremains committed to working with all parties to provide sanitation services to the French Quarter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, a new Louisiana law empowers the management district to appoint its own garbage collector, and the residents and business owners who run this state agency selected IV Waste. Torres said his company will keep taking out the trash, even if it means rivals go toe-to-toe on Bourbon Street.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our job, and they can watch and learn,\" Torres said. \u201cThe French Quarter can rest assured that we\u2019re going to continue to clean.\u201d",

      "The United States and Mexico have signed an agreement outlining specific steps, funds and a timetable to clean up the longstanding problem of the Tijuana River pouring sewage across the border and polluting California beaches",
      "SAN DIEGO -- The United States and Mexico have signed an agreement outlining specific steps and a new timetable to clean up the longstanding problem of the Tijuana River pouring sewage across the border and polluting California beaches, officials from both countries announced Thursday.",
      "Billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana have polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water. That's despite multiple efforts and millions of dollars that have been poured into addressing the problem over decades, including under the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThere is a great commitment by the two countries to strengthen cooperation,\u201d Mexico\u2019s Environmental Secretary Alicia B\u00e1rcena said Thursday after meeting with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin in Mexico City for the signing of the memorandum of understanding.",
      "The accord comes three months after Zeldin flew to San Diego to meet with Mexican officials and visit the border.",
      "\u201cI smelled what a lot of residents in the community lived through and have to deal with,\" he said Thursday. \"I saw the degradation of the Tijuana River valley. I heard about the beaches that were closed. I met with the Navy Seals, who have had their training impacted. It was a powerful visit all around for me.\u201d",
      "Under the agreement, Mexico will complete its allocation of $93 million toward infrastructure projects, including adhering to a specific schedule for priority projects spanning through 2027.",
      "The 120-mile-long (195-kilometer) Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana\u2019s wastewater treatment plants have aged, its population and industry -- including the manufacturing plants, known as maquiladoras that make U.S. goods \u2014 have boomed. At the same time, there has been an increase in the amount of toxins that have made their way into the river and into San Diego County \u2014 since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who do not even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "\u201cThe communities along the Tijuana River have suffered this public health crisis for far too long,\u201d said Kristan Culbert, associate director of California river conservation at American Rivers, in a statement Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "Academics around the country are raising alarm about growing efforts to define antisemitism on terms pushed by the Trump administration",
      "NEW YORK -- For years, Marianne Hirsch, a prominent genocide scholar at Columbia University, has used Hannah Arendt\u2019s book about the trial of a Nazi war criminal, \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil,\u201d to spark discussion among her students about the Holocaust and its lingering traumas.",
      "But after Columbia\u2019s recent adoption of a new definition of antisemitism, which casts certain criticism of Israel as hate speech, Hirsch fears she may face official sanction for even mentioning the landmark text by Arendt, a philosopher who criticized Israel's founding.",
      "For the first time since she started teaching five decades ago, Hirsch, the daughter of two Holocaust survivors, is now thinking of leaving the classroom altogether.",
      "\u201cA university that treats criticism of Israel as antisemitic and threatens sanctions for those who disobey is no longer a place of open inquiry,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how I can teach about genocide in that environment.\u201d",
      "Hirsch is not alone. At universities across the country, academics have raised alarm about growing efforts to define antisemitism on terms pushed by the Trump administration, often under the threat of federal funding cuts.",
      "Promoted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, the definition lists 11 examples of antisemitic conduct, such as applying \u201cdouble standards\u201d to Israel, comparing the country\u2019s policies to Nazism or describing its existence as \u201ca racist endeavor.\u201d",
      "Ahead of a $220 million settlement with the Trump administration announced Wednesday, Columbia agreed to incorporate the IHRA definition and its examples into its disciplinary process. It has been endorsed in some form by Harvard, Yale and dozens of other universities.",
      "While supporters say the semantic shift is necessary to combat evolving forms of Jewish hate, civil liberties groups warn it will further suppress pro-Palestinian speech already under attack by President Donald Trump.",
      "For Hirsch, the restrictions on drawing comparisons to the Holocaust and questioning Israel\u2019s founding amount to \u201cclear censorship,\u201d which she fears will chill discussions in the classroom and open her and other faculty up to spurious lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWe learn by making analogies,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cNow the university is saying that\u2019s off-limits. How can you have a university course where ideas are not up for discussion or interpretation?\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Columbia didn\u2019t respond to an emailed request for comment.",
      "When he first drafted the IHRA definition of antisemitism two decades ago, Kenneth Stern said he \u201cnever imagined it would one day serve as a hate speech code.\u201d",
      "At the time, Stern was working as the lead antisemitism expert at the American Jewish Committee. The definition and its examples were meant to serve as a broad framework to help European countries track bias against Jews, he said.",
      "In recent years, Stern has spoken forcefully against what he sees as its \u201cweaponization\u201d against pro-Palestinian activists, including anti-Zionist Jews.",
      "\u201cPeople who believe they\u2019re combating hate are seduced by simple solutions to complicated issues,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when used in this context, it\u2019s really actually harming our ability to think about antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Stern said he delivered that warning to Columbia\u2019s leaders last fall after being invited to address them by Claire Shipman, then a co-chair of the board of trustees and the university\u2019s current interim president.",

But in March, shortly after the Trump administration said it would withhold $400 million in federal funding to Columbia over concerns about antisemitism, the university announced it would adopt the IHRA definition for \u201ctraining and educational\u201d purposes.",
      "Then last week, days before announcing a deal with the Trump administration to restore that funding, Shipman said the university would extend the IHRA definition for disciplinary purposes, deploying its examples when assessing \u201cdiscriminatory intent.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe formal incorporation of this definition will strengthen our response to and our community\u2019s understanding of modern antisemitism,\u201d Shipman wrote.",
      "Stern, who now serves as director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, called the move \u201cappalling,\" predicting it would spur a new wave of litigation against the university while further curtailing pro-Palestinian speech.",
      "Already, the university\u2019s disciplinary body has faced backlash for investigating students who criticized Israel in op-eds and other venues, often at the behest of pro-Israel groups.",
      "\u201cWith this new edict on IHRA, you\u2019re going to have more outside groups looking at what professors are teaching, what\u2019s in the syllabus, filing complaints and applying public pressure to get people fired,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will undoubtedly harm the university.\u201d",
      "Beyond adopting the IHRA definition, Columbia has also agreed to place its Middle East studies department under new supervision, overhaul its rules for protests and coordinate antisemitism trainings with groups like the Anti-Defamation League.",
      "Earlier this week, the university suspended or expelled nearly 80 students who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",
      "Kenneth Marcus, chair of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, said Columbia\u2019s actions were an overdue step to protect Jewish students from harassment.",
      "He dismissed faculty concerns about the IHRA definition, which he said would \u201cprovide clarity, transparency and standardization\u201d to the university\u2019s effort to root out antisemitism.",
      "\u201cThere are undoubtedly some Columbia professors who will feel they cannot continue teaching under the new regime,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cTo the extent that they self-terminate, it may be sad for them personally, but it may not be so bad for the students at Columbia University.\u201d",
      "But Hirsch, the Columbia professor, said she was committed to continuing her long-standing study of genocides and their aftermath.",
      "Part of that work, she said, will involve talking to students about Israel\u2019s \"ongoing ethnic cleansing and genocide\u201d in Gaza, where more than 58,000 Palestinians have died, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.",
      "\u201cWith this capitulation to Trump, it may now be impossible to do that inside Columbia,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll continue my work outside the university\u2019s gates.\u201d",

      "The argument was one of several in a filing Wednesday that seeks to overturn an order to deactivate Byron Black's implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, including when and where to do it. Black is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Aug. 5 at 10 a.m.",
      "His attorneys say his heart device would continuously shock him in an attempt to restore his heart\u2019s normal rhythm during the execution, but the state disputes that and argues that even if shocks were triggered, that Black wouldn't feel them.",
      "Officials said they would need to transfer Black through Nashville the morning of his execution to comply with a judge's order, and that the trip would create security risks, including from protestors. It's about 7 miles from Riverbend Maximum Security Institution to Nashville General Hospital.",

      "His cardioverter-defibrillator is a small, battery-powered electronic instrument that is surgically implanted in someone\u2019s chest, usually near the left collarbone. It can be deactivated with a handheld machine, but the state says Black\u2019s doctors have refused to come to the prison to do it.",
      "The state asked the judge to either overturn the order about the deactivation or allow the Tennessee Department of Correction to take Black to the hospital for it the day before his execution. After a hearing Tuesday, the judge adjusted his order to say the state needs to take Black to the hospital the morning of his execution rather than deactivating the device minutes before it.",
      "Henry told the judge the deactivation needs to happen immediately before the execution so authorities don't risk accidentally killing Black just before a possible reprieve.",

      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture will move thousands of employees out of the nation's capital in a reorganization the agency says will put them closer to customers while saving money, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Thursday.",
      "Around 2,600 workers \u2014 more than half the Washington, D.C. workforce \u2014 will be moved to five hubs stretching from North Carolina to Utah, Rollins said. The union representing federal workers immediately criticized the plan as a ploy to cut federal jobs, pointing out that some 95% of the department's employees already work outside Washington.",
      "The move is part of President Donald Trump's effort to make the federal government slimmer and more efficient, which received a Supreme Court boost this month.",
      "\u201cAmerican agriculture feeds, clothes, and fuels this nation and the world, and it is long past time the department better serve the great and patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers we are mandated to support,\u201d Rollins said in a statement.",
      "The goal is to re-size the department so that costs don't outstrip available finances, as well as eliminate layers of management and consolidate redundant functions, the statement said. The department expects the plan to take several months.",
      "The five hubs are in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Fort Collins, Colorado; Indianapolis and Salt Lake City.",
      "Although it\u2019s important to be closer to farmers and ranchers, Chad Hart, a professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University, said taking those employees out of Washington risks losing an important connection to Congress.",
      "\u201cYou want that balance\u201d to ensure effective farm policy, Hart said.",
      "Much of the government savings could come from employees who choose not to relocate, Hart said. He added that the agricultural community is concerned about a \u201cbumpy transition\u201d reminiscent of similar action during Trump\u2019s first term, when it took relocated Agriculture offices months to get up and running again.",
      "Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the labor union representing federal workers, had a sharper critique. He said about 85% of all federal employees already work outside the capital, but insisted Washington \u201cis the center of our nation\u2019s government for a reason.\"",
      "Workers at headquarters help coordinate between senior leaders and field offices, Kelley said, and they ensure the agency has a \u201cseat at the table\u201d when lawmakers and the White House make decisions that affect farmers nationwide.",

The statement from Rollins said the 4,600 employees in and around Washington are \u201cunderutilized and redundant\u201d and housed in underused buildings with billions of dollars in deferred maintenance.",
      "In the Washington region, the department will vacate three buildings and examine the best use of three others. One building set to be abandoned has $1.3 billion in needed but delayed maintenance and has room for 6,000 employees while only housing 1,900.",

      "One victim\u2019s aunt urged the killer to call her and answer her questions",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- One victim's aunt urged the killer to call her and answer her questions. Another's sister demanded to know her sibling's last words. Even the White House weighed in, saying President Donald Trump \u201cwould have forced this monster to publicly explain why he chose to steal these innocent souls.\u201d",
      "Instead, Bryan Kohberger is taking those details to prison with him after declining to make any statement as he was sentenced Wednesday for murdering four University of Idaho students in their rental home on Nov. 13, 2022.",
      "The plea deal that spared Kohberger's life required him to admit the elements of the crimes he committed, but it didn't force him to provide a narrative or say why he did it. That has raised questions about whether prosecutors could have or should have insisted on a full confession \u2014 including motive \u2014 as a condition of the deal.",
      "\u201cRarely does somebody in his situation give an accurate, true statement of what occurred,\u201d Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson said in an interview Thursday. \u201cWe would all like to know the details of what happened, but Mr. Kohberger is not going to be the source of getting the truth.\"",
      "Judge Steven Hippler sentenced Kohberger to four consecutive life terms for the brutal stabbing murders of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin \u2014 four students with whom he had no apparent connection. Hippler suggested in court that he too wanted to know why Kohberger did it, but he cautioned against continuing to wonder.",
      "\u201cBy continuing to focus on why, we continue to give Mr. Kohberger relevance, we give him agency and we give him power,\" the judge said. \"The need to know what is inherently not understandable makes us dependent upon the defendant to provide us with a reason, and that gives him the spotlight, the attention and the power he appears to crave.\u201d",
      "Plea deals typically require defendants to admit the elements of the offense and sometimes to provide a factual basis to support those elements. Prosecutors can also require defendants to provide testimony against co-defendants or give other cooperation.",
      "In some cases, they can require defendants to admit to crimes that couldn't otherwise be proved. Gary Ridgway, also known as the Green River Killer, who terrorized the Seattle area in the 1980s, had to give a full accounting of his criminal activities and lead investigators to previously undiscovered bodies before prosecutors took the death penalty off the table.",
      "Kohberger acknowledged he committed the \u201cwillful, unlawful, deliberate\u201d murder of the victims \"with premeditation and with malice aforethought\u201d as part of his agreement.",
      "But \u2014 whether in front of a jury or as part of a plea agreement \u2014 prosecutors don't have to prove motive to obtain a conviction.",
      "\u201cMotive is something that we really want to know as humans, but it\u2019s not legally a part of the crime,\u201d said Mary D. Fan, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at the University of Washington Law School.",
      "The Goncalves family criticized the agreement, saying the case should have gone to trial or that any deal should at least have required a full confession and the location of the murder weapon.",

      "Huffington, 62, always maintained his innocence. He was released from Patuxent Institution in 2013 after serving 32 years of two life sentences.",
      "He was convicted twice in the killings known as the \u201cMemorial Day Murders.\u201d Diane Becker was stabbed to death in her recreational vehicle, while her 4-year-old son, who was inside, was not harmed. Joseph Hudson, Becker\u2019s boyfriend, was fatally shot and found a few miles (kilometers) away.

      "Ranchers in southern Mexico face rising costs and limited government help to battle a flesh-eating parasite",
      "CINTALAPA, Mexico -- With Mexican cattle again barred this month from entry to the United States over fears of spreading a flesh-eating parasite, ranchers and veterinarians in Mexico hundreds of miles from the border are fighting what has U.S. agricultural authorities so on edge.",
      "In the southern state of Chiapas, which borders Guatemala, the New World screwworm fly\u2019s rapid spread appears to have caught most ranchers off guard, despite memories of previous outbreaks in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "Mexico is building a plant with U.S. support in Chiapas to produce sterile flies, which have proven effective at stopping the spread, but it won\u2019t be ready until next year. Meanwhile, the price of medicines used to treat livestock infected with the screwworm have soared in price.",
      "That has led some to fall back on home remedies like applying gasoline or lime to open wounds to coax out the worms.",
      "In addition to the cost of the medicine, treatment requires careful monitoring and usually involves multiple courses. Any open wound, even very small ones, are an invitation to the fly to lay its eggs.",
      "Veterinarian Alfredo Ch\u00e1vez left Chiapas to study in 1989, so he says he missed seeing the effects of that outbreak, but now he\u2019s seen cases multiply in his corner of the state over the past month.",
      "He\u2019s heard of dozens of cases in the area now and treated about a dozen himself. It\u2019s not just cows either \u2014 sheep, pigs, cats and dogs are targets as well.",
      "Armed with a pair of blue tweezers and an aerosol spray that helps draw the maggots out, Ch\u00e1vez moves from animal to animal. He puts maggots in plastic tubes as samples, which he provides to agricultural authorities.",
      "But beyond providing the tubes and encouraging ranchers to report cases, he said that the government hasn't provided much help.",

      "The U.S. had just gradually started to reopen the border to cattle imports this month after an earlier suspension in May, when the Trump administration said that it would close it again after an infected animal was found in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz. While prevalent in Central America, the concern is that the fly is moving north.",
      "U.S. officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its maggots could cause large economic losses, something that happened decades ago.",
      "Ranch caretaker Edi Valencia Santos said that Mexican government officials have come to his community to talk to people with livestock, but so far without resources. He has had five infected animals on the ranch.",
      "Despite cattle in this region going to domestic consumption rather than to the U.S., the presence of the screwworm in Mexico has frozen cattle exports to the U.S. nationwide.",
      "Valencia said that he remembers the small planes distributing sterile flies during those earlier outbreaks, so is optimistic they will eventually help, but for now the costs are piling up on ranchers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big, big problem in Chiapas,\u201d he said.",

      "A mother with doomsday religious beliefs is set to be sentenced Friday on murder conspiracy convictions in Arizona",
      "PHOENIX -- Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life sentences in Idaho in the killings of her two youngest children and a romantic rival, will be sentenced Friday on two murder conspiracy convictions in Arizona, signaling an end to a winding legal saga for the mother with doomsday religious beliefs who claimed people in her life had been possessed by evil spirits.",
      "In separate trials this spring in Arizona, Vallow Daybell was convicted of conspiring to murder her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, and her niece\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. Authorities say she carried out the plots with her brother Alex Cox, who acknowledged killing Vallow in July 2019 and was identified by prosecutors as the person who shot at Boudreaux months later but missed.",
      "Prosecutors say Vallow Daybell conspired to kill Vallow so she could collect on his $1 million life insurance policy and marry her then-boyfriend Chad Daybell, an Idaho author of several religious novels about prophecies and the end of the world. They say Boudreaux suspected Vallow Daybell and Cox were responsible for Vallow\u2019s death. Boudreaux then went into hiding with his children because he feared Cox would kill him, prosecutors said.",
      "Public interest in Vallow Daybell, 52, grew as the investigation into her own missing children \u2014 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u2019 Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 took several strange and unexpected turns. Their bodies were found buried in rural Idaho on Chad Daybell\u2019s property on June 9, 2020.",
      "Chad Daybell was sentenced to death in the killings of the children and his wife, Tammy, the romantic rival. Vallow Daybell was convicted of conspiring to kill Tammy.",
      "Prosecutors in Arizona are seeking life sentences on each of Vallow Daybell's latest convictions. Once sentenced in Arizona, Vallow Daybell will be sent back to prison in Idaho.",
      "Charles Vallow filed for divorce four months before he died. He said Vallow Daybell became infatuated with near-death experiences and claimed to have lived numerous lives on other planets. He told police she threatened to kill him and he was concerned for his children.",
      "Vallow was shot when he went to pick up his son at Vallow Daybell's home outside Phoenix, police said. Vallow Daybell's daughter, Tylee, told police the sound of yelling woke her up, and she confronted Vallow with a baseball bat to defend her mother. Vallow managed to take the bat from her.",
      "Cox told police that he shot Vallow after he refused to drop the bat and came after him.",
      "Cox died five months later from a blood clot in his lungs. His self-defense claim was later called into question, with investigators saying Cox and Vallow Daybell waited more than 40 minutes before calling 911.",
      "Right before his death, Vallow and his wife\u2019s other brother, Adam Cox, planned an intervention to try to bring Lori back into the mainstream of their shared faith in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",

      "Almost three months after Vallow died, someone fired a shot at Boudreaux from an open window of a Jeep as he was driving up to his home in Gilbert, another Phoenix suburb. It narrowly missed Boudreaux, the ex-husband of Vallow Daybell\u2019s niece, Melani Pawlowski.",
      "Boudreaux said Pawlowski aspired to be like her aunt. The two started attending religious meetings together in 2018. Soon after, Pawlowski said they should stockpile food for the end of the world.",
      "Prosecutors tied the Jeep to Vallow Daybell and said she loaned it to Alex Cox. The two bought a burner phone used to carry out the attack and tried to concoct an alibi for Cox to make it seem like he was in Idaho at the time, prosecutors said.",
      "Unlike her Idaho case, Vallow Daybell chose to represent herself at both Arizona trials, even though she isn\u2019t a lawyer.",
      "At her first trial, she argued her brother Alex Cox acted in self-defense when killing Vallow. She struggled with legal duties that most lawyers consider routine, such as lining up witnesses to testify.",

      "Pro wrestling icon Hulk Hogan has died, police and World Wrestling Entertainment said. He was 71.",
      "First responders were called to the Clearwater Beach, Florida, home of Hogan, whose real name was Terry Bollea,  around 9:50 a.m. Thursday, police said.",
      "\"The nature of the call was for a cardiac arrest,\" the Clearwater Police Department said in a statement. He was taken to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.",
      "\"There were no signs of foul play or suspicious activity,\" Maj. Nate Burnside told reporters.",
      "Hogan was perhaps the biggest star in WWE's long history. He was the main draw for the first WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon.",
      "He won at least six WWE championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.",
      "\"One of pop culture's most recognizable figures, Hogan helped WWE achieve global recognition in the 1980s. WWE extends its condolences to Hogan's family, friends, and fans,\" WWE said in\u00a0a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"Hulkamania,\" as the energy he created was called, started running wild in the mid-1980s and pushed professional wrestling into the mainstream. He was a flag-waving American hero with the horseshoe mustache, red and yellow gear and massive arms he called his \"24-inch pythons.\"",
      "Hogan was also a celebrity outside the wrestling world, appearing in numerous movies and television shows, including a reality show about his life on VH1, \"Hogan Knows Best.\"",
      "In recent years, Hogan added his celebrity to politics. At the 2024 Republican National Convention, he merged classic WWE maneuvers with then-candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric to passionately endorse him for president.",
      "\"Let Trumpamania run wild brother! Let Trumpamania rule again! Let Trumpamania make America great again!\" Hogan shouted into the raucous crowd.",
      "He ripped off a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of himself on a motorcycle to reveal a bright red Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath. Trump stood to applaud the move.",
      "\"We lost a great friend today, the 'Hulkster,'\" President Trump wrote on his social media site Thursday.",
      "He praised Hogan's speech at the RNC, calling it \"absolutely electric\" and \"one of the highlights of the entire week.\"",
      "\"He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Hogan lately began to invest in alternatives to theatrical, professional wrestling, announcing plans in April to serve as the first commissioner for the Real American Freestyle organization, which describes itself as \"the first unscripted pro wrestling\" league in the world. The first event is Aug. 30 at Cleveland State University.",
      "\"The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,\" Hogan said. \"People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.\"",
      "Hogan first became champion in what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, and pro wrestling took off from there. His popularity helped lead to the creation of the annual WrestleMania event in 1985, when he teamed up with Mr. T to beat \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the main event.",
      "He slammed and beat Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III in 1987, and the WWF gained momentum. His feud with the late \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage \u2014 perhaps his greatest rival \u2014 carried pro wrestling even further.",
      "Hogan was a central figure in what is known as the Monday Night Wars. The WWE and World Championship Wrestling were battling for ratings supremacy in 1996. Hogan tilted things in WCW's favor with the birth of the Hollywood Hogan character and the formation of the New World Order, a villainous stable that put WCW ahead in the ratings.",
      "He returned to the WWE in 2002 and became a champion again. His match with The Rock at WrestleMania X8, a loss during which fans cheered for his \"bad guy\" character, was seen as a passing of the torch.",
      "Hogan was perhaps as well known for his larger-than-life personality as he was his in-ring exploits. He was beloved for his \"promos\" \u2014 hype sessions he used to draw fans into matches. He often would play off his interviewer, \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund, starting his interviews off with, \"Well, lemme tell ya something, Mean Gene!\"",
      "In 2016, a Florida jury awarded Hogan $115 million in a lawsuit against Gawker Media and then added $25 million in punitive damages. Hogan sued after Gawker in 2012 posted a video of him having sex with his former best friend's wife. He contended the post violated his privacy.",
      "Hogan smiled and wore black throughout the three-week trial.",
      "\"Everywhere I show up, people treat me like I'm still the champ,\" he said of the support from fans.",

      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Skydance has made written commitments to ensuring that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum and that CBS's reporting will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based,\" Carr said in the statement.",
      "Carr also noted the company's commitment to local news coverage and said Skydance \"will work closely with its affiliated broadcast stations to ensure a productive partnership that will strengthen its affiliates' ability to serve their local communities.\"",
      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",
      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",
      "\"It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America,\" Gomez said.",

      "Simon has been with \"60 Minutes\" for 25 years, most recently serving as interim executive producer since the departure of the show's previous leader, Bill Owens, in April. She is just the fourth executive producer in the broadcast's 57-year history, and the first woman in the role.",
      "\"Tanya Simon understands what makes '60 Minutes' tick. She is an innovative leader, an exceptional producer, and someone who knows how to inspire people,\" Cibrowski said in a statement. \"Tanya knows that the success of today's '60 Minutes' depends on delivering a weekly mix of the most informative, impactful and entertaining stories and investigative journalism from around the world.

I'm deeply committed to this level of excellence and I look forward to delivering an exciting season of signature '60' stories that cover a wide range of subjects for a broad audience and engage viewers with their world.\"",

She previously served as the executive editor of \"60 Minutes\" for six seasons, helping to oversee the program's editorial process. Prior to that, she was a senior producer whose responsibilities included overseeing digital content for 60MinutesOvertime.com and supervising production of \"60 Minutes Sports,\" a monthly program that ran on Showtime.",

      "She joined the staff in 2000, working with correspondent Ed Bradley on a wide range of stories, including reports on the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Duke University lacrosse rape case, and a rare interview with Bob Dylan. Simon went on to produce for nearly all of the \"60 Minutes\" correspondents over the next decade, including Steve Kroft, Lesley Stahl, Scott Pelley, Anderson Cooper, and Bob Simon, her father. During that time, she produced news-making interviews with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and hero pilot Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger, as well as profiles of rapper Eminem and Olympic snowboarding gold medalist Shaun White. She reported extensively on Boston Irish mob boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger, including his capture after 16 years on the run, and on Lance Armstrong's use of performance-enhancing drugs to win bicycle races.",

    "story": [
      "Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are back together \u2014 sort of.\u00a0 A week after setting off a firestorm of speculation, Nicks and Buckingham announced that their first studio album, \"Buckingham Nicks,\" will be officially reissued in all formats, including digital, for the first time in the U.S. since the early 1980s.",
      "The former Fleetwood Mac bandmates shared a pair of cryptic messages across their Instagram accounts last week which combined to read, \"And if you go forward\u2026 I'll meet you there\" \u2014 lyrics from \"Frozen Love,\" a song off the duo's fabled 1973 album. Social media lit up with discussion of a possible reunion, seven years after Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac.",
      "On Wednesday, Nicks and Buckingham jointly posted a video of a billboard advertising the album's reissue going up in Los Angeles, announcing in the post's caption that the first single from the release, a newly remastered edition of \"Crying In The Night,\" was available now to stream.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham released \"Buckingham Nicks\" shortly before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1974. It was a commercial failure, resulting in their label, Polydor Records, dropping the pair from their contract. The album's last official release was a 1981 vinyl pressing from Polydor, according to Discogs, but the record has never been available on CD or digital, although bootlegs have surfaced over the years.",
      "Now, premium vinyl record producer Rhino High Fidelity is gearing up to release the full album on Sept. 19, alongside fresh liner notes from music journalist David Fricke, including interviews with both Buckingham and Nicks.",
      "\"[We] knew what we had as a duo, two songwriters that sang really well together. And it was a very natural thing, from the beginning.\" Nicks is quoted as saying in a Rhino press release. Buckingham said the album \"stands up in a way you hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work.\"",
      "The remastered album is now available to pre-order in a standard edition and a deluxe edition, which includes two 7-inch singles, \"Crying In The Night\" and \"Don't Let Me Down Again.\" The standard edition is limited to 5,000 copies, while the singles are numbered to 2,000.",
      "Rumors of a possible \"Buckingham Nicks\" reissue have percolated for years. Back in 2011, Buckingham told Rolling Stone that the album has \"been a victim of inertia. It's funny, I spent a lot of time with Stevie this year when she was finishing her album and we were getting along great. We have every intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can't put any specifics on that.\"",
      "Rhino sourced the audio for the remastered vinyl from the duo's original analog master tapes of the album, which was recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, not far from the billboard announcing its long-awaited return.",

      "Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy metal legend who rose to fame in the pioneering group Black Sabbath, has died, his family said in a statement to CBS News. He was 76.",
      "\"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,\" the family said in the statement. \"He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\"",
      "The family's statement didn't provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding Osbourne's death.",
      "Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the movement disorder affecting the nervous system that gets worse over time. A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",
      "Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents' groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \"The Osbournes.\"",
      "The Big Bang of heavy metal",
      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",
      "The original Sabbath lineup reunited for the first time in 20 years in July 2025 in the U.K. for what Osborne said would be his final concert. \"Let the madness begin!\" he told 42,000 fans.",
      "Metallica, Guns N Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Halestorm, Anthrax, Rival Sons and Mastodon did sets. Tom Morello, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Billy Corgan, Ronnie Wood, Travis Barker, Sammy Hagar, Andrew Watt, Yungblud, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Nuno Bettencourt, Chad Smith and Vernon Reid made appearances. Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",
      "\"Black Sabbath: we'd all be different people without them, that's the truth,\" said Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. \"I know I wouldn't be up here with a microphone in my hand without Black Sabbath.\"",
      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",
      "He is survived by Sharon, and his children.",

      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "The Red Cross said two adult men were treated on-site and one was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition. They tried to resuscitate Warner, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Department said the other person involved in the incident had \"entered the sea to try to help Mr. Warner.\"",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",
      "Warner also directed episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" according to his biography on his website.",
      "Most recently, he appeared in a few episodes of \"Alert: Missing Persons Unit\" and was hosting the podcast \"Not All Hood,\" looking at the different experiences of Black Americans.",
      "Warner was also a poet and a musician. He won a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance in 2015 for his part in a cover of Stevie Wonder's \"Jesus Children of America,\" and was nominated for another Grammy for best spoken word poetry.",
      "Fellow poet and author Kevin Powell, who was a friend of Warner's, described him as a devoted husband and father who was humble, kind and supportive of other people.",
      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",
      "Cosby shared a memory of Warner with CBS News' Jericka Duncan on Monday, saying, \"He was never afraid to go to his room and study and make sure he followed whatever he had learned in the acting school he went to.\"",
      "He said they had last spoken about three months ago, when they chatted about Warner's successful pivot to music. \"He was very proud of what he had done,\" Cosby said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a disagreement almost immediately as the two men set foot in the Fed's headquarters in Washington on Thursday to survey an\u00a0extensive renovation project\u00a0on two of the reserve's buildings.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump indicated that Powell's\u00a0handling of\u00a0the massive project and its cost overruns could be grounds for firing. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.",
      "Mr. Trump and Powell appeared side by side on the construction site Thursday \u2014 both in hard hats \u2014 with the president insisting costs have increased further, reaching $3.1 billion. Powell shook his head and said he hadn't heard that figure from anyone at the Fed. Mr. Trump handed a document to Powell, who put on his glasses to review it.",
      "\"You just added in a third building is what that is \u2014 that's a third building,\" Powell said of the Federal Reserve's Martin building.",
      "\"Well, I know but it's a building that's being built,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"No \u2014 it was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,\" Powell told the president.",
      "\"It's part of the overall work,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"It's not new,\" Powell reiterated.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Powell if he expects any further cost overruns. Powell said he does not. The project is expected to be completed in 2027.",
      "After a tour of the construction site, Mr. Trump called the project \"a very luxurious situation.\" But asked if the project's cost and overruns are a fireable offense for Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"Look, I would love to see it completed. I don't want to put that in this category. It's a very complex thing that could have been made simple.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he feels \"good\" about his relationship with Powell and they had a \"productive\" conversation Thursday, but reiterated that interest rates need to come down.",
      "\"I just want to see one thing happen, very simple \u2014 interest rates have to come down,\" he said.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump why he doesn't fire Powell now, instead of replacing him when his term is up in 2026.",
      "\"To do that is a big move, I just don't think it's necessary,\" the president responded. \"And I believe he's going to do the right thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year \u2014 after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",
      "Fed staff also pointed to the complication of historic renovations \u2014 both buildings have significant preservation needs. Constructing a new building on an empty site would have been cheaper.",

    "summary": "Paramount Global and Skydance Media agreed to merge last year.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Skydance has made written commitments to ensuring that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum and that CBS's reporting will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based,\" Carr said in the statement.",
      "Carr also noted the company's commitment to local news coverage and said Skydance \"will work closely with its affiliated broadcast stations to ensure a productive partnership that will strengthen its affiliates' ability to serve their local communities.\"",
      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",
      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",
      "\"It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America,\" Gomez said.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

But I think desperate times call for desperate measures.\"",

      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration told CBS MoneyWatch it would continue issuing paper checks for beneficiaries, including recipients of retirement and disability benefits, who have no other means of getting\u00a0payments. But the program will also emphasize the advantages of electronic transfers to its roughly 70 million beneficiaries in an effort to encourage check recipients to switch, a Social Security spokesperson added.",
      "The about-face comes after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0on July 14 that it would phase out paper checks beginning in October, citing the advantages of electronic deposits including faster payment processing and enhanced security. Eliminating paper also saves the federal government money, with checks costing 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer, the agency said at the time.",
      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",

It's expected to include a mix of both personal time, and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",

But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",

      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

      "\"American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world.

They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",

      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",

      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",
      "Simon Quilty, an analyst with Global Agri Trends, agreed that it was unlikely Australian consumers would soon see U.S. beef in on their grocery stores shelves.",
      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",
      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data.

      "\"The daunting power of AI is really, it's not going to be a reason for retreat from this new frontier,\" Mr. Trump said. \"On the contrary, it is the more reason we must ensure it is pioneered first and best.\"",
      "AI is like a \"beautiful baby that's born,\" he said of the technology's current state.",
      "\"We have to grow that baby and let that baby thrive,\" the president said. That means allowing some regulation, but also cutting red tape, he said.",
      "The president thanked companies present at the summit for investing in data centers and other projects, saying they'll create thousands of jobs.",
      "The Wednesday announcement is co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four technology investors and entrepreneurs who include Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar David Sacks.",
      "\"The goal here is for the United States to win the AI race,\" Sacks said during a press call with reporters Wednesday morning.",
      "The plan is backed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and will be carried out over the next six months to a year, according to Michael Kratsios, policy director of the OSTP.",
      "\"This is a watershed day for Trump to lay out the AI vision and make sure the U.S. stays ahead of China despite all the trade deal turmoil,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What is the AI Action Plan?",
      "The AI Action Plan focuses on accelerating AI innovation and building out AI infrastructure to ensure the U.S. leads in international \"AI diplomacy,\" according to Sacks, who laid out the plan's major pillars during Wednesday's call.",
      "That includes expediting the construction of large-scale data centers, which house servers, networking gear and other technology used to power artificial intelligence.",
      "Thousands of data centers are scattered around the U.S. Most are connected to the nation's power grid and rely on massive amounts of electricity to operate. The proliferation of AI data centers has been cited as one of the drivers of burgeoning energy costs.",
      "The number of data centers is only expected to grow as technology companies \u2014 including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI \u2014 ramp up construction to meet the nation's growing energy demand stemming from the emergence of AI.",
      "In addition to investments in data centers, the new White House plan also focuses on \"expediting and modernizing programs\" for semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, and updating the nation's electric grid to support the enormous energy demands of AI supercomputing, Kratsios said.",
      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",
      "To that end, Kratsios said the plan will update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with AI developers whose systems \"allow free speech expression to flourish.\"",
      "The plan also seeks to maintain the U.S.' edge in the global race for AI dominance as it competes with countries like China, which has moved quickly to expand its AI capabilities. A senior White House official said the report supports export controls to make sure \"that our most advanced technology doesn't get into the hands of [other] countries.\"",
      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",
      "DEI regulations within the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act \"burden the industry\" and \"slow down the delivery of critical projects,\" they said.",

    "summary": "The fallout from Elon Musk's dive into politics a year ago is still weighing on Tesla sales, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "The fallout from Elon Musk's plunge into politics a year ago is still hammering electric vehicle-maker Tesla, as both sales and profits dropped sharply again in the latest quarter.",
      "Tesla revenue dropped 12%, and profits slumped 16% in the three months through June as buyers continued to steer clear, and in some cases, turn to more affordable competitors' offerings.",
      "\"The perception of Elon Musk, its chief executive, has rubbed the sheen right out of what once was a darling and soaring automotive brand,\" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said in a research note, in which he called Tesla \"a toxic brand that is inseparable from its leader.\"",
      "Quarterly profits at the electric vehicle, battery and robotics company fell to $1.17 billion, or $0.33 a share, from $1.4 billion, or $0.40 a share, dropping for a third straight quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company said it earned $0.40, in line with Wall Street analysts' estimates.",
      "Revenue fell from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion in the April through June period, slightly beating Wall Street's forecast.",
      "Tesla shares were little changed in after-hours trading as investors awaited Musk's comments on the company's earnings call.",
      "Betting on robotaxis",
      "Musk, who helped elect President Donald Trump with a massive campaign donation and then headed his DOGE cost-cutting program, has pinned the future of the company squarely on its autonomous Robotaxi venture, which launched in Austin, Texas last month. It's expected to take years, though, before Musk's focus on robotaxis and humanoid robots turns a profit or the company.",
      "\"We are at a 'positive crossroads' in the Tesla story: Musk is laser focused as CEO, Robotaxi/autonomous expansion has begun, demand stabilization has begun especially in China, and Tesla is about to embark on an aggressive AI focused strategy that we believe will include owning a significant piece of xAI,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note. \"While near-term and this quarter the numbers are nothing to write home about, we believe investors are instead focused on the AI future at Tesla with a motivated Musk back driving Tesla's future.\"",
      "Foreign EV buyers have also turned away from Tesla toward competitors' vehicles, research shows. Musk alienated potential Tesla customers in Great Britain, France, Germany and elsewhere through his political activities. Rival electric vehicle makers such as China's BYD and German's Volkswagen, meanwhile, have gained market share.",
      "Tesla faces other headwinds, too. The new federal budget just passed by Congress eliminates a $7,500 credit for EV buyers. It also wipes out penalties for car makers that exceed carbon emission standards. That threatens Tesla's business of selling its \"carbon credits\" to traditional car companies that regularly fall short of emission standards.",
      "Tesla generated $439 million from credit sales, down sharply from $890 million a year ago.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:48:17 -0400",
    "summary": "The Education Department has temporarily paused loan forgiveness for an income-based repayment plan. Here are the details.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",

      "The majority of the world's cocoa supply comes from Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which have faced heatwaves and heavy rain linked to climate change. These unfavorable weather conditions have led to diseases like Black pod rot, which kills cocoa crops. Chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms is another reason behind the spike in cocoa prices,\u00a0according to an article from J.P. Morgan Global Research.",
      "\"Cocoa is a market where the grower produces a very high-value good but receives a very low share of the actual value chain.

    "story": [
      "Target is ending a price matching policy that for\u00a012 years\u00a0allowed customers to request a price match if they found an identical item with a lower cost at competitors Amazon or Walmart.",
      "The\u00a0policy\u00a0enabled a price match if shoppers could provide proof of the lower price within 14 days of their purchase. The product had to be identical in brand name, size, weight, color and model number, and had to be sold and fulfilled by Amazon or Walmart, according to the Target policy.",
      "After July 28, customers will only be able to request a price match for products sold at either Target or Target.com, not competitors Amazon and Walmart, according to a Target spokesperson. The company said that it's ending price matching for products sold by the two rival retailers because \"guests overwhelmingly price match Target and not other retailers.\"",
      "Target introduced its competitor price match policy in 2013. At the time, former Target CEO and president Gregg Steinhafel said the policy provided \"unbeatable value.\"",
      "Other retailers that have price matching policies include Best Buy and\u00a0Home Depot. Walmart also has a price matching policy, although it's for Walmart.com, not competitors.",
      "Target's decision to end its price matching policy comes as the retailer is struggling to boost sales and store traffic. In its most recent earnings report released in May, the company reported a nearly 3% decline in sales during the first quarter compared to the same time last year.",
      "At the time, Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer was navigating an \"exceptionally challenging environment,\" citing declining consumer confidence and uncertainty around tariffs as some of the headwinds.",
      "Other retailers are also facing challenges as consumers pull back on spending. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which tracks Americans' sentiment toward business and labor market conditions, fell 5.4 points in June, a sign consumers may be more cautious about the state of the economy.",

    "story": [
      "Southwest Airline's open seating policy is coming in for its final approach.",
      "The Texas-based carrier said Monday that flights with assigned seats will begin on Jan. 27, 2026, marking the end of an era\u00a0in which the discount carrier for decades bucked industry norms by having passengers choose their seats during boarding.",
      "Southwest, which announced last year that it was abandoning open seating, said customers can start booking flights with assigned seats starting on July 29.",
      "\"Assigned seating unlocks new opportunities for our Customers \u2014 including the ability to select Extra Legroom seats \u2014 and removes the uncertainty of not knowing where they will sit in the cabin,\" Tony Roach, executive vice president of customer & brand at Southwest Airlines, said in a statement.",
      "The new policy will allow travelers to choose from\u00a0different fare bundles and seat options, including those offering more legroom. A Southwest spokesperson said the airline is unable for now to offer details on how its fares will change under the new reservation system.",
      "The airline also recently did away with its \"bags fly free\" policy, signaling a broader shift in its revenue strategy amid mounting financial pressure. People who book flights on or after May 28 must pay $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second.",
      "New boarding process",
      "Southwest also announced on Monday that it is overhauling its boarding process.",
      "The new boarding sequence will group passengers based on seat location, with priority given to people who choose seats with extra legroom and to loyalty program members. Southwest customers can also pay for priority boarding if they want to move up in the queue.",

      "The federal agency said in a recall\u00a0notice\u00a0that the pools, which were manufactured in China and sold by multiple U.S. vendors, have a compression strap along the outside that can allow children to gain access and drown. Children are able to enter the pool even when the ladder is removed, the CPSC said.",
      "The children who drowned were between 22 months and 3 years old, according to the agency. The deaths took place between 2007 and 2002 in California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri. The CPSC said it's also aware of three separate instances when children gained access to the recalled pools using the compression strap.",
      "The pools, which are 48 inches high and taller, have been sold by outdoor recreation companies Bestway, Intex and Polygroup since 2002 at retail stores across the U.S., including Amazon.com, Lowe's, Target and Walmart, among others. Over 250,000 were also sold in Canada. They range in price from $400 to over $1,000, according to the CPSC.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a spokesperson for Bestway, Intex and Polygroup said the three companies started working with the CPSC in 2023 to update the safety standard for above-ground pools. The updated standard, finalized in May 2025, \"aims to prevent unsupervised children from gaining a foothold on the products from compression straps that surround the outside of the pool legs,\" the companies' statement said.",

      "Balmedie, Scotland\u00a0\u2014 President Trump is due to arrive in Scotland Friday for a four-day private trip \u2014 his first to the U.K since he was re-elected. The White House says he'll meet near the end of his visit with Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss trade, but he'll also be opening a brand-new course at the Trump International Golf Links.",
      "Set on Scotland's rugged northeast coast, it's a stunningly beautiful location, and it's easy to see why President Trump was keen to purchase the site more than a decade ago and develop it into a world-class golf club.",
      "But as CBS News learned from speaking with locals, many struggle to separate the American President's politics from his putting green.",
      "David Milne bought his old Coast Guard look-out on the Aberdeenshire coast over 20 years ago, and he still lives there today. But since 2012, it's been right in the middle of Trump territory, surrounded by hundreds of acres of shifting sand dunes that have been meticulously sculpted into 36 holes that anyone can play a round on \u2014 for about $500.",
      "Milne isn't happy about his new neighbor.",
      "\"It's always second-best to what was there originally,\" he told CBS News. \"When I came in here, this landscape was untouched\u2026 now it's just a golf course .\"",
      "Mr. Trump first purchased the land in 2006, and during development he offered to buy some of the neighbors' places, too, but Milne refused to sell.",
      "In 2011, Mr. Trump said he didn't like the look of Milne's property anyway.",
      "\"Who cares,\" the future president told the Golf Channel, pointing to Milne's home. \"We're trying to build the greatest course in the world. The house is ugly.\"",
      "Asked what the land means to himself and his family, Milne said it was much more than just a patch of picturesque coastline.",
      "\"Land is what Scotland is. Not just financially, it's in the soul of the Scottish people as well. It is where we come from, and where we go back to,\" he said.",
      "The visit to Scotland is a homecoming for Mr. Trump, too. His mother, born Mary Anne MacLeod in 1912, grew up on a the Scottish Hebridean island of Lewis. He named one of his courses in Aberdeenshire after her.",
      "Mr. Trump has been met with protests on previous visits, and vandalism at his golf courses has taken a political tone in recent months.",
      "Tommy Campbell, a veteran labor union activist in Scotland, told CBS News he was planning to lead another protest during the U.S. leader's visit this weekend, with a clear message for Mr. Trump:",
      "\"You are not welcome here,\" he said. \"The policies that he represents are completely at odds with what we value here.\"",
      "A poll conducted in February found around 70% of Scots have an unfavorable opinion of President Trump. In the village near his golf links, CBS News spoke with the members of a walking club, who hold a grudge.",
      "\"The way he treated the neighbors and property owners, I think that influenced us all badly,\" said one woman.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 08:07:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The federal district court in New Jersey appointed Alina Habba's deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to serve as U.S. attorney.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday withdrew the nomination of Alina Habba, his former defense lawyer, to serve as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, a Justice Department official confirmed, which clears the way for her to serve as the U.S. attorney in the state in an acting capacity.",
      "Mr. Trump's move came after a federal district court set off a leadership scramble in the U.S. attorney's office when it declined to keep Habba in the role of U.S. attorney and instead installed Desiree Leigh Grace as the state's top federal prosecutor.",
      "Grace, who was Habba's deputy, was selected by the judges on the U.S. district court in New Jersey to serve as the U.S. attorney for the state as Habba's 120-day term in the post wound down. But shortly after, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Grace had been removed as first assistant U.S. attorney, and she excoriated the judges for tapping Grace, instead of letting Habba stay in the role.",
      "\"This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges \u2014 especially when they threaten the president's core Article II powers,\" Bondi wrote on social media.",
      "The attorney general's post raised questions about who would be the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey as the 120-day clock on Habba's interim term expires. A court order signed by Chief Judge Renee Bumb said Grace's appointment was effective Tuesday or \"upon the expiration of 120 days after\" Habba's appointment by Bondi.",
      "But Habba said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X, \"I am now the Acting United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey\" and indicated she would fight for the job. The Justice Department official confirmed that Mr. Trump pulled Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney, which avoids a provision of federal law that restricts\u00a0a person\u00a0from serving as an acting officer if the president has submitted their nomination to the Senate. That law limits her time as acting U.S. attorney to 210 days from when the vacancy occurred.",
      "Mr. Trump announced on March 24 that he had tapped Habba to serve as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which would put the expiration of her term at July 22. But Todd Blanche, deputy attorney general, has said her tenure as interim U.S. attorney ends Friday.",
      "Habba has the Justice Department leaders behind her, and they've accused New Jersey judges of playing politics with their decision not to keep Habba in the post.",
      "Mr. Trump had nominated Habba for the role of U.S. attorney, but New Jersey's two home-state senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, oppose her.",
      "\"President Trump continues to have full confidence in Alina Habba and her commitment to serve the people of New Jersey,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Habba was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in several civil cases brought against him in New York, and she joined the White House as a counselor to the president after Mr. Trump won a second term. The president announced in March that he had tapped Habba to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in her home state of New Jersey. Federal law limited her time as interim U.S. attorney to 120 days.",
      "Habba deserves the job, according to Armen Morian, who worked alongside Habba in a 2023 New York civil case in which Mr. Trump, his company and top executives were found liable for fraud.",
      "\"I think she's eminently qualified to be U.S. attorney, and I think she's doing a fine job of it,\" Morian said.",
      "Morian hit back at Habba's critics who questioned her suitability for the job, having never previously been a prosecutor.",
      "\"President Trump is a very unconventional figure, and he forces us, I think, to reconsider a lot of the assumptions we make. Sometimes it's very useful to put somebody into an office who has shown to you that she has sufficient judgment and will do well in the position,\" Morian said.",
      "But the state's two senators, Booker and Kim, opposed her nomination. Under the Senate Judiciary Committee's \"blue slip\" policy, a nomination for U.S. attorney or to a federal district court will not move forward unless both home-state senators return positive blue slips.",
      "With the 120-day deadline on Habba's term approaching, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. district court in New Jersey invoked their power under federal law and voted to replace Habba with Grace, her deputy.",
      "Can judges even appoint the U.S. attorney?",
      "Yes. A federal statute governing U.S. attorney vacancies specifies that if the attorney general's appointment of a U.S. attorney expires after 120 days, the district court can name a U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "The law requires an order of appointment by the court to be filed with the clerk of the court.",
      "\"The reason why you have this 120-day deadline followed by judicial appointments was so that the president is incentivized to get someone confirmed because after 120 days, you lose the authority within the executive branch to control who is the U.S. attorney,\" Thomas Barry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "While rare, courts have exercised this power before.",
      "The judges on the U.S. district court in New Mexico selected Gregory Fouratt to serve as the top federal prosecutor in the state in January 2008, and in 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term, the district court in New Jersey appointed Craig Carpenito the state's U.S. attorney as his 120-day term was set to run out. Also that year, the U.S. district court in Manhattan tapped Geoffrey Berman to serve as the district's top federal prosecutor.",
      "But Berman's exit in June 2020 was rocked by confusion when then-Attorney General Bill Barr announced that Berman would be \"stepping down.\" Berman, however, said he had not resigned and had no intention of doing so. Barr then informed Berman that Mr. Trump had removed him from the post.",
      "Does Bondi have the power to remove a court-appointed U.S. attorney?",
      "It doesn't seem so. In a 1979 opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which is not binding, then-Assistant Attorney General John Harmon explained that \"the president is responsible for the conduct of a U.S. Attorney's Office and therefore must have the power to remove one he believes is an unsuitable incumbent, regardless of who appointed him.\"",
      "Harmon also said that when it comes to whether the attorney general has the authority to terminate a court-appointed U.S. attorney, \"We answer this questions [sic] in the negative.\" He said federal law regarding the removal of U.S. attorneys constitutes \"the specific exercise of legislative power under Article II, section 2, clause 2, vesting in the president the power of removing a court-appointed U.S. attorney.\"",
      "In a social media post, Blanche wrote that Grace had been ousted \"pursuant to the president's authority.\"",
      "\"This backroom vote will not override the authority of the Chief Executive,\" he wrote.",
      "Berry said there have been very few, if any, judicial decisions, about the removal of interim U.S. attorneys, especially if the attorney general disagrees with the court's appointment.",
      "Habba's appointment as acting U.S. attorney",
      "Until Thursday \u2014 because Mr. Trump had nominated her to serve as New Jersey's chief federal prosecutor \u2014 Habba did not appear to be eligible to serve as acting U.S. attorney in the state.",
      "The situation involving Habba and the U.S. attorney position in New Jersey potentially involved the interactions of two different federal laws: the statute governing U.S. attorney vacancies, which gives district courts the power to name someone to that role temporarily; and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 27-year-old law that limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Mr. Trump used the law, also known as the Vacancies Act, during his first term to install a number of \"acting\" leaders across the executive branch.",
      "Enacted in 1998, the Vacancies Act sets out three categories of federal workers who can move into a position covered by the law: the \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant office; another administration official who has been confirmed by the Senate; and an agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy occurred and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale.",
      "Grace, who the New Jersey judges selected to succeed Habba, was the first assistant.",
      "But the law prohibits a person from serving as an acting officer if the president has submitted their nomination to the Senate. The upper chamber received Habba's nomination from Mr. Trump on June 30. His withdrawal of her nomination now enables Habba to serve as acting U.S. attorney, as she resigned from the interim post \u2014 the role the district judges declined to keep her in \u2014 and was then appointed first assistant U.S. attorney by Bondi. Habba then could become acting U.S. attorney because the position is unfilled.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to have used the Vacancies Act to put at least one acting attorney general in place \u2014 John Sarcone who is currently leading the U.S. Attorney's Office in Albany.",
      "Bondi announced in early March that Sarcone had been appointed the interim top federal prosecutor for the Northern District of New York, but earlier this month, the U.S. district court there declined to tap him for U.S. attorney. Bondi instead named him \"special attorney to the attorney general,\" which effectively gives him the power of a U.S. attorney. Sarcone was named first assistant U.S. attorney as well, effectively leaving him in charge of the office.",
      "Berry said there is a loophole in the Vacancies Act that allows a lower-ranking official who does not require Senate confirmation to perform the duties of a senior leader when that role is vacant, which could be used to Habba's benefit.",
      "\"Subdelegation is so easy to do throughout the executive branch,\" he said. \"This exact same maneuver is done all the time for all sorts of offices.\"",
      "What happens to Grace?",
      "In a post Wednesday on LinkedIn, Grace indicated she is no longer the No. 2 in the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, but signaled she was prepared to follow the judges' order that names her the interim U.S. attorney, even though Bondi fired her from her post as the first assistant.",
      "\"It will forever be the greatest honor that they selected me on merit, and I'm prepared to follow that Order and begin to serve in accordance with the law,\" Grace wrote.",
      "The dozens of comments beneath Grace's LinkedIn post highlight her deep ties in the state, and high regard among New Jersey law enforcement.",
      "Minneapolis Chief of Police Brian O'Hara, who previously was Newark, New Jersey's Safety Director, congratulated Grace.",
      "\"Desiree Grace Anyone who knows you knows the heart, integrity, and commitment you bring to the job. You have definitely made a difference,\" O'Hara wrote.",

      "San Diego \u2014 The United States and Mexico have signed an agreement outlining specific steps and a new timetable to clean up the longstanding problem of the Tijuana River pouring sewage across the border and polluting California beaches, officials from both countries announced Thursday.",
      "Billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana have polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water. That's despite multiple efforts and millions of dollars that have been poured into addressing the problem over decades, including under the first Trump administration.",
      "\"There is a great commitment by the two countries to strengthen cooperation,\" Mexico's Environmental Secretary Alicia B\u00e1rcena said Thursday after meeting with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin in Mexico City for the signing of the memorandum of understanding.",
      "The accord comes three months after Zeldin flew to San Diego to meet with Mexican officials and visit the border.",
      "\"I smelled what a lot of residents in the community lived through and have to deal with,\" he said Thursday. \"I saw the degradation of the Tijuana River valley. I heard about the beaches that were closed. I met with the Navy Seals, who have had their training impacted. It was a powerful visit all around for me.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration is proud to deliver this massive environmental and national security win for Americans in the San Diego area who have been living with this disgusting raw sewage flowing into their communities for far too long,\" Zeldin said, according to CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB-TV.",
      "Under the agreement, Mexico will complete its allocation of $93 million toward infrastructure projects, including adhering to a specific schedule for priority projects spanning through 2027.",
      "The 120-mile-long Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana's wastewater treatment plants have aged, its population and industry -- including the manufacturing plants, known as maquiladoras that make U.S. goods - have boomed. At the same time, there has been an increase in the amount of toxins that have made their way into the river and into San Diego County - since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who don't even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "Since 2020, more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin has said.",
      "Zeldin said this agreement factors in \"population growth, operation and maintenance costs, and other variables that would make this solution durable and long term.\"",
      "He praised the new administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last October, for its willingness to address the issue.",
      "Sheinbaum said earlier Thursday that her government would expand a wastewater treatment plant that would reduce the contamination reaching the coast.",
      "\"There are other actions that were signed that we have to complete, that we're going to get done in the next year for the entire Tijuana sanitation system, for the entire metropolitan Tijuana area,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said the United States also has to make investments in the binational problem.",
      "Referring to another agreement to send more water to the U.S. to reduce Mexico's water debt in the Rio Grande, Sheinbaum said the Tijuana River agreement \"is a good example of how when our technical teams sit down, they can resolve a problem that seemed unsolvable.\"",

      "The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws.",
      "It comes less than a week after an off-duty\u00a0Customs and Border Patrol officer was shot in Manhattan by an undocumented immigrant. On Thursday, the DOJ charged two suspects, alleging they are Dominican Republic nationals in the U.S. illegally. Police sources told CBS News New York the NYPD believes the suspects to be associates of the Trinitarios gang.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan were furious after the shooting, with\u00a0Homan promising to \"flood the zone\" with immigration agents to go after undocumented immigrants, especially those with a history of violence.",
      "\"Sanctuary cities are sanctuaries for criminals, hard stop,\" Homan said.",
      "Sanctuary city laws in focus",
      "Homan expressed his irritation with sanctuary cities, especially New York, at the White House on Thursday, just hours before the Justice Department sued Mayor Eric Adams, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch and others for making it more difficult for immigration agents to arrest undocumented immigrants who commit crimes.",
      "\"The challenged provisions of New York City law reflect the City's intentional effort to obstruct the United States' enforcement of federal immigration law, by (among much else) impeding the consultation and communication between federal and local law enforcement officials that is necessary for the United States to enforce the law and keep Americans safe,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "\"New York City has released thousands of criminals on the streets to commit violent crimes against law-abiding citizens due to sanctuary city policies,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said. \"If New York City won't stand up for the safety of its citizens, we will.\"",
      "The New York Immigration Coalition called the lawsuit frivolous.",
      "\"Sanctuary policies simply tell all New Yorkers, regardless of your immigration status, that if you are a victim of a crime or witness a crime, feel free to go to law enforcement,\" said Murad Awawdeh, the organization's president and CEO. \"Localities as well as states have the right to create policies and laws that keep their constituencies safe, and that's what our sanctuary policies do.\"",
      "Federal officials have been particularly upset that the City Council went to court to stop an executive order issued by the Adams administration to allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to work on Rikers Island, where they could identify undocumented immigrants who may be in the country illegally and have committed crimes.",
      "\"We're going to flood the zones\"",
      "\"I made a statement the other day about New York. We're going to flood the zones. The sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don't want, more agents in the communities and more worksite enforcement. Why is that? Because they won't let one agent arrest one bad guy in a jail. They're going to release a public safety threat back in the community. Now, I've got to send the whole team to go find that person. So you know, we're going to find the bad guy whether they help us or not,\" Homan said.",
      "City Hall responded with the following statement:",
      "\"The job of a mayor is to protect the safety of every single person in their city -- and that's exactly what Mayor Adams has worked to do every day for nearly four years. Keeping New Yorkers safe also means making sure they feel safe, and Mayor Adams has been clear: no one should be afraid to dial 911, send their kids to school, or go to the hospital, and no New Yorker should feel forced to hide in the shadows. That's why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council -- but he has also been clear they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and has urged the Council to re-examine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer. So far, the Council has refused. We will review the lawsuit,\" a spokesperson for Mayor Adams said.",

    "summary": "President Trump visited the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, keeping up the intense pressure he's been putting on Fed chair Jerome Powell.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a disagreement almost immediately as the two men set foot in the Fed's headquarters in Washington on Thursday to survey an\u00a0extensive renovation project\u00a0on two of the reserve's buildings.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump indicated that Powell's\u00a0handling of\u00a0the massive project and its cost overruns could be grounds for firing. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.",
      "Mr. Trump and Powell appeared side by side on the construction site Thursday \u2014 both in hard hats \u2014 with the president insisting costs have increased further, reaching $3.1 billion. Powell shook his head and said he hadn't heard that figure from anyone at the Fed. Mr. Trump handed a document to Powell, who put on his glasses to review it.",
      "\"You just added in a third building is what that is \u2014 that's a third building,\" Powell said of the Federal Reserve's Martin building.",
      "\"Well, I know but it's a building that's being built,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"No \u2014 it was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,\" Powell told the president.",
      "\"It's part of the overall work,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"It's not new,\" Powell reiterated.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Powell if he expects any further cost overruns. Powell said he does not. The project is expected to be completed in 2027.",
      "After a tour of the construction site, Mr. Trump called the project \"a very luxurious situation.\" But asked if the project's cost and overruns are a fireable offense for Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"Look, I would love to see it completed. I don't want to put that in this category. It's a very complex thing that could have been made simple.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he feels \"good\" about his relationship with Powell and they had a \"productive\" conversation Thursday, but reiterated that interest rates need to come down.",
      "\"I just want to see one thing happen, very simple \u2014 interest rates have to come down,\" he said.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump why he doesn't fire Powell now, instead of replacing him when his term is up in 2026.",
      "\"To do that is a big move, I just don't think it's necessary,\" the president responded. \"And I believe he's going to do the right thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year \u2014 after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",
      "Fed staff also pointed to the complication of historic renovations \u2014 both buildings have significant preservation needs. Constructing a new building on an empty site would have been cheaper.",

    "story": [
      "Three fired Justice Department officials filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday, after they were part of a wave of terminations from the agency earlier this summer.",
      "The plaintiffs in Thursday's suit include Michael Gordon, a longtime federal prosecutor who also handled January 6 cases. He was fired last month while handling a high-level fraud case against a Florida man accused of fleecing children with special needs out of millions of dollars. The lawsuit says the firing \"came as a particular shock\" to Gordon because he was picked to help lead that case, and he was \"personally congratulated\" by officials.",
      "Also joining the suit: Joseph Tirrell, the department's former top ethics official, and Patty Hartman, a public affairs specialist who oversaw press releases about Jan. 6 cases and helped maintain the content of an online Justice Department database on Capital siege cases.",
      "In their lawsuit, the three officials say they were told of their firings in one-page memos signed by Bondi that didn't offer any specific reason for the termination. The memos cited Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which lays out the powers of the president.",
      "The suit argues Bondi and the Justice Department did not follow the normal procedures that govern how and when civil servants can be fired. They ask a judge to order the Trump administration to \"immediately reinstate\" them as Justice Department employees, and award back pay as needed.",
      "\"The Attorney General does not have absolute authority to simply remove DOJ employees. Specifically, there are crucial guardrails that protect employees from arbitrary or unlawful termination,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "On Tirell's termination, the suit also says he is owed protections as a member of the Senior Executive Service \u2014 a category of senior-level government employees who aren't appointed by the president \u2014 and as a Navy veteran.",
      "\"Specifically, it is a Prohibited Personnel Practice to 'knowingly take, recommend, or approve any personnel action if the taking of such action would violate a veterans' preference requirement,'\" the suit read, referring to federal rules that give former members of the military certain preferences in government jobs.",
      "Normally, the suit says, the plaintiffs would be able to go to a federal agency called the Merit Systems Protection Board to appeal their firings. But the MSPB has been hobbled by President Trump's decision to fire a board member, making any filing there \"futile,\" the plaintiffs say.",
      "Dozens of Justice Department staffers have been fired, CBS News has previously reported. The firings include prosecutors and officials who worked on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, as well as people linked to the criminal investigations into Mr. Trump.",
      "Within weeks of Mr. Trump's inauguration, top officials directed the FBI to put together a list of agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases \u2014 a sweeping dragnet since the Capitol riot investigation was the largest in Justice Department history, ensnaring over 1,000 defendants. Meanwhile, Bondi set up a \"weaponization working group\" tasked with reviewing the two federal criminal prosecutions of Mr. Trump.",
      "After her firing, Hartman blasted the Justice Department in an interview with CBS News.",
      "\"There used to be a line, used to be a very distinct separation between the White House and the Department of Justice, because one should not interfere with the work of the other,\" Hartman told CBS News. \"That line is very definitely gone.\"",

    "story": [
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe \"strongly supports the public release\" this week of highly sensitive documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, according to a CIA spokesperson, who said Ratcliffe \"initiated\" the declassification process after he took the helm at the agency this year.",
      "Gabbard's office publicly released a report drafted in 2017 by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee on Russian activity during the 2016 election, sparking concerns about risks to sensitive sources and methods. She said Wednesday that the document contained additional evidence that Obama administration officials \"manufactured\" a narrative about Russia's actions that was designed to undercut President Trump.",
      "Gabbard also declassified a swath of documents related to the 2016 election last Friday.",
      "\"CIA Director Ratcliffe strongly supports the public release of HPSCI's report, which was the result of a process initiated by CIA and led by DNI Gabbard,\" the CIA spokesperson said, using an abbreviation for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.",
      "\"This effort reflects Director Ratcliffe's continued commitment to elevating the truth and bringing transparency to the American people and would not have been possible without his directive to return it to the committee,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The House report, which the committee's Republican staff finalized in December 2017 but updated through 2020, was so highly classified that it was stored at CIA headquarters before Ratcliffe sent it back to the House panel and ultimately toward public release, CBS News has learned.",
      "The committee made it available to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, according to an ODNI official with knowledge of the declassification process. Gabbard would normally have been required to consult with the intelligence agencies that had contributed sensitive information to the report before declassifying it, but Mr. Trump \u2014 who made the decision to declassify the document with relatively few redactions \u2014 was not under the same obligations, the official said.",
      "The report was written in large part by then-committee staffer Kash Patel, now the FBI director, according to one current and one former official. It contained discussions about raw intelligence from a CIA source the agency had recruited in Russia, and questioned whether analysts had sufficiently taken into account the source's motivations, proximity to Putin or potential bias towards Mr. Trump.",
      "The CIA source's information helped inform the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, or ICA, which concluded in part that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government aspired to help then-candidate Donald Trump's election chances by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. The U.S. exfiltrated a CIA asset from Russia in 2017, CBS News previously confirmed.",
      "That judgment within the ICA has vexed Mr. Trump for years and has been a key focus of Gabbard's recent declassifications.",
      "Gabbard has claimed the documents released by her office reveal a \"treasonous conspiracy\" by Obama-era officials to undermine Mr. Trump during his first term by alleging Russian efforts to help him win in 2016. Gabbard says she has forwarded the records to the Justice Department as part of a criminal referral.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush called Gabbard's accusations \"bizarre\" and \"ridiculous\" earlier this week.",
      "The ICA's judgement about Russian actions in 2016 was also the focus of a recent CIA internal review under Ratcliffe. Released earlier this month, that review contained far fewer of the sensitive details included in the House Republicans' report and said the judgment on Putin's preference for Trump should have been issued with moderate rather than high confidence. But it said it did not dispute the \"quality and credibility\" of the information.",
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, called the release of the House committee's report by Gabbard \"desperate and irresponsible.\" He said it put highly sensitive sources at risk and could disincentivize potential spies from working for the U.S. government.",
      "\"Tell me how you're going to recruit somebody to, in one of our adversarial nations, maybe work with us, if that information is carelessly thrown around,\" Warner said to reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Ratcliffe, who previously served on the House Intelligence Committee as a congressman from Texas, has said one of his primary objectives as CIA director would be to reinvigorate intelligence collection from human sources. Current and former national security officials have said intelligence provided by human sources, known as HUMINT, has dropped off in recent years, as surveillance technologies have become more sophisticated and ubiquitous.",
      "Human sources \u2014 especially those with proximity to world leaders in adversarial countries like Russia, China and North Korea \u2014 are especially prized and especially rare, given how risky, if not life-threatening, it can be for them to provide information to a foreign intelligence agency. Information provided by human sources typically remains classified for decades, often up to 75 years, according to government classification rules.",
      "At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Ratcliffe said the recruitment of human spies by the CIA is \"not where it needs to be.\"",
      "\"I do want to spend time looking at that,\" he said.",
      "The CIA has recently released recruitment videos in multiple languages with the aim of enticing potential human sources in Iran, China and Russia to come forward.",

However, that number is still well below the one million annual deportations which the Trump administration has targeted. The Department of Homeland Security has tracked over 13,000 self-deportations since the start of Mr. Trump's second term.",

He was issued a deportation order shortly after, and had been attending immigration check-ins regularly. But as immigration enforcement ramped up in the U.S., he worried he might be detained. And since Cuba is not accepting deportees, there was a risk he'd be sent elsewhere.",
      "\"It was a high risk of me, of the United States sending me to Salvador or South Sudan,\" he says, \" it was an easy choice\u2026 letting them send me to a country where I had, no, I didn't have the choice to go to or just deciding, coming over here to Mexico where I'm gonna have better opportunities in life.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said on July 20 that if the Commanders \"don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington.\" The team changed their name from the \"Washington Redskins\" five years ago, as the term is widely considered a racist slur against Native Americans, but Mr. Trump has recently revamped calls for a return to the old name.",
      "\"I think that everyone has been perplexed by the President's comments, and in that sense, they certainly have not been helpful. I don't know where they go. And I have actually characterized him as a distraction, in the many senses of that word,\" D.C. Council chairman Phil Mendelson said of Mr. Trump's comments at a press conference Thursday.",
      "The council is set to vote on the proposal on Aug. 1, with a second vote set for Sept. 17, according to Mendelson. Mendelson said he is \"confident that we will have the votes necessary\" to pass the agreement next week.",
      "In addition to the looming threats from the president, the D.C. Council and the Commanders also face the technical difficulties surrounding the transfer of control over the RFK Stadium property. While the stadium is located on federal land, the city was given permission by Congress in January to control the property for 99 years, which would allow for its redevelopment. The agreement reached today signals a step towards receiving approval from city councilors over the redevelopment plan, but the real test will come with the Aug. 1 vote.",
      "Regardless of the forthcoming roadblocks, the proposal seems to have widespread support, both from district politicians and residents.",
      "\"Bringing the Commanders home is about more than a stadium. It's about creating jobs, attracting revenue, and driving investment to Ward 7\u2014and it's coming at [a] time when we need it the most,\" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Thursday.",
      "The deal, as of its latest amendments, includes $950 million in revenue benefits for D.C., and is estimated to save district taxpayers $55 million, according Mendelson.",
      "\"A lot of the reaction that we got from residents, at least, that I heard, and I think my colleagues would agree, was that the deal could be better for the district. And I mean, I heard from many people, 'I support the team. I want the team in a district, but I think it could be a better deal.' And so I think the Commanders heard that,\" Mendelson said.",
      "The negotiations will likely continue, with possible additional amendments to be made later on, but while Mendelson said \"there's still a lot that has to be worked out in terms of legal documents,\" the current deal represents the \"basic framework\" of the agreement.",
      "Mendelson, who previously raised concerns over the proposal due to its costs, said he \"[put] aside my own view\" on the deal due to support from D.C. residents and his fellow council members, and has since been satisfied with the progress.",
      "\"[T]he Commanders have been very positive, constructive in our negotiations,\" Mendelson said. \"I have no complaint.\"",

    "story": [
      "New York City \u2014 George Pappas, Jennifer Peyton and Carla Espinoza were all federal immigration judges fired this month by email. The three ruled on thousands of immigration cases in Chicago and Boston.",
      "\"It was arbitrary, unfair,\" Pappas told CBS News of his firing. \"And it's an attack on the rule of law. It's an attack on judges.\"",
      "Pappas served as an immigration judge in Boston until this week, overseeing more than 2,000 cases during his two years on the bench. Peyton led Chicago's immigration court for nearly nine years, hearing thousands of cases until she was abruptly fired over the 4th of July weekend.",
      "Peyton oversaw Espinoza, who was appointed in 2023 and decided more than 1,000 cases in the last fiscal year, double the average for immigration judges.",
      "Peyton told CBS News she received no reason for her firing. Immigration judges are under the authority of the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review.",
      "\"My email was three sentences,\" Peyton said. \"I had no cause. I had no explanation.\"",
      "\"We as judges, were in fear, we were concerned,\" Espinoza added. \"That makes it very difficult to be impartial. We were not succumbing to that pressure but it does feel like pressure.\"",
      "Both Pappas and Peyton disclosed that they were told how they should rule on immigration cases.",
      "\"They told me: Grant the motions to dismiss,\" Pappas said. \"This is when ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) was roaming the courthouses. Because if we dismissed the case, that person that responded then leaves the court vulnerable to immediate apprehension and expedited removal.\"",
      "CBS News has reported on the numerous cases where ICE agents detained immigrants as they exited their court hearings.",
      "\"Once they left the courtroom, more often than not, they would be handcuffed and led away by the ICE officers,' Peyton added.",
      "According to the Executive Office for Immigration Review,  Federal immigration courts now face a backlog nearing four million cases, with about 600 judges left to hear those cases.",
      "The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, the union that represents immigration court judges, reports that since the Trump Administration took office, more than 100 immigration\u00a0 judges have either been fired, transferred, or have taken retirement offers.",
      "According to the union, immigration judges are considered Justice Department employees, and therefore do not have lifetime appointments like federal judges in the judicial branch.",
      "In a Truth Social post\u00a0in April, President Trump argued that, \"We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years.\"",
      "It is my opinion that this administration could give a hoot about the backlog,\" Pappas said.",
      "In defending its immigration crackdown, the White House has repeatedly argued that undocumented immigrants are in the U.S. illegally. And in May, the Trump administration began an effort to halt the immigration court cases of certain migrants in order to fast-track their deportation process, government officials and attorneys told CBS News at the time. Espinoza counters that the court system exists to ensure the law is followed, and attempts to circumvent it could prove to be a slippery slope.",
      "\"That's why they're in proceedings in court,\" Espinoza said of the immigrants. \"There is law that we're applying, and they might have to go, and they might not...Today it's them, it's immigrants. What about tomorrow? Who's going to get due process denied next.\"",
      "\"If you're attacking the very judges that adjudicate cases, there's not going to be a rule of law. That should concern everybody, not just immigrants, but U.S. citizens.\"",
      "When reached by CBS News, the Justice Department had no comment on the union's allegations that several immigration judges had been fired without cause.",
      "And in response to claims from former judges that the firings are a targeted attack on immigration courts, the Justice Department said, \"To the contrary, the Trump Administration is vigorously enforcing our nation's immigration laws.\"",
      "And regarding the allegations from judges who spoke to CBS News that they were pressured to rule a certain way, the Justice Department said, \"Although the Biden Administration did pressure Immigration Judges to rule a certain way, including to grant motions to dismiss, the Trump Administration has restored the rule of law and is ensuring that judges are adhering to the law.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday introduced new rules for the name, image and likeness and revenue-sharing deals that have shaken up college sports in recent years, seeking to rein in what the White House called an \"out-of-control, rudderless system.\"",
      "The executive order seeks to ban \"third-party, pay-for-play payments to collegiate athletes,\" while still allowing athletes to strike brand endorsement deals. It also says any revenue-sharing arrangements between universities and athletes should expand or preserve \"scholarships and collegiate athletic opportunities in women's and non-revenue sports.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's order also said schools with more than $50 million in athletic revenue cannot reduce the number of scholarship opportunities for \"non-revenue sports\" \u2014 typically sports other than football and basketball. Schools that draw more than $125 million are directed to increase their non-revenue scholarships in the coming academic year.",
      "The president also directed the National Labor Relations Board to work on \"clarifying the status of collegiate athletes\" \u2014 likely referring to moves by some college athletes to be deemed university employees and form labor unions.",
      "It's not clear how the order will be enforced. Mr. Trump tells top administration officials to \"develop a plan\" within 30 days to advance the order using \"all available and appropriate regulatory, enforcement, and litigation mechanisms.\" It floated decisions about federal funding, Title IX enforcement and work with Congress.",
      "CBS News was first to report on Mr. Trump's plan to sign a college sports-focused executive order last week.",
      "In recent years, collegiate sports have been reshaped by drastic policy changes that allow student-athletes to make millions of dollars while still in school.",
      "The NCAA in 2021 permitted athletes to earn money for the use of their name, image and likeness, or NIL. Since then, some big-name student-athletes have scored the types of lucrative brand endorsement deals that were once more closely associated with professional athletes.",
      "Rules restricting schools from directly paying athletes have also been loosened. A legal settlement involving the NCAA earlier this year allowed schools to start sharing revenue with athletes for the first time, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the NCAA's attempts to limit some benefits to athletes violated antitrust law.",
      "The changes mark a stark departure from college sports' previous operating model, in which athletes were thought of as amateurs and were paid in college scholarships. That system faced stiff criticism from many student-athletes, who viewed it as unfair to block them from being compensated even as their work, in some cases, brought in millions of dollars for their schools.",
      "But the new landscape has also drawn fears about whether smaller colleges will struggle to compete with their larger peers' checkbooks, and whether sports that don't generate much revenue for colleges will face more pressure. And fans of certain schools have formed so-called NIL collectives that draw in donations and offer endorsement deals to players, an arrangement some critics have called a \"pay-to-play scheme.\"",
      "\"Absent guardrails to stop the madness and ensure a reasonable, balanced use of resources across collegiate athletic programs that preserves their educational and developmental benefits, many college sports will soon cease to exist,\" Mr. Trump's executive order signed Thursday states.",
      "Meanwhile, most states have passed their own laws regulating NIL, but the federal government doesn't have a uniform standard. This week, a House committee advanced the SCORE Act, which would set national NIL rules. But there's concern that the bill\u00a0doesn't do enough to protect athletes' interests.",
      "The NCAA said in a statement after Thursday's executive order that it \"appreciates the Trump Administration's focus on the life-changing opportunities college sports provides millions of young people.\"",
      "\"The NCAA is making positive changes for student-athletes and confronting many challenges facing college sports by mandating health and wellness benefits and guaranteeing scholarships, but there are some threats to college sports that federal legislation can effectively address and the Association is advocating with student-athletes and their schools for a bipartisan solution with Congress and the Administration,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement.",

      "\"Justice demands courage. For the first time, the Department of Justice is reaching out to Ghislaine Maxwell to ask: what do you know?\" Blanche wrote on social media Tuesday. He said he contacted Maxwell's lawyers at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. \"I intend to meet with her soon. No one is above the law \u2014 and no lead is off-limits,\" Blanche wrote. Markus then confirmed that Maxwell's legal team was in discussions with the government.",
      "Pressure has been building on President Trump and his administration over Epstein's case after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo earlier this month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed he died by suicide in 2019, shortly after he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The memo also concluded that there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they would not release any further information about Epstein's case.",

      "Some of the administration's top officials, including Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, had suggested before Mr. Trump returned to the White House that Democrats were hiding information about Epstein and his alleged list of clients.",
      "In an effort to quell the backlash, the Justice Department asked federal judges in New York who handled Epstein and Maxwell's cases to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving the two.",
      "Earlier this week, judges overseeing the requests each ordered the Justice Department to submit additional filings to the court about its efforts to unseal the grand jury records. The judges gave the defendants \u2014 in Epstein's case, his representative \u2014 and victims until Aug. 5 to lay out their positions on the proposed disclosure.",
      "It will be up to the judges to decide whether the grand jury material can be disclosed. If they grant the requests, the information will likely be heavily redacted, and it is likely to be weeks or months before the transcripts are unsealed.",
      "In addition to facing backlash from some of his allies, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have pushed to make material related to Epstein public.",
      "A House panel voted Wednesday to subpoena the Justice Department for files related to the federal probe into Epstein. The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed Maxwell to sit for a deposition next month at the federal detention center in Tallahassee.",
      "Mr. Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein moved in the same social circles in Florida and New York from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said in 2019, following Epstein's arrest, that they hadn't spoken in 15 years.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Trump signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein for his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" CBS News has not independently seen or verified the letter. The president has denied that he wrote the letter, calling it \"fake,\" and sued the Journal and its owners for defamation. He is seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "The Journal reported Wednesday that when Justice Department officials reviewed documents related to Epstein earlier this year, they learned Mr. Trump's name appeared multiple times. Bondi and her deputy told the president at a White House meeting in May that his name was in the so-called Epstein files, as were those of other public figures, according to the Journal.

My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety.\"",
      "The executive order the president also asks Bondi to work with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation to prioritize federal grants for states and cities that \"enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use, urban camping and loitering,\" the White House said.

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told CBS News he's \"absolutely convinced\" Republicans will expand their narrow margin in the House in next year's midterms.",
      "\"I am very bullish on election night '26. I'm absolutely convinced we're going to grow the House majority,\" Johnson told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on Wednesday. \"It's not groundless optimism. It's going to be the result of a lot of hard work.\"",
      "Historically, the president's party almost always loses ground in the midterms right after a presidential race. The party that controls the White House has only managed to improve its edge in the House in a midterm election twice in the last 80 years, in 1998 and 2002. That trend is typically driven by backlash against the incumbent president \u2014 and over the last six months, President Trump's approval rating has slid from 53% to 42%, according to CBS News polling.",
      "But Johnson said he believes his party has opportunities to go on offense, pointing to the 13 House Democrats who represent districts that Mr. Trump won in 2024, versus three Republicans whose districts went for former Vice President Kamala Harris. He also noted demographic shifts in the 2024 race, which saw Mr. Trump make gains with Black and Latino voters.",
      "\"I like those odds,\" Johnson said.",
      "Johnson also said a controversial plan by Texas Republicans to redraw the state's congressional districts \"probably inures to our benefit,\" though he also said, \"the jury's still out on that one\" and \"we're still awaiting the outcome.\" Johnson told CBS News on Wednesday the state's Republican Gov. Greg Abbott will \"need to follow the law\" and \"be fair.\"",
      "Johnson predicts \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" will serve as economic \"jet fuel\"",
      "Johnson predicted voters will \"feel the benefits\" of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The legislation extends trillions of dollars' worth of tax cuts, appropriates new funding for border security, and adds or expands work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "Some 61% of U.S. adults disapprove of the law, according to a CBS News poll released Sunday. Some 47% of Americans believe it will hurt them and their families, versus 28% who say it won't have much of an effect on their families and only 25% who say it will help them.",
      "\"I'm not surprised by those numbers, because they've gotten a steady diet of misinformation by most of the mainstream media and the Democrats,\" Johnson told CBS News.",
      "He predicted that the bill will serve as \"jet fuel\" for the economy, and pointed to an estimate by House Republicans that its tax provisions could deliver as much as $13,300 in extra take-home pay to the typical family.",
      "The White House's Council of Economic Advisers said in a report that a family with two children could see between $7,800 and $13,300 in additional take-home pay \"in the long run\" as a result of the bill.",
      "The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found Americans from most income levels will see tax savings from the law next year, averaging $2,900 per household, though higher-income people will see a bigger impact. The group said $6 of every $10 in tax breaks will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes of about $217,000 or more.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to give it the green light to cancel hundreds of grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health because they were tied to issues like gender identity and diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the high court to halt a lower court decision that ordered the NIH to reinstate the grants and required the Trump administration to continue paying out roughly $783 million in awards. The administration had decided that the grants did not align with its policy objectives.",
      "The grants were canceled in response to executive orders signed by Mr. Trump soon after he returned to the White House that directed federal agencies to terminate awards and contracts that were related to diversity, equity and inclusion \u2014 or DEI \u2014 and gender identity research activities and programs.",
      "NIH began ending the grants that it said did not match the administration's policy priorities in February,\u00a0 and in April, 16 states, as well as research and advocacy groups, a union and researchers filed lawsuits challenging the cancellations.",

      "The district court last month ruled in favor of the research entities after holding a bench trial in the cases, finding that NIH engaged in \"no reasoned decision-making\" in the rollout of the grant terminations. U.S. District Judge William Young, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, tossed out the challenged directives.",
      "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause the district court's decision, which it declined to do.",
      "In the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Sauer said its request for relief gives it a chance to \"stop errant district courts from continuing to disregard\" its decisions.",
      "Sauer pointed to an April order from the Supreme Court that cleared the way for the Department of Education to cancel millions of dollars in grants that it said funded programs that involve DEI initiatives. The high court said in that order that the Trump administration was likely to succeed in showing that the federal district court that oversaw that case lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under a federal law governing the agency rulemaking process.",

      "Those findings have not satisfied some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have called on the Justice Department to release all the information on the Epstein case. A handful of House Republicans joined with Democrats on Wednesday to vote on subpoenaing the Justice Department for some of its files on Epstein.",

Ralph Norman of South Carolina calls for the release of much of the same documentation, but would carry no legal weight if the Trump administration does not follow through.",

Wyden said it shows more than 4,700 in potentially suspicious wire transfers adding up to nearly $1.1 billion flowing in and out of just one of Epstein's bank accounts and hundreds of millions through other accounts.",
      "Wyden sent a letter this week to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging the Justice Department to further investigate Epstein's financial transactions and whether several big banks turned a blind eye to suspicious transfers. The senator's office said the attorney general has not yet responded. The Justice Department has not yet responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"The Treasury Department's Epstein file contains significant information on the sources of funding behind Epstein's sex trafficking activities,\" Wyden wrote. \"Epstein clearly had access to enormous financing to operate his sex trafficking network, and the details on how he got the cash to pay for it are sitting in a Treasury Department filing cabinet.\"",
      "Seeking testimony from Ghislaine Maxwell",

      "The Legislature has been under Republican control since 2011, and some Democrats had hoped that Evers, 73, would run for a third term to give him a chance to potentially work with a Democratic-controlled one.",
      "In a video announcing his decision, Evers said he was \"damn proud\" of working 50 years in public service. But he said it was time to focus on his family.",
      "\"For five decades, my family has sacrificed to give me the gift of service,\" Evers said. \"They're my world and I owe it to them to focus on doing all the things we enjoy and love doing together.\"",
      "Evers has drawn the ire of President Trump's administration, and his tenure has been marked by his often contentious relationship with the Legislature.",
      "Before Evers even took office, Republicans convened a lame-duck session to pass a package of laws to weaken his power.",
      "Evers angered Republicans during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when he ordered schools and nonessential businesses to close, issued a statewide mask mandate and tried, unsuccessfully, to delay the state's April presidential primary.",
      "Republicans broke with tradition to reject 21 Evers appointees. They also blocked many of his proposals, including expanding Medicare, legalizing marijuana and spending more on child care, K-12 schools and higher education.",

      "But Evers did work with Republicans to pass the most recent state budget, which included $1.5 billion in tax cuts prioritized by the GOP and more funding for both K-12 special education and the University of Wisconsin. Evers also worked with Republicans to keep the Brewers in Milwaukee and funnel more money to local governments.",
      "Evers pushed for the redrawing of Wisconsin's legislative boundary lines, which the state Supreme Court ordered after liberal justices gained a majority in 2023.",
      "The maps drawn by Republicans, which had been in place for more than a decade, were widely regarded as among the most gerrymandered in the country. The new maps drawn by Evers are more favorable to Democrats and helped them pick up seats in last November's election. Democrats are optimistic that they can win control of at least one legislative chamber next year.",
      "Evers waited until after he signed the state budget before making his retirement announcement.",
      "\"I promised you when I ran for this office that I'd always work to do the right thing, that I'd always give it to you straight, and that I'd always try to be a governor for all of Wisconsin. And I work every day to keep those promises. That'll never change,\" he said.",

Sarah Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley.",
      "Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and suburban Milwaukee businessman Bill Berrien are running as Republicans. Others, including U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, are considering it.",
      "The last open race for governor was in 2010, when Democratic incumbent Jim Doyle, similar to Evers, opted not to seek a third term. Republican Scott Walker won that year and served two terms before Evers defeated him in 2018.",
      "The only Wisconsin governor to be elected to a third four-year term was Republican Tommy Thompson, who served from 1986 to 2001. He resigned midway through his fourth term.",
      "Evers won the gubernatorial race in 2018 by little more than a percentage point. In 2022, he fended off a challenge from Trump-endorsed Tim Michels.",
      "Before being elected governor, Evers worked for 10 years as state superintendent of education after a career as a teacher and school administrator.",
      "Evers positioned himself as a folksy governor who would sprinkle the occasional mild swear word into his comments and other Midwestern colloquialisms such as \"holy mackerel\" and \"folks.\" His mild-mannered demeanor stood in stark contrast to Trump and other political firebrands.",
      "\"I think he is the most quintessential Wisconsin politician I've ever seen,\" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who has been in elected office since 1991.",

      "\"I could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts; perhaps you have the power to trade me away,\" Routh wrote.",
      "On Wednesday, the federal public defender's office filed a motion for termination of appointment of counsel, saying \"the attorney-client relationship is irreconcilably broken.\" Attorneys said Routh refused to meet with them for a scheduled in-person meeting Tuesday morning at the federal detention center in Miami. They said Routh has refused six attempts to meet with their team.",
      "\"It is clear that Mr. Routh wishes to represent himself, and he is within his Constitutional rights to make such a demand,\" the motion said.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Routh was armed with an AK-47-style rifle and was allegedly 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump when the Secret Service agent spotted his rifle in the tree line, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.",
      "The incident followed another attempted assassination, last July, which took place at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Mr.\u00a0 Trump and two others were injured, and one man, Corey Comperatore, was killed when a gunman, Thomas Crooks, fired shots. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service sniper.",

      "The Social Security Administration said it will continue issuing paper checks to the retirement program's beneficiaries, backing away from a previously announced plan to switch all payments to electronic deposits after Sept. 30.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration told CBS MoneyWatch it would continue issuing paper checks for beneficiaries, including recipients of retirement and disability benefits, who have no other means of getting\u00a0payments. But the program will also emphasize the advantages of electronic transfers to its roughly 70 million beneficiaries in an effort to encourage check recipients to switch, a Social Security spokesperson added.",
      "The about-face comes after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0on July 14 that it would phase out paper checks beginning in October, citing the advantages of electronic deposits including faster payment processing and enhanced security. Eliminating paper also saves the federal government money, with checks costing 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer, the agency said at the time.",
      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",
      "She added that Bisignano \"made a commitment that no one will be left behind and that people who have access to paper checks will get access to paper checks.\"",
      "Millions of people in the U.S. are \"unbanked,\" meaning they lack traditional bank accounts, often because they believe they don't earn enough to qualify for an account or are worried about costs or other issues, according to Bankrate. Typically, these people rely on check-cashing services or other non-bank financial companies, such as PayPal or Venmo, rather than banks.",
      "About one out of every five households headed by someone over the age of 65 is unbanked or underbanked, according to the AARP. People who are underbanked may have a bank account but still primarily rely on alternative banking services, like check cashing establishments, to handle their money.",
      "Focus on customer service",
      "Warren also said she addressed other issues with Bisignano, including concerns that a major workforce reduction at the Social Security Administration this year could affect customer service.",
      "The senator said Bisignano agreed to her request that the agency's inspector general conduct an independent audit to assess the state of customer service at SSA, such as call wait times and how many Social Security recipients are able to reach a human employee when they call for help.",
      "\"More accurate data is absolutely essential to oversight, to holding the Social Security Administration accountable to the job they are required to do,\" Warren said.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration said\u00a0customer service is improving, noting that the agency has reduced its phone response time to an average of 18 minutes in 2025, down from 30 minutes in 2024.",
      "\"Commissioner Bisignano had a productive meeting with Senator Warren where he presented improved customer service metrics that are currently being realized on the phone, in field offices and online,\" a Social Security Administration spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Senator Warren reacted positively to many of the indicators, specifically lower phone and field office wait times, the reduction of the disability claims backlog by 25% and the speed at which the SSFA payments were completed \u2014 give months ahead of schedule.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Pentagon's internal watchdog has obtained evidence that encrypted messages sent from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Signal account included details from a classified email, according to two senior American officials with knowledge of the matter.",
      "The chat messages listed out information on a planned U.S. bombing operation in Yemen in March, and were sent to several Trump administration officials in a Signal group \u2014 which became public when a reporter was inadvertently added to the chat. At the time, administration officials denied that any classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "Key information in the messages was derived from a classified email marked \"SECRET//NOFORN,\" said the two officials, who both requested anonymity to speak about an ongoing investigation into top Trump administration officials.",
      "The \"SECRET\" designation means that the information was classified and the disclosure of this information could potentially cause serious damage to national security, potentially jeopardizing the safety of service members. The \"NOFORN\" label means the information can only be disseminated to U.S. agencies and individuals, excluding foreign nationals and even close U.S. allies.",
      "The Washington Post first reported about the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General receiving the evidence on Wednesday.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Wednesday, the Inspector General's office said it would not comment about ongoing oversight projects. In April, the Defense Department IG announced it would evaluate the Defense Secretary's use of commercial messaging applications for official business and whether his office complied with classification and records retention requirements.",
      "The Pentagon's chief spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement, \"The Department stands behind its previous statements: no classified information was shared via Signal.\" He also called reporting on the secretary's use of the Signal app \"so old and worn out, it's starting to resemble Joe Biden's mental state.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have faced staunch scrutiny since the existence of the Signal chat messages was first reported by The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was accidentally added to the Signal chat group by then-National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Trump officials in the Signal chat group have repeatedly denied that classified information was shared in the group.",
      "But the two U.S. officials with knowledge of the evidence received by the Pentagon's watchdog office told CBS News on Wednesday that the information Hegseth posted in the encrypted Signal chat group was derived from a classified email sent out by Gen. Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla to dozens of defense officials. Kurilla oversees U.S. Central Command, which is the primary Defense Department organization responsible for conducting U.S. military operations in the Middle East.",
      "The Atlantic published screenshots that it said were from the Signal chat, which appeared to show Hegseth sharing a timeline of planned attacks on Houthi rebels in Yemen. It listed the timing of two sets of F-18 launches and strikes, a set of drone strikes and some Tomahawk missile strikes.",
      "\"Just CONFIRMED w/ CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,\" one message read, according to the magazine.",
      "Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said in an April statement: \"There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story.\" He made that claim after reporting showed Hegseth also shared details in a separate Signal chat that included members of his family.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe \u2014 both of whom appeared to be members of the chat group \u2014 also told lawmakers in March that classified material wasn't shared.",
      "Ratcliffe said that Signal \"is a permissible use\" application that has been approved by the White House for use by senior officials, and the group chat was a \"mechanism for communicating between senior level officials but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications.\"",
      "The defense secretary, according to federal regulations, has the authority to declassify information, but after the messages surfaced, Hegseth didn't answer when asked by reporters whether he took that approach before sharing the information on Signal.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans,\" Hegseth told reporters in March.",
      "Signal is a free messaging app that's popular due to its high standard of encryption, which prevents people other than the senders or recipients from viewing messages.",
      "Human error remains a vulnerability for Signal and other encrypted apps, as the episode involving Hegseth demonstrated. And in February, the National Security Agency warned its staff that Russian hacking groups were using phishing messages to gain access to Signal users' accounts, allowing them to view victims' activity, according to documents obtained by CBS News earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump is due to arrive Friday for what the White House is calling a \"working visit\" to Scotland. It's expected to include a mix of both personal time, and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",
      "During his visit he's also set to meet Scotland's top official, First Minister John Swinney, who publicly backed Kamala Harris' presidential bid against Mr. Trump last year.",
      "The American leader will also meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer near the end of his trip in Scotland, and the current 25% U.S. tariffs on British steel imports could be a focus of discussion.",
      "Trump visits bring protests and security concerns",
      "Mr. Trump has Scottish roots through his mother, who was born in 1912 as Mary Anne MacLeod on the Scottish island of Lewis in the remote Outer Hebrides.",
      "But despite his ancestry, Mr. Trump can likely expect a luke-warm to cold reception on Scottish soil. Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the polices he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been\u00a0 organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",
      "The demonstrations are slated to include large banners and messages in the sand of Scotland's coastline, intended to be visible to the president as he lands",
      "A senior Scottish police official told Britain's Sky News it would be \"inappropriate\" to ignore the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump a year ago.",
      "\"There's a broad range of considerations,\" said Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond. \"It would be inappropriate for me to plan an operation and not bear in mind what has happened in other parts of the world. But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",
      "Mr. Trump will return to the U.K. for an unprecedented second official state visit on September 17, during which he is scheduled to meet with King Charles III.

      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\"Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,\" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \"I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\"",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you.\"",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to\u00a0a new study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \"digital friends,\" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are \"everywhere in teens' lives.\"",
      "Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships.",
      "\"Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,\" Steyer said. \"They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings.\"",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,\" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \"When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\"",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \"AI companion\" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\"That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\" said Nair. \"It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\"",
      "How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",
      "\"It's the new addiction,\" Nair added. \"That's how I see it.\"",

      "Can you teach an old dog new tricks? Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan set out to change aspects of her personality she didn't like by forcing herself outside of her comfort zone, and documented the progress she made in her new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change\" (Simon & Schuster/Simon Element).",
      "Among the challenges that Khazan, a lifelong introvert, set for herself: Tackling her social anxiety by enrolling in an improv class. Yes, and \u2026 how did that go?",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Susan Spencer's interview with Olga Khazan on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",
      "\"Me, But Better\" by Olga Khazan",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "summary": "Writer Olga Khazan, a lifelong introvert obsessed with work, was unhappy with who she was, and so vowed to redesign her personality by living outside her comfort zone \u2013 a journey she documented in her new book, \"Me, But Better.\"",
    "story": [
      "For years, Olga Khazan, a Virginia-based staff writer at The Atlantic, knew she had a big problem: she hated much of her own personality. \"I was constantly worried about everything,\" she said. \"Just never living in the moment. And I didn't really like doing anything fun with other people. Just wasn't my thing.\"",
      "How might she function at a party? \"I would kind of stand off to myself, and honestly, sometimes just, like, read articles on my phone or just basically not engage,\" she laughed.",
      "Not surprisingly, a lot of folks didn't want to engage with Khazan, either. \"One person called me a pressure addict, that I was sort of obsessed with working, and just doing as much work as possible, and never taking a minute to appreciate life,\" she said. \"One person told me that she was kind of afraid of me when we worked together.\"",
      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched twin satellites for NASA Wednesday that will study how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field, creating constantly changing and occasionally dangerous \"space weather\" affecting satellites, electrical grids and other critical systems.",
      "The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, \"the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,\" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division.",
      "\"What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space.",
      "\"It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth.\"",
      "Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new \"polylingual\" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols.",
      "Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the \"radiation budget,\" and another that will focus on how high-energy \"killer electrons\" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere.",
      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",
      "The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols.",
      "The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs.",
      "Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space.",
      "Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites.",
      "The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator.",
      "\"The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,\" she said. \"These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction.\"",
      "The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, \"it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them.\"",
      "What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which \"could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

      "Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the \"radiation budget,\" and another that will focus on how high-energy \"killer electrons\" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere.",
      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",
      "The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols.",
      "The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs.",
      "Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space.",

Despite its small size, \"it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them.\"",
      "What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which \"could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.\"",

      "\"That is what we expect to learn more about during this pilot. Riders may experience longer wait times if women drivers are unavailable or further away. If so, they can choose to wait, reserve a ride with a woman driver for a later time, or choose a ride with any available driver that may not match their preference,\" an Uber spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "\"Around the globe, everyone is talking about artificial intelligence,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \"I find that too, 'artificial' \u2014 I can't stand it. I don't even like the name. I don't like anything that's artificial, so could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that. I don't like the name artificial anything.

      "The number of data centers is only expected to grow as technology companies \u2014 including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI \u2014 ramp up construction to meet the nation's growing energy demand stemming from the emergence of AI.",
      "In addition to investments in data centers, the new White House plan also focuses on \"expediting and modernizing programs\" for semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, and updating the nation's electric grid to support the enormous energy demands of AI supercomputing, Kratsios said.",
      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday withdrew the nomination of Alina Habba, his former defense lawyer, to serve as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, a Justice Department official confirmed, which clears the way for her to serve as the U.S. attorney in the state in an acting capacity.",
      "Mr. Trump's move came after a federal district court set off a leadership scramble in the U.S. attorney's office when it declined to keep Habba in the role of U.S. attorney and instead installed Desiree Leigh Grace as the state's top federal prosecutor.",
      "Grace, who was Habba's deputy, was selected by the judges on the U.S. district court in New Jersey to serve as the U.S. attorney for the state as Habba's 120-day term in the post wound down. But shortly after, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Grace had been removed as first assistant U.S. attorney, and she excoriated the judges for tapping Grace, instead of letting Habba stay in the role.",
      "\"This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges \u2014 especially when they threaten the president's core Article II powers,\" Bondi wrote on social media.",
      "The attorney general's post raised questions about who would be the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey as the 120-day clock on Habba's interim term expires. A court order signed by Chief Judge Renee Bumb said Grace's appointment was effective Tuesday or \"upon the expiration of 120 days after\" Habba's appointment by Bondi.",
      "But Habba said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X, \"I am now the Acting United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey\" and indicated she would fight for the job. The Justice Department official confirmed that Mr. Trump pulled Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney, which avoids a provision of federal law that restricts\u00a0a person\u00a0from serving as an acting officer if the president has submitted their nomination to the Senate. That law limits her time as acting U.S. attorney to 210 days from when the vacancy occurred.",
      "Mr. Trump announced on March 24 that he had tapped Habba to serve as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which would put the expiration of her term at July 22. But Todd Blanche, deputy attorney general, has said her tenure as interim U.S. attorney ends Friday.",
      "Habba has the Justice Department leaders behind her, and they've accused New Jersey judges of playing politics with their decision not to keep Habba in the post.",
      "Mr. Trump had nominated Habba for the role of U.S. attorney, but New Jersey's two home-state senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, oppose her.",
      "\"President Trump continues to have full confidence in Alina Habba and her commitment to serve the people of New Jersey,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Habba was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in several civil cases brought against him in New York, and she joined the White House as a counselor to the president after Mr. Trump won a second term. The president announced in March that he had tapped Habba to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in her home state of New Jersey. Federal law limited her time as interim U.S. attorney to 120 days.",
      "Habba deserves the job, according to Armen Morian, who worked alongside Habba in a 2023 New York civil case in which Mr. Trump, his company and top executives were found liable for fraud.",
      "\"I think she's eminently qualified to be U.S. attorney, and I think she's doing a fine job of it,\" Morian said.",
      "Morian hit back at Habba's critics who questioned her suitability for the job, having never previously been a prosecutor.",
      "\"President Trump is a very unconventional figure, and he forces us, I think, to reconsider a lot of the assumptions we make. Sometimes it's very useful to put somebody into an office who has shown to you that she has sufficient judgment and will do well in the position,\" Morian said.",
      "But the state's two senators, Booker and Kim, opposed her nomination. Under the Senate Judiciary Committee's \"blue slip\" policy, a nomination for U.S. attorney or to a federal district court will not move forward unless both home-state senators return positive blue slips.",
      "With the 120-day deadline on Habba's term approaching, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. district court in New Jersey invoked their power under federal law and voted to replace Habba with Grace, her deputy.",
      "Can judges even appoint the U.S. attorney?",
      "Yes. A federal statute governing U.S. attorney vacancies specifies that if the attorney general's appointment of a U.S. attorney expires after 120 days, the district court can name a U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "The law requires an order of appointment by the court to be filed with the clerk of the court.",
      "\"The reason why you have this 120-day deadline followed by judicial appointments was so that the president is incentivized to get someone confirmed because after 120 days, you lose the authority within the executive branch to control who is the U.S. attorney,\" Thomas Barry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "While rare, courts have exercised this power before.",
      "The judges on the U.S. district court in New Mexico selected Gregory Fouratt to serve as the top federal prosecutor in the state in January 2008, and in 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term, the district court in New Jersey appointed Craig Carpenito the state's U.S. attorney as his 120-day term was set to run out. Also that year, the U.S. district court in Manhattan tapped Geoffrey Berman to serve as the district's top federal prosecutor.",
      "But Berman's exit in June 2020 was rocked by confusion when then-Attorney General Bill Barr announced that Berman would be \"stepping down.\" Berman, however, said he had not resigned and had no intention of doing so. Barr then informed Berman that Mr. Trump had removed him from the post.",
      "Does Bondi have the power to remove a court-appointed U.S. attorney?",
      "It doesn't seem so. In a 1979 opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which is not binding, then-Assistant Attorney General John Harmon explained that \"the president is responsible for the conduct of a U.S. Attorney's Office and therefore must have the power to remove one he believes is an unsuitable incumbent, regardless of who appointed him.\"",
      "Harmon also said that when it comes to whether the attorney general has the authority to terminate a court-appointed U.S. attorney, \"We answer this questions [sic] in the negative.\" He said federal law regarding the removal of U.S. attorneys constitutes \"the specific exercise of legislative power under Article II, section 2, clause 2, vesting in the president the power of removing a court-appointed U.S. attorney.\"",
      "In a social media post, Blanche wrote that Grace had been ousted \"pursuant to the president's authority.\"",
      "\"This backroom vote will not override the authority of the Chief Executive,\" he wrote.",
      "Berry said there have been very few, if any, judicial decisions, about the removal of interim U.S. attorneys, especially if the attorney general disagrees with the court's appointment.",
      "Habba's appointment as acting U.S. attorney",
      "Until Thursday \u2014 because Mr. Trump had nominated her to serve as New Jersey's chief federal prosecutor \u2014 Habba did not appear to be eligible to serve as acting U.S. attorney in the state.",
      "The situation involving Habba and the U.S. attorney position in New Jersey potentially involved the interactions of two different federal laws: the statute governing U.S. attorney vacancies, which gives district courts the power to name someone to that role temporarily; and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 27-year-old law that limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Mr. Trump used the law, also known as the Vacancies Act, during his first term to install a number of \"acting\" leaders across the executive branch.",
      "Enacted in 1998, the Vacancies Act sets out three categories of federal workers who can move into a position covered by the law: the \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant office; another administration official who has been confirmed by the Senate; and an agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy occurred and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale.",
      "Grace, who the New Jersey judges selected to succeed Habba, was the first assistant.",
      "But the law prohibits a person from serving as an acting officer if the president has submitted their nomination to the Senate. The upper chamber received Habba's nomination from Mr. Trump on June 30. His withdrawal of her nomination now enables Habba to serve as acting U.S. attorney, as she resigned from the interim post \u2014 the role the district judges declined to keep her in \u2014 and was then appointed first assistant U.S. attorney by Bondi. Habba then could become acting U.S. attorney because the position is unfilled.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to have used the Vacancies Act to put at least one acting attorney general in place \u2014 John Sarcone who is currently leading the U.S. Attorney's Office in Albany.",
      "Bondi announced in early March that Sarcone had been appointed the interim top federal prosecutor for the Northern District of New York, but earlier this month, the U.S. district court there declined to tap him for U.S. attorney. Bondi instead named him \"special attorney to the attorney general,\" which effectively gives him the power of a U.S. attorney. Sarcone was named first assistant U.S. attorney as well, effectively leaving him in charge of the office.",
      "Berry said there is a loophole in the Vacancies Act that allows a lower-ranking official who does not require Senate confirmation to perform the duties of a senior leader when that role is vacant, which could be used to Habba's benefit.",
      "\"Subdelegation is so easy to do throughout the executive branch,\" he said. \"This exact same maneuver is done all the time for all sorts of offices.\"",
      "What happens to Grace?",
      "In a post Wednesday on LinkedIn, Grace indicated she is no longer the No. 2 in the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, but signaled she was prepared to follow the judges' order that names her the interim U.S. attorney, even though Bondi fired her from her post as the first assistant.",
      "\"It will forever be the greatest honor that they selected me on merit, and I'm prepared to follow that Order and begin to serve in accordance with the law,\" Grace wrote.",
      "The dozens of comments beneath Grace's LinkedIn post highlight her deep ties in the state, and high regard among New Jersey law enforcement.",
      "Minneapolis Chief of Police Brian O'Hara, who previously was Newark, New Jersey's Safety Director, congratulated Grace.",
      "\"Desiree Grace Anyone who knows you knows the heart, integrity, and commitment you bring to the job. You have definitely made a difference,\" O'Hara wrote.",

    "summary": "Maui lawmakers passed legislation aimed at eliminating a large percentage of the Hawaiian island's vacation rentals to address a housing shortage exacerbated by last year's Lahaina wildfire.",
    "story": [
      "Honolulu \u2014 Lawmakers on Maui passed legislation Thursday aimed at eliminating a large percentage of the Hawaiian island's vacation rentals to address a housing shortage exacerbated by the wildfire that destroyed most of Lahaina in August 2023.",
      "It's the latest action by a top global tourist destination to push back against the infiltration of vacationers into residential neighborhoods and tourism overwhelming their communities. In May, Spain ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform for having violated rules. Last month, thousands of protesters in European cities like Barcelona and Venice, Italy, marched against the ills of overtourism.",
      "The Maui County Council's housing committee voted 6-3 to pass the bill, which would close a loophole that has allowed owners of condos in apartment zones to rent their units for days or weeks at a time instead of a minimum of 180 days. The mandate would take effect in the West Maui district that includes Lahaina in 2028. The rest of the county would have until 2030 to comply.",
      "The full council still needs to vote on the bill, but the committee's result is a strong indication of the final outcome because all nine council members sit on the housing panel. The mayor is expected to sign the bill, which he proposed.",
      "\"Bill 9 is a critical first step in restoring our commitment to prioritize housing for local residents - and securing a future where our keiki can live, grow, and thrive in the place they call home,\" Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said in a statement, using the Hawaiian word for children.",
      "\"We were seeing a dire housing crisis before the fire and then we lost 2,200 structures in the fire, and a lot of that was our local housing for our people,\" Jordan Ruidas of the group Lahaina Strong told CBS Honolulu affiliate KGMB-TV. The group had been pushing hard for the measure.",
      "Vacation rentals currently account for 21% of all housing in the county, which has a population of about 165,000 people.",
      "An analysis by University of Hawaii economists predicted the measure would add 6,127 units to Maui's long-term housing stock, increasing supply by 13%.",
      "Opponents questioned whether local residents could afford the condos in question, noting that many of the buildings they are in are aging and their units come with high mortgages, insurance payments, maintenance and special assessment costs.",
      "Alicia Humiston said her condo is in a hotel zone so it won't be affected. But she predicted the measure will hurt housekeepers, plumbers, electricians and other small business owners who help maintain vacation rentals.",
      "\"It's not what's best for the the community,\" said Humiston, who is president of the Rentals by Owner Awareness Association.",
      "Bissen proposed the legislation last year after wildfire survivors and activists camped out on a beach popular with tourists to demand change.",
      "Projected impact of the measure",
      "The University of Hawaii study said only about 600 new housing units are built in the county each year so converting the vacation rentals would be equivalent to a decade's worth of new housing development. Condo prices would drop 20-40%, the study estimated.",
      "The report also predicted one-quarter of Maui County's visitor accommodations would vanish and visitor spending would sink 15%. It estimated gross domestic product would contract by 4%.",
      "The mayor said such economic analysis failed to tell a full story, noting families are torn apart when high housing costs drive out relatives and that cultural knowledge disappears when generations leave Maui.",
      "The mayor told the council the bill was one part of a broader housing strategy that would include building new housing, investing in infrastructure and stopping illegally operated vacation rentals. He said there were limits to how much new housing could be built because of constraints on water supplies and sewer infrastructure.",
      "Tourism would continue on Maui but must do so in a way \"that doesn't hollow out our neighborhoods,\" the mayor said.",
      "The mayor's staff told council members visitor spending would decline with the measure but most of the drop would be on lodging. Because 94% of those who own vacation rentals in apartment zones don't live on Maui, they said much of this income already flows off-island. They predicted the county budget could withstand an estimated $61 million decline in annual tax revenue resulting from the measure.",
      "The Lahaina wildfire tore through the historic town,\u00a0killing at least 115 people, and leaving nothing but rubble and ash for blocks. Many residents whose homes burned to the ground received solicitations from off-island real estate investors\u00a0to scoop up their land.",

    "summary": "Byron Black, who has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Aug. 5.",
    "story": [
      "A judge's order to take a Tennessee death row inmate to the hospital on the morning of his execution so doctors can deactivate his heart-regulating implant would cause \"chaos,\" state attorneys said in an appeal.",
      "The argument was one of several in a filing Wednesday that seeks to overturn an order to deactivate Byron Black's implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, including when and where to do it. Black is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Aug. 5 at 10 a.m.",
      "His attorneys say his heart device would continuously shock him in an attempt to restore his heart's normal rhythm during the execution, but the state disputes that and argues that even if shocks were triggered, that Black wouldn't feel them.",
      "Officials said they would need to transfer Black through Nashville the morning of his execution to comply with a judge's order, and that the trip would create security risks, including from protestors. It's about 7 miles from Riverbend Maximum Security Institution to Nashville General Hospital.",
      "Kelley Henry, Black's attorney, said the state presented \"zero evidence of security risk\" and said state officials were the ones who made the proposed time and place of the hospital procedure public.",
      "The Tennessee Supreme Court is taking up the appeal and fast-tracking it.",
      "A judge sided with Black's attorneys last week, initially ruling that the state must turn off the heart device in the minutes just before the execution.",
      "Black is set to die by a single dose of the barbiturate pentobarbital.",
      "His cardioverter-defibrillator is a small, battery-powered electronic instrument that is surgically implanted in someone's chest, usually near the left collarbone. It can be deactivated with a handheld machine, but the state says Black's doctors have refused to come to the prison to do it.",
      "The state asked the judge to either overturn the order about the deactivation or allow the Tennessee Department of Correction to take Black to the hospital for it the day before his execution. After a hearing Tuesday, the judge adjusted his order to say the state needs to take Black to the hospital the morning of his execution rather than deactivating the device minutes before it.",
      "Henry told the judge the deactivation needs to happen immediately before the execution so authorities don't risk accidentally killing Black just before a possible reprieve.",
      "In its appeal, state has repeated arguments that the lower-court judge lacked authority to order the device disabled.",
      "The state is now saying that the order to transport Black to the hospital the morning of the execution presents a \"very real risk of danger to TDOC personnel, hospital patients/staff, the public, and even Black.\"",
      "Henry said there's \"no appreciable difference\" between transporting Black Aug. 5 or Aug. 4, which is when the state proposed taking him to the hospital after the judge ordered the deactivation. She also said there's no risk in the transportation.",
      "\"Mr. Black cannot walk,\" Henry said. \"He is a frail, 69 year old man, with a history of clear conduct. And the idea that the group of pacifists who protest executions by prayer would in some way create a ruckus during transport is simply not believable.\"",
      "Black was convicted in the 1988 shooting deaths of girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her two daughters, Latoya, 9, and Lakeisha, 6. Prosecutors said he was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work-release while serving time for shooting and wounding Clay's estranged husband.",
      "Black's motion related to his heart device came within a general challenge he and other death row inmates filed against the state's new execution protocol. The trial isn't until 2026.",
      "Black's legal team previously argued their client's cognitive disabilities mean he isn't competent for execution. Earlier this month, they sent a letter to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, urging him to grant Black clemency and asking him to commute his sentence to life in prison.",
      "\"Mr. Black, who lives with an intellectual disability, has been on death row for 25 years,\" the letter read. \"From infancy, he suffered from the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, resulting in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. As a toddler, he was exposed to toxic lead, compounding his lifelong cognitive and developmental impairments.\"",

On Thursday, the DOJ charged two suspects, alleging they are Dominican Republic nationals in the U.S. illegally. Police sources told CBS News New York the NYPD believes the suspects to be associates of the Trinitarios gang.",

      "\"The challenged provisions of New York City law reflect the City's intentional effort to obstruct the United States' enforcement of federal immigration law, by (among much else) impeding the consultation and communication between federal and local law enforcement officials that is necessary for the United States to enforce the law and keep Americans safe,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "\"New York City has released thousands of criminals on the streets to commit violent crimes against law-abiding citizens due to sanctuary city policies,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said. \"If New York City won't stand up for the safety of its citizens, we will.\"",
      "The New York Immigration Coalition called the lawsuit frivolous.",

      "\"We're going to flood the zones\"",
      "\"I made a statement the other day about New York. We're going to flood the zones. The sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don't want, more agents in the communities and more worksite enforcement. Why is that? Because they won't let one agent arrest one bad guy in a jail. They're going to release a public safety threat back in the community. Now, I've got to send the whole team to go find that person. So you know, we're going to find the bad guy whether they help us or not,\" Homan said.",
      "City Hall responded with the following statement:",
      "\"The job of a mayor is to protect the safety of every single person in their city -- and that's exactly what Mayor Adams has worked to do every day for nearly four years. Keeping New Yorkers safe also means making sure they feel safe, and Mayor Adams has been clear: no one should be afraid to dial 911, send their kids to school, or go to the hospital, and no New Yorker should feel forced to hide in the shadows. That's why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council -- but he has also been clear they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and has urged the Council to re-examine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer. So far, the Council has refused. We will review the lawsuit,\" a spokesperson for Mayor Adams said.",

      "\"The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,\" Hogan said. \"People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.\"",
      "Hogan first became champion in what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, and pro wrestling took off from there. His popularity helped lead to the creation of the annual WrestleMania event in 1985, when he teamed up with Mr. T to beat \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the main event.",
      "He slammed and beat Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III in 1987, and the WWF gained momentum. His feud with the late \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage \u2014 perhaps his greatest rival \u2014 carried pro wrestling even further.",
      "Hogan was a central figure in what is known as the Monday Night Wars. The WWE and World Championship Wrestling were battling for ratings supremacy in 1996. Hogan tilted things in WCW's favor with the birth of the Hollywood Hogan character and the formation of the New World Order, a villainous stable that put WCW ahead in the ratings.",
      "He returned to the WWE in 2002 and became a champion again. His match with The Rock at WrestleMania X8, a loss during which fans cheered for his \"bad guy\" character, was seen as a passing of the torch.",
      "Hogan was perhaps as well known for his larger-than-life personality as he was his in-ring exploits. He was beloved for his \"promos\" \u2014 hype sessions he used to draw fans into matches. He often would play off his interviewer, \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund, starting his interviews off with, \"Well, lemme tell ya something, Mean Gene!\"",
      "In 2016, a Florida jury awarded Hogan $115 million in a lawsuit against Gawker Media and then added $25 million in punitive damages. Hogan sued after Gawker in 2012 posted a video of him having sex with his former best friend's wife. He contended the post violated his privacy.",
      "Hogan smiled and wore black throughout the three-week trial.",
      "\"Everywhere I show up, people treat me like I'm still the champ,\" he said of the support from fans.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Ghislaine Maxwell at the U.S. attorney's office in Tallahassee on Thursday to discuss convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "David Oscar Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, declined to comment \"on the substance\" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that \"there were a lot of questions and we went all day.\"",
      "\"And she answered every one of them. She never did say, 'I'm not going to answer,' never declined,\" he said. \"This is the first time that the government has asked questions, so we were thankful that the deputy attorney general came and asked her questions. It's the first time the government did it. So it was a good day.\"",
      "In a post Thursday night on X, Blanche wrote that he met with Maxwell and \"will continue my interview of her tomorrow. The Department of Justice will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time.\"",
      "Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence at a low-security federal correctional institute in Tallahassee. She was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "Blanche's meeting comes after he said earlier this week that he planned to meet with Maxwell \"in the coming days.\"",
      "\"Justice demands courage. For the first time, the Department of Justice is reaching out to Ghislaine Maxwell to ask: what do you know?\" Blanche wrote on social media Tuesday. He said he contacted Maxwell's lawyers at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. \"I intend to meet with her soon. No one is above the law \u2014 and no lead is off-limits,\" Blanche wrote. Markus then confirmed that Maxwell's legal team was in discussions with the government.",
      "Pressure has been building on President Trump and his administration over Epstein's case after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo earlier this month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed he died by suicide in 2019, shortly after he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The memo also concluded that there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they would not release any further information about Epstein's case.",
      "But the Trump administration's conclusions rankled some of his allies, who were skeptical of the Justice Department's claim that there is nothing left to divulge.",
      "Some of the administration's top officials, including Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, had suggested before Mr. Trump returned to the White House that Democrats were hiding information about Epstein and his alleged list of clients.",
      "In an effort to quell the backlash, the Justice Department asked federal judges in New York who handled Epstein and Maxwell's cases to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving the two.",
      "Earlier this week, judges overseeing the requests each ordered the Justice Department to submit additional filings to the court about its efforts to unseal the grand jury records. The judges gave the defendants \u2014 in Epstein's case, his representative \u2014 and victims until Aug. 5 to lay out their positions on the proposed disclosure.",
      "It will be up to the judges to decide whether the grand jury material can be disclosed. If they grant the requests, the information will likely be heavily redacted, and it is likely to be weeks or months before the transcripts are unsealed.",
      "In addition to facing backlash from some of his allies, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have pushed to make material related to Epstein public.",
      "A House panel voted Wednesday to subpoena the Justice Department for files related to the federal probe into Epstein. The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed Maxwell to sit for a deposition next month at the federal detention center in Tallahassee.",
      "Mr. Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein moved in the same social circles in Florida and New York from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said in 2019, following Epstein's arrest, that they hadn't spoken in 15 years.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Trump signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein for his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" CBS News has not independently seen or verified the letter. The president has denied that he wrote the letter, calling it \"fake,\" and sued the Journal and its owners for defamation. He is seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "The Journal reported Wednesday that when Justice Department officials reviewed documents related to Epstein earlier this year, they learned Mr. Trump's name appeared multiple times. Bondi and her deputy told the president at a White House meeting in May that his name was in the so-called Epstein files, as were those of other public figures, according to the Journal. Mr. Trump being mentioned does not mean he committed any wrongdoing.",
      "White House communications director Steven Cheung said in response to the Journal's report that \"The fact is that The President kicked him out of his club for being a creep. This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Obama Russiagate scandal, which President Trump was right about.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order making it easier for cities and states to remove homeless people from the streets and get them treatment elsewhere.",
      "The president's order asks Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"reverse judicial precedents and end consent decrees that limit state and local governments' ability to commit individuals on the streets who are a risk to themselves or others,\" according to a White House fact sheet. It also commits federal funding to move people on the streets who are \"causing public disorder and that are suffering from serious mental illness or addiction\" to \"treatment centers, assisted outpatient treatment, or other facilities.\"",
      "\"Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order,\" the text of the order said. \"Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens. My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety.\"",
      "The executive order the president also asks Bondi to work with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation to prioritize federal grants for states and cities that \"enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use, urban camping and loitering,\" the White House said. The order was first reported by USA Today.",
      "\"President Trump is delivering on his commitment to Make America Safe Again and end homelessness across America,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"By removing vagrant criminals from our streets and redirecting resources toward substance abuse programs, the Trump administration will ensure that Americans feel safe in their own communities and that individuals suffering from addiction or mental health struggles are able to get the help they need.\"",
      "In March, Mr. Trump called for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser to \"clean up all of the unsightly homeless encampments in the City, specifically including the ones outside of the State Department, and near the White House.\" He added that if she was \"not capable of doing so, we will be forced to do it for her!\" He signed an executive order directing the National Park Service to clear all homeless encampments on federal lands.",
      "He also signed a\u00a0separate executive order\u00a0in March aiming to dismantle the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness.",
      "The president pledged to remove homeless individuals from the nation's streets during his campaign.",

      "The National Homelessness Law Center said the order \"does nothing to lower the cost of housing or help people make ends meet.\"",
      "\"Forced treatment is unethical, ineffective, and illegal. People need stable housing and access to healthcare. Rather, Trump's actions will force more people into homelessness, divert taxpayer money away from people in need, and make it harder for local communities to solve homelessness,\" said spokesperson Jesse Rabinowitz.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-job-postings-brookings-lightcast/",
    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the high court to halt a lower court decision that ordered the NIH to reinstate the grants and required the Trump administration to continue paying out roughly $783 million in awards. The administration had decided that the grants did not align with its policy objectives.",
      "The grants were canceled in response to executive orders signed by Mr. Trump soon after he returned to the White House that directed federal agencies to terminate awards and contracts that were related to diversity, equity and inclusion \u2014 or DEI \u2014 and gender identity research activities and programs.",
      "NIH began ending the grants that it said did not match the administration's policy priorities in February,\u00a0 and in April, 16 states, as well as research and advocacy groups, a union and researchers filed lawsuits challenging the cancellations.",
      "The plaintiffs asked the federal district court in Massachusetts to block NIH from terminating any grants and order the agency to restore any awards that had already been axed.",
      "The district court last month ruled in favor of the research entities after holding a bench trial in the cases, finding that NIH engaged in \"no reasoned decision-making\" in the rollout of the grant terminations. U.S. District Judge William Young, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, tossed out the challenged directives.",
      "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause the district court's decision, which it declined to do.",
      "In the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Sauer said its request for relief gives it a chance to \"stop errant district courts from continuing to disregard\" its decisions.",
      "Sauer pointed to an April order from the Supreme Court that cleared the way for the Department of Education to cancel millions of dollars in grants that it said funded programs that involve DEI initiatives. The high court said in that order that the Trump administration was likely to succeed in showing that the federal district court that oversaw that case lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under a federal law governing the agency rulemaking process.",
      "The solicitor general said the judicial system does not rest on a \"lower-court free-for-all where individual district judges feel free to elevate their own policy judgments over those of the Executive Branch, and their own legal judgments over those of this Court.\"",

It also concluded that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges in New York.",
      "Those findings have not satisfied some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have called on the Justice Department to release all the information on the Epstein case.

      "One of the victims, Kaylee Goncalves, told her roommates she saw a man she didn't recognize staring at her when she took her dog outside. Another time, the residents came home to find the door open, loose on its hinges. They grabbed golf clubs to arm themselves against a possible intruder.",
      "Those details were included in hundreds of documents released by police within hours of Kohberger being sentenced to life in prison Wednesday for the brutal stabbing murders of Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin early Nov. 13, 2022.",

      "Here's a look at some information from the documents:",
      "Strange happenings at house and mention of a stalker",
      "Bethany Funke was one of two roommates to survive the night of the stabbings. In interviews after the murders, she told police that about a month earlier, Goncalves had taken her dog, Murphy, outside when she saw an unknown man \"up above their house to the south,\" staring at her.",
      "It was concerning enough that Goncalves \"told everyone\" about it and called her roommates to ask if they'd be home soon, Funke said.",
      "A friend of Goncalves also told police that when they had lunch on Sept. 11, 2022, she made references to having a stalker, according to the documents.",
      "The friend \"thought Kaylee said something about receiving something in the mail. Some of the other friends at the lunch thought Kaylee also mentioned getting a strange message through Facebook messenger,\" the police report says.",
      "On Nov. 4, nine days before the attack, the roommates came home at 11 a.m. to find the door open, loose on its hinges, as the wind blew. Goncalves was away at the time. Kernodle's father fixed the door, Funke reported.",
      "On Nov. 13, police found a gruesome scene. Blood pooled on bed comforters, covered floors and was splattered on walls. One the victims, Kernodle, had extensive defensive wounds; in her room \"it was obvious an intense struggle had occurred,\" one officer wrote.",
      "Detailing the investigation's steps",
      "Tips poured in. A staff member at Walmart told police that two to three weeks earlier, a white, college-age male had come in looking for a black ski mask that would cover his face. People who saw online feeds of some of the victims at a food truck offered their thoughts about a possible perpetrator, and investigators also looked into leads about bar-goers they had seen earlier in the night or an Uber driver they frequently used, the documents show.",
      "A woman who lived nearby told police that in either August or September 2022, she and her daughter saw a man in their yard who \"looked nervous.\" She said she was almost certain it was Kohberger.",
      "Officers eventually identified Kohberger \u2014 a doctoral student in criminology at nearby Washington State University \u2014 using a DNA sample found on a knife sheath at the crime scene. Earlier this month, prosecutors revealed that DNA found on a discarded Q-tip proved to be a crucial breakthrough in the case.",
      "They tracked his movements that night with cellphone data, obtained online shopping records showing he had purchased a military-style knife, and linked him to a car that repeatedly drove by the students' house.",
      "The documents include memos memorializing the subpoenas or warrants they served seeking records and the responses to those requests. Investigators served a warrant on the dating app Tinder, looking for accounts Kohberger might have created with certain emails and which might link him to his victims.",
      "No such evidence emerged, and the motive for the killings remains a mystery.",
      "Kohberger spoke with police \u2014 briefly",
      "Kohberger was arrested at his parents' home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, about six weeks after the killings. He was taken to a state police barracks to be interviewed by officers from the Moscow police department, Idaho State Police and the FBI.",
      "They chatted about the Washington State football team, Kohberger's doctorate studies in criminal justice, his required duties to be a teaching assistant while in college, and why he wanted to become a professor.",
      "Kohberger eventually said he understood they were engaging in small talk, but he would appreciate if the officers explained what they wanted. One detective told him it was because of what had happened in Moscow. Asked if he knew what had transpired, he replied, \"Of course.\"",
      "Did he want to talk about it? \"Well, I think I would need a lawyer,\" Kohberger replied.",
      "He continued speaking, though \u2014 asking what specific questions they had and asking if his parents and dog were OK following his arrest.",
      "Kohberger finally said he would like to speak to an attorney, and police ended the interview because he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right.",
      "Police at the time said they\u00a0swabbed Bryan Kohberger's DNA\u00a0and seized a silver flashlight, four \"medical-style gloves,\" a white Arizona Jean Co.

      "Uber said it's starting a program to allow women passengers to pick female drivers or share a ride with other women, with pilots slated to begin in the next few weeks in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Detroit.",
      "In a Wednesday statement, Uber said that women customers will see an option called \"women drivers\" in the app. If the wait time for a woman driver is longer than they would like, they can pick another ride \u2014 presumably with a male driver \u2014 for a quicker pickup, the company said.",
      "\"Across the U.S., women riders and drivers have told us they want the option to be matched with other women on trips,\" Uber said in its statement.",
      "However, longer wait times could be an issue for women who want to get picked up by a female driver, given that Uber\u00a0has said\u00a0about 1 in 5 of its drivers are women. Customers can also pre-book rides with women drivers, the company said Wednesday.",
      "\"That is what we expect to learn more about during this pilot. Riders may experience longer wait times if women drivers are unavailable or further away. If so, they can choose to wait, reserve a ride with a woman driver for a later time, or choose a ride with any available driver that may not match their preference,\" an Uber spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Riders can also set a preference for women drivers in their Uber settings, which will boost the chances of being paired with a female driver, although such a match isn't guaranteed, the company said.",
      "Likewise, Uber drivers who are women can also request trips with female riders, including during peak hours when they can earn more, the company said. Women drivers can toggle the \"women rider preference\" option in their app settings to get paired with female customers, it added.",
      "Uber has offered similar programs in other countries, rolling out its \"women rider preference\" in Saudi Arabia in 2019, after women were given the right to drive in that country. \"Since then, the feature has expanded to 40 countries, completing over 100 million trips,\" the company said.",

      "The official said he was \"really surprised\" by the \"out of context statement by the U.S. envoy and the overarching attitude that reflects a preprepared, irresponsible and negative response\" by the U.S.",
      "The official stressed that Hamas was \"still involved in the ceasefire talks\" and expected the mediators and the international community to \"carry their responsibility\" to alleviate the dire circumstances in Gaza.",

      "The United Nations backed the call by the media organizations for Israel to let adequate food supplies into Gaza and allow journalists to enter and exit freely. U.N. staff in Gaza are hungry, too, deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Thursday.",
      "People are starving \"because we're just not getting in,\" he said, reiterating that obstacles imposed by Israel were inhibiting the delivery of U.N. aid.",
      "\"If this does not get better soon and more aid goes through all the various checkpoints, people will die,\" Haq said. \"We've been saying this for months, and now we're at the point where, in fact, people are dying.\"",
      "UNICEF, the U.N.'s Children's Fund, said in a statement on Thursday that 798 Palestinian civilians, including children, were killed near aid distribution sites in Gaza between May 27 and July 7 while seeking food.",
      "More than 100 people have died in Gaza from malnutrition since the war started, UNICEF said, and 80% were children. The charity said screening in the Palestinian enclave had found 6,000 children in a state of acute malnourishment in June alone, marking a 180% increase since February.",
      "\"Children in the Gaza Strip are starving to death. Severe malnutrition is spreading among children faster than aid can reach them, and the world is watching it happen,\" UNICEF Regional Director for the Mideast Edouard Beigbeder said in the group's statement.",
      "Israel says it is allowing enough aid into Gaza and it blames U.N. agencies for failing to distribute it. But those agencies say it's nearly impossible to safely deliver aid because of Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order in Gaza, with crowds of thousands swarming around food trucks as soon as they move into the territory.",
      "UNICEF said that From May 19 to July 2, an average of 30 U.N. aid trucks entered Gaza per day, compared to the average of 500 trucks per day that were entering before the wary. The charity said current food supplies in Gaza amounted to about 6% of the normal, pre-war levels.",
      "In greater numbers than ever, children hollowed up by hunger are overwhelming the Patient's Friends Hospital, the main emergency center for malnourished kids in northern Gaza.",
      "Staff at the facility said five young children who died last weekend of malnutrition marked a change: They were the first deaths seen at the center in children who had no preexisting conditions. Symptoms are getting worse, with children too weak to cry or move, said Dr. Rana Soboh, a nutritionist. In past months, most children brought in malnourished improved with treatment, despite supply shortages, but now patients stay longer and don't get better, she said.",
      "The lack of basic health care and sanitation is also enabling deadly diseases to spread in Gaza, the charity OXFAM warned on Friday.",
      "\"Water-borne diseases that are both preventable and readily treatable have increased by almost 150% inside Gaza over the past three months as Israel continues to deliberately block aid,\" the group said. \"Available multi-agency health data shows that the numbers of Palestinians presenting to health facilities with acute watery diarrhea have increased by 150 percent, bloody diarrhea by 302 percent, and acute jaundice cases by 101 percent.\"",
      "OXFAM said the figures were likely \"grossly under-reported because most of the two million people trapped by Israel's continuing siege have little access to the few healthcare facilities that have managed to keep operating.\"",

      "\"I smelled what a lot of residents in the community lived through and have to deal with,\" he said Thursday. \"I saw the degradation of the Tijuana River valley.

      "Since 2020, more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin has said.",

      "He also posted a letter he sent to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas about the decision.",

      "\"A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel \u2014 not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,\" he said.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States \"strongly rejects [Macron's] plan to recognize a Palestinian state\" at the U.N. General Assembly, writing Thursday on X: \"This reckless decision only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace. It is a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th.\"",
      "France is the biggest and most powerful European country to recognize Palestine. More than 140 countries recognize a Palestinian state, however, the U.S. is not among them.",

    "story": [
      "Bangkok\u00a0\u2014 Thai and Cambodian soldiers clashed in several areas along the countries' shared border on Thursday in a major escalation of a conflict that has left at least 12 people dead in Thailand, all but one of them civilians, according to the Thai health ministry. The two sides fired small arms, artillery and rockets, and Thailand also called in airstrikes.",
      "Thai villagers could be seen on video fleeing their homes to seek shelter as the clashes began in the morning.",
      "Fighting was ongoing in at least six areas along the border, Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Surasant Kongsiri said. The trigger for the clashes was a mine explosion along the border on Wednesday that wounded five Thai soldiers and led Bangkok to withdraw its ambassador to Cambodia and expel Cambodia's.",
      "Thailand's foreign ministry said all land border crossings with Cambodia were sealed and communities near the frontier had been evacuated. It urged all Thai nationals to leave Cambodia.",
      "The Southeast Asian neighbors have longstanding border disputes that periodically flare along their 500-mile frontier and usually result in brief confrontations that sometimes involve exchanges of gunfire. But relations have deteriorated sharply since a confrontation in May that killed a Cambodian soldier, and Thursday's clashes were far bigger in scale and intensity than usual.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Thailand noted reports \"of fighting, including rocket and artillery fire, between Cambodian and Thai forces along the border,\" and it said the Thai government was \"ordering the evacuation of certain areas.\"",
      "\"U.S. citizens living or traveling near the Thailand-Cambodia border should follow direction from Thai security services and consult local government authorities for the latest information,\" the embassy said.",
      "\"The United States is gravely concerned by reports of the escalating fighting along the Thailand-Cambodia border.  We are particularly alarmed by reports of harm to innocent civilians,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Thursday in a statement. \"We express our deepest condolences on the loss of life.  We strongly urge the immediate cessation of attacks, protection of civilians, and peaceful settlement of disputes.\"",
      "The first clash Thursday morning happened in an area near the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple along the border of Thailand's Surin province and Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province.",
      "A video from the Thai side showed people running from their homes and hiding in a concrete bunker as explosions sounded.",
      "The Thai army said its forces heard a drone before seeing six armed Cambodian soldiers moving closer to Thai military positions at the border. It said Thai soldiers tried to shout at them to defuse the situation, but the Cambodian side started to open fire.",
      "Cambodia's Defense Ministry, however, said Thailand deployed a drone first before opening fire, and that Cambodia \"acted strictly within the bounds of self-defense, responding to an unprovoked incursion by Thai troops that violated our territorial integrity.\"",
      "Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet wrote to the current president of the U.N. Security Council asking for an urgent meeting \"to stop Thailand's aggression.\"",
      "The Thai army said it later launched airstrikes on military targets in Cambodia, while the Cambodian Defense Ministry said the Thai jets dropped bombs on a road near the ancient Preah Vihear temple, which has been the site of some of the most prominent and violent past conflicts between the countries.",
      "Thailand's Foreign Ministry accused Cambodia of attacking both military and non-military sites in Thailand, including a hospital.",
      "\"The Royal Thai Government is prepared to intensify our self-defense measures if Cambodia persists in its armed attack and violations upon Thailand's sovereignty in accordance with international law and principles,\" said Nikorndej Balankura, the ministry's spokesperson.",
      "Acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said 11 people have died, including 10 civilians and one soldier. Meanwhile, 28 have been injured, four of whom were soldiers and the rest civilians.",
      "Cambodia released no details on deaths or injuries on its side.",
      "On Wednesday, Thailand withdrew its ambassador to Cambodia and expelled the Cambodian ambassador to protest the mine blast that wounded its soldiers.",
      "Thai authorities alleged the mines were newly laid along paths that both sides had agreed were supposed to be safe. They said the mines were Russian-made and not of a type employed by Thailand's military.",

      "Cambodia also downgraded diplomatic relations, recalling all Cambodian staff on Thursday from its embassy in Bangkok.",
      "The border dispute in May that resulted in the death of a Cambodian soldier has had political fallout in Thailand. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra came under fire for being too fawning in a phone call with her Cambodian counterpart when she tried to defuse the situation.

    "summary": "When the former Canadian junior hockey players were charged in early 2024\u200b, four of them played in the NHL.",
    "story": [
      "An Ontario judge acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team on Thursday in their sexual assault case, saying the complainant's allegations lacked the credibility needed to justify the charges.",
      "Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia said prosecutors could not meet the onus of proof for the charges against Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube and Callan Foote.",
      "The players' identities were made public when they were charged in early 2024. At the time, four of them played in the NHL \u2014 Dube for the Calgary Flames, Hart for the Philadelphia Flyers, and McLeod and Foote for the New Jersey Devils. Formenton had previously played for the Ottawa Senators before joining a Swiss team. All went on indefinite leave and none is on an NHL roster or has an active contract with a team in the league.",
      "All five players had pleaded not guilty to sexual assault in an encounter that took place in a London, Ontario, hotel room in the early hours of June 19, 2018. Years of speculation regarding the allegations \u2014 fueled by a lawsuit settlement, parliamentary hearings and revived investigations by the police and Hockey Canada, along with an NHL investigation \u2014 all preceded a complex trial earlier this year that included a mistrial and the dismissal of the jury, leaving the verdict to Carroccia.",
      "Carroccia explained her reasoning for the acquittals in detail over the course of five hours, highlighting the complainant's \"tendency to blame others\" for inconsistencies in her allegations. She also said the woman went to \"great lengths\" to point out that she was really drunk through the course of the night, but that is not supported by surveillance video from a bar and hotel that night and the testimony of others.",
      "McLeod was also acquitted \u2014 and pleaded not guilty \u2014 to a separate count of being a party to the offense, an unusual application of a charge that is more typically seen in murder cases.",
      "The players, who are now between the ages of 25 and 27, were in London at the time for a gala and golf tournament marking their championship victory.",
      "The woman testified in May that she was naked, drunk and scared when four of the men showed up unexpectedly in her room at the Delta Hotel London Armouries and felt the only \"safe\" option was to do what they wanted. Prosecutors argued the players did what they wanted without taking steps to ensure she was voluntarily consenting to sexual acts.",
      "\"I made the choice to dance with them and drink at the bar, I did not make the choice to have them do what they did back at the hotel,\" she testified.",
      "Defense attorneys cross-examined her for days and suggested she actively participated in or initiated sexual activity because she wanted a \"wild night.\" Two short videos of the complainant taken by McLeod the night of the encounter were played in court. In one, the woman says it was \"all consensual,\" though she told the court that wasn't how she truly felt.",
      "Protesters gathered outside a packed London courthouse on Thursday morning, holding signs that signaled support for the complainant.",
      "The Associated Press and other news organizations do not identify sexual assault accusers unless they have granted permission to do so, which she has not.",
      "The public didn't learn of the allegations for years. Police closed their initial investigation without charges in early 2019, but the complainant sued Hockey Canada in 2022. The organization settled the lawsuit amid intense scrutiny that cost it sponsors, but police reopened their investigation.",
      "The NHL launched its own investigation in 2022. Officials pledged to release the findings, though Commissioner Gary Bettman said in February that would depend on what the league can say given the legal proceedings.",

It's expected to include a mix of both personal time, and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",
      "During his visit he's also set to meet Scotland's top official, First Minister John Swinney, who publicly backed Kamala Harris' presidential bid against Mr. Trump last year.",

      "Mr. Trump has Scottish roots through his mother, who was born in 1912 as Mary Anne MacLeod on the Scottish island of Lewis in the remote Outer Hebrides.",
      "But despite his ancestry, Mr. Trump can likely expect a luke-warm to cold reception on Scottish soil. Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the polices he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been\u00a0 organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",

      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",

    "summary": "This week's U.S. trade agreement with Japan could provide a framework for a pact with the European Union, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",
      "AFP  \n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Agriculture Minister Julie Collins said Thursday that relaxing the restrictions designed to keep Australia free of mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE, would not compromise biosecurity.",
      "\"Australia stands for open and free trade \u2014 our cattle industry has significantly benefited from this,\" Collins said in a statement.",
      "Trump administration calls it a \"major trade breakthrough\"",
      "U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins responded to Australia's announcement by congratulating Mr. Trump on a \"major trade breakthrough that gives greater access to U.S. beef producers selling to Australia.\"",
      "She issued a statement under the headline: \"Make Agriculture Great Again Trade Wins.\"",
      "\"American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years,\" Rollins said. \"Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines. This is yet another example of the kind of market access the President negotiates to bring America into a new golden age of prosperity, with American agriculture leading the way.\"",
      "Australia has allowed imports of beef grown in the U.S. since 2019, but not allowed imports from the U.S. of beef sourced from Canada or Mexico because of the disease risk.",
      "The U.S. has recently introduced additional movement controls that identify and trace all cattle from Mexico and Canada to their farms of origin.

      "\"Australia bans \u2014 and they're wonderful people, and wonderful everything \u2014 but they ban American beef,\" Mr. Trump told reporters then. \"Yet we imported $3 billion of Australian beef from them just last year alone. They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",
      "Opposition lawmaker David Littleproud said he suspected the government was endangering Australia's cattle industry to appease Mr. Trump.",
      "Concerns over mad cow disease in imported cattle",
      "\"I want to see the science and it should be predicated on science. I'm suspicious of the speed at which this has been done,\" Littleproud told reporters.",
      "\"We need to give confidence to the industry, but also to you (the public): this is not just about animal welfare, this is about human welfare, this is about BSE potentially coming into this country and having a human impact, so I think it's important the government's very transparent about the science and I don't think it's even beyond the question to have an independent panel review that science to give confidence to everybody,\" he added.",
      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",
      "\"The department's undertaken a technical scientific assessment and we have to put faith in them. They've made this assessment themselves. They've said: 'We've looked at this, we've looked at the best science, this is a decision that we feel comfortable with,'\" Evans said.",
      "\"When you have a $75 billion (Australian $50 billion) industry relying on them not making this mistake, I'm sure they've been very cautious in their decision-making,\" he added.",
      "But Australian demand for U.S. beef is likely to remain low despite the eased restrictions, for reasons including a relatively weak Australian dollar.",
      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",
      "Simon Quilty, an analyst with Global Agri Trends, agreed that it was unlikely Australian consumers would soon see U.S. beef in on their grocery stores shelves.",
      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",
      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

    "story": [
      "Dewey Yopp, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer, was sent to Afghanistan in 2002 to train up a new Afghan army during the early days of the war in Afghanistan. He met Amir, his then-18-year-old Afghan translator, at the airport on his first day there, and says Amir went on to save his life four times.",
      "\"Amir dragged me, under fire, to a medevac point,\" Yopp told CBS News of one of those instances.",
      "After the U.S. withdrew from the country in 2021, Yopp scrambled to get Amir a special immigrant visa for Afghan allies. Amir asked CBS News to conceal his real name for safety reasons.",
      "\"If someone saves your life, your souls are bound together for eternity,\" Yopp said. \"He's like a son to me, really.\"",
      "Three years later, Amir's visa was approved, and he and his family were given green cards. They came to the U.S. and settled in Kentucky, reuniting with Yopp 22 years after they first met in Afghanistan.",

Despite he and his family having green cards, he still fears being sent back, since the White House has threatened to deport green card holders, too.",
      "Amir risked Taliban retaliation to help American soldiers, because work in Afghanistan at the time was scarce and the prospect of safety abroad was enticing. He told CBS News the promise that was made to him in return for risking his life was, \"Your family will go to America. This was promised with all who work with U.S.\"",
      "Amir said he went into hiding for years after his service, feeling betrayed by the U.S., until Yopp stepped in to fulfill America's pledge and helped secure him his visa. Thousands of veterans of the Afghanistan war across the country have taken it upon themselves to help their translators and other Afghan allies come safely to the U.S. and settle here. But Amir says it is not the job of veterans to fulfill the vow of protection the government previously made to them.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0has repeatedly targeted\u00a0Afghan refugees, stopping flights with Afghan allies from arriving, freezing resettlement services, putting Afghanistan on the travel ban list, and ending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Afghan refugees. Yopp says it is a \"moral injury\" to veterans to see this happen to those who helped them during the war.",
      "As part of the administration's efforts to end the TPS program, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0has claimed\u00a0that Afghanistan is now safe for Afghans to return to, a point Amir disputes.",
      "\"OK, if Afghanistan is safe, why are you saying to your citizens, 'Do not go to Afghanistan?'\" Amir said in reference to the State Department's \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for Afghanistan. \"For me, [it's] safe, but for you, [it's] not safe? I'm not sure.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 19:49:52 -0400",
    "summary": "The island nation of Vanuatu prevailed in its landmark request to legally compel countries to cut emissions and compensate places facing impacts from climate change.",
    "story": [
      "The Republic of Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation of 320,000 people, has led a growing effort since 2021 to compel the United Nations to answer one of the most crucial legal questions related to climate change: Can polluters be held legally accountable for the harm they've caused as a result of releasing large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere?",
      "The short answer is: yes. Fifteen judges who make up the International Court of Justice, located at The Hague in the Netherlands, issued a unanimous advisory opinion saying countries \"have a duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence and to use all means at their disposal to prevent activities carried out within their jurisdiction or control from causing significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment.\"",
      "The court further stated that existing environmental treaties, international human rights law, and participation in the United Nations further compels countries to do everything possible to protect the climate. Any wrongful act that violates these agreements must be immediately stopped, followed by \"full reparations\" and compensation made to the injured parties.",
      "\"Vanuatu looks forward to collaborating with other States on implementing the Court's decision,\" Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister of climate change and environment, said in a statement. \"A victory in the world's highest court is just the beginning. Success will depend on what happens next through coordinated efforts across diplomacy, politics, litigation, and advocacy to turn this moment into a true turning point.\"",
      "For Vanuatu, a country that comprises 83 islands with a combined size roughly the same as Connecticut, the decision is monumental. Officials said the country was responsible for less than 0.0004% of global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1962 and 2022, but experiences disproportionate impacts of climate change.",
      "In addition to its average temperature rising, Vanuatu is seeing more severe and intense tropical cyclones. In 2023, it was hit by three cyclones that were Category 4 or higher, impacting nearly 200,000 residents and costing the country more than $400 million in economic damages. The western tropical Pacific Ocean has risen 4-6 inches between 1992-2020, which is particularly dangerous for the country as much of it is low-lying and vulnerable to erosion. All of this, along with increased precipitation and periods of drought, has caused entire communities to be relocated by the government, and the impacts are anticipated to grow more severe.",
      "\"Today, the world's smallest countries have made history,\" Vishal Prasad, director of Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, said in a statement. \"The ICJ's decision brings us closer to a world where governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities. It affirms a simple truth of climate justice: those who did the least to fuel this crisis deserve protection, reparations, and a future. This ruling is a lifeline for Pacific communities on the frontline.\"",
      "While the advisory opinion is not legally binding, environmental organizations and law experts are hopeful that the ruling can set a legal precedent for the thousands of climate change cases around the world that are attempting to hold larger governments and companies accountable for climate pollution.",
      "\"This opinion can serve as a compass for countries who are thinking about how to prioritize justice and prioritize the safety of their citizens while also being in compliance with international law,\" said Carly Phillips, a research scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists who worked with the legal teams of seven countries that submitted supporting statements to the court asking for the opinion.",
      "The United States does not accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, but it did submit a written statement in March 2024 and participated in oral arguments, arguing that members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 2015 Paris Agreement already compel signatories to address climate change impacts and protects them from accountability for harming the climate.",
      "But Vanuatu's Prime Minister Jotham Napat has been skeptical of the power of the U.N. convention and the Paris Agreement, saying in a statement that neither are \"generating the actions the world urgently needs fast enough.\" He believes a favorable opinion from the court could \"support vulnerable nations in securing climate finance, technology, and loss and damage support.\"",
      "The court addressed this concern in its opinion and dismissed the legal argument that environmental treaties, like the Paris Agreement, protect polluters from accountability. In fact, the court emphasized that the Paris Agreement imposes strong mitigation and adaptation obligations on all parties and requires them to respond to loss and damages from climate change.",
      "Given that the United States is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, according to international data, the decision to hold large emitters responsible might be concerning, but President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement for a second time earlier this year.",
      "The court called out countries like the United States, saying that nations that are not party to climate treaties but are members of the United Nations must meet \"equivalent obligations under customary international law.\"",
      "The impact of the opinion remains to be seen. \"It's likely not going to have a lot of influence in the United States,\" said Maria Antonia Tigre, director of global climate litigation at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.",
      "Tigre said that while the decision may not influence domestic court cases in the U.S. and the country can't be sued under the decision, the real impact could be seen internationally. A court in Brazil, for example, could cite the opinion in one of the 135 current climate change cases making its way through its domestic court system.",
      "The U.N. court also pointed out that corporate polluters are open to the advisory opinion, especially if they are based abroad in a country that is party to the U.N. and climate treaties. \"Countries have an obligation to put an end to wrongful acts,\" said Tigre. \"If a country is found to be in breach by giving permits to an oil company, they may need to revoke those permits.\"",
      "Representatives for Vanuatu said the next step is to take the decision back to the U.N. General Assembly to pursue a full resolution to support the implementation of the decision. The opinion will be a primary focus when U.N. countries meet in November for the next climate change conference, known as COP30, in Brazil.",

    "story": [
      "For nearly two decades, no one had spotted the world's smallest-known snake.",
      "Some scientists worried that maybe the Barbados threadsnake had become extinct, but one sunny morning, Connor Blades lifted a rock in a tiny forest in the eastern Caribbean island and held his breath.",
      "\"After a year of searching, you begin to get a little pessimistic,\" said Blades, project officer with the Ministry of Environment in Barbados.",
      "The snake can fit comfortably on a coin, so it was able to elude scientists for almost 20 years.",
      "Scientifically named Tetracheilostoma carlae, the petite creature is listed as Critically Endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species when it was last assessed in 2015.",
      "Too tiny to identify with the naked eye, Blades placed it in a small glass jar and added soil, substrate and leaf litter.",
      "Several hours later, in front of a microscope at the University of the West Indies, Blades looked at the specimen. It wriggled in the petri dish, making it nearly impossible to identify.",
      "\"It was a struggle,\" Blades recalled, adding that he shot a video of the snake and finally identified it thanks to a still image.",
      "It had pale yellow dorsal lines running through its body, and its eyes were located on the side of its head.",
      "\"I tried to keep a level head,\" Blades recalled, knowing that the Barbados threadsnake looks very much like a Brahminy blind snake, best known as the flower pot snake, which is a bit longer and has no dorsal lines.",
      "On Wednesday, the Re:wild conservation group, which is collaborating with the local environment ministry, announced the rediscovery of the Barbados threadsnake.",
      "\"Rediscovering one of our endemics on many levels is significant,\" said Justin Springer, Caribbean program officer for Re:wild who helped rediscover the snake along with Blades. \"It reminds us that we still have something important left that plays an important role in our ecosystem.\"",
      "The Barbados threadsnake has only been seen a handful of times since 1889. It was on a list of 4,800 plant, animal and fungi species that Re:wild described as \"lost to science.\"",
      "There's no information on its population and the most recent record of the snake was a 2005 photograph from near Hillaby town in St. Thomas Parish, according to the IUCN. One of the oldest known records of the species dates back to 1918, and it has only been rarely spotted since then, with a few documentations from 1966, 1997 and 2008, the Switzerland-based conservation organization said.",
      "\"Given the dense human population on Barbados, if the species was simply underrecorded it seems likely that local people would be aware of additional records,\" the IUCN said on its website. \"The lack of records suggests that this species is genuinely rare and restricted.\"",
      "The snake is blind, burrows in the ground, eats termites and ants and lays one single, slender egg. Fully grown, it measures up to four inches.",
      "\"They're very cryptic,\" Blades said. \"You can do a survey for a number of hours, and even if they are there, you may actually not see them.\"",
      "But on March 20 at around 10:30 a.m., Blades and Springer surrounded a jack-in-the-box tree in central Barbados and started looking under rocks while the rest of the team began measuring the tree, whose distribution is very limited in Barbados.",
      "\"That's why the story is so exciting,\" Springer said. \"It all happened around the same time.\"",
      "S. Blair Hedges, a professor at Temple University and director of its center for biology, was the first to identify the Barbados threadsnake. Previously, it was mistakenly lumped in with another species.",
      "In 2008, Hedges' discovery was published in a scientific journal, with the snake baptized Tetracheilostoma carlae, in honor of his wife.",
      "\"I spent days searching for them,\" Hedges recalled. \"Based on my observations and the hundreds of rocks, objects that I turned over looking for this thing without success, I do think it is a rare species.\"",
      "That was June 2006, and there were only three other such specimens known at the time: two at a London museum and a third at a museum collection in California that was wrongly identified as being from Antigua instead of Barbados, Hedges said.",
      "Hedges said that he didn't realize he had collected a new species until he did a genetic analysis.",
      "\"The aha moment was in the laboratory,\" he said, noting that the discovery established the Barbados threadsnake as the world's smallest-known snake.",
      "Hedges then became inundated for years with letters, photographs and emails from people thinking they had found more Barbados threadsnakes. Some of the pictures were of earthworms, he recalled.",
      "\"It was literally years of distraction,\" he said.",
      "Scientists hope the rediscovery means that the Barbados threadsnake could become a champion for the protection of wildlife habitat.",
      "A lot of endemic species on the tiny island have gone extinct, including the Barbados racer, the Barbados skink and a particular species of cave shrimp.",
      "\"I hope they can get some interest in protecting it,\" Hedges said. \"Barbados is kind of unique in the Caribbean for a bad reason: it has the least amount of original forest, outside of Haiti.\""

    "story": [
      "Gaza City\u00a0\u2014 The head of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said on Tuesday that 21 children had died across the Palestinian territory in the past three days \"due to malnutrition and starvation.\"",
      "\"These deaths were recorded at hospitals in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah and Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis ... over the past 72 hours,\" Mohammed Abu Salmiya told reporters.",
      "United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned Monday evening that \"the last lifelines keeping people alive are collapsing\" in Gaza, and that there were growing reports of children and adults exhibiting symptoms of malnutrition.",
      "Abu Salmiya told reporters that new cases of malnutrition and starvation were arriving at Gaza's remaining functioning hospitals \"every moment,\" adding: \"We are heading towards alarming numbers of deaths due to the starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza.\"",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, the U.N. human rights office said many people were arriving at Gaza's hospitals \"in a state of severe exhaustion caused by a lack of food. Others are collapsing in the streets. Many more may be dying unreported ... These deaths and the horrendous physical and psychological suffering caused by hunger are the result of Israel's interference with and militarization of humanitarian assistance.\"",
      "Photos emerging from Gaza in recent days have shown children and infants with severe malnutrition, including some said by hospital workers to have died of the condition. According to the National Institutes of Health, severe malnutrition typically causes symptoms including dramatic wasting, or fat and muscle loss, poor circulation and extreme fatigue.",
      "\"Hospitals are already overwhelmed by the number of casualties from gunfire. They can't provide much more help for hunger-related symptoms because of food and medicine shortages,\" Khalil al-Deqran, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, told the Reuters news agency. Deqran said there were 600,000 people suffering from malnutrition symptoms such as dehydration and anemia, including 60,000 pregnant women.",
      "After talks to extend a six-week ceasefire broke down, Israel imposed a full blockade on Gaza on March 2 this year, allowing no aid in until trucks were again permitted to cross the border in late May. The U.N. and aid organizations say the quantity of food and other emergency supplies being allowed into Gaza since then has been vastly insufficient, however.",
      "Food stocks accumulated inside the Palestinian territory during the ceasefire have depleted, leaving the territory's more than two million inhabitants experiencing the worst shortages since the start of the war sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others taken hostage during that siege more than 650 days ago, and 20 of the captives are still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "World Food Program director Carl Skau, who visited Gaza City in early July, called the situation \"the worst\" he had ever seen.",
      "Last Sunday, the civil defense agency in Hamas-run Gaza reported that at least three infants had died from \"severe hunger and malnutrition\" over the previous week.",
      "On Monday, the governments of 25 countries, including Israeli and U.S. allies Britain, France, Australia and Canada, urged an immediate end to the war, the unconditional release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and the free flow of aid.",
      "In their joint statement, they accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's U.S.-backed government of the \"drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children\" in Gaza.",
      "The nations also condemned a new system for aid distribution backed by Israel's military that was launched in late May with the support of the Trump administration, but no support from other nations or humanitarian organizations.",
      "The U.N.'s human rights office said Tuesday that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operations on May 26.",
      "Officially a private effort, the GHF began working in Gaza \u2014 with virtually no information provided about its funding or management \u2014 after Israel imposed the more than two-month blockade on all supplies entering Gaza.",
      "The group's operations, focused around four \"humanitarian hubs\" for food distribution, have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.",
      "\"As of July 21, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near U.N. and other humanitarian organizations' aid convoys,\" U.N. human rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told the AFP news agency. He said the agency's data was \"based on information from multiple reliable sources on the ground, including medical teams, humanitarian and human rights organizations.\"",
      "GHF says it has distributed more than 1.4 million boxes of foodstuffs to date and that it adjusts its \"operations in real time to keep people safe and informed, and we stand ready to partner with other organizations to scale up and deliver more meals to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "The U.N. and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives and violates basic humanitarian principles. The group has never commented, despite numerous questions from CBS News, on any links it has with the U.S. or Israeli governments.",
      "The Trump administration announced its first public support for the GHF \u2014 $30 million in funding \u2014 earlier this month, and called on other organizations and countries to cooperate with the group, saying that, in its view, it provides the only  means of delivering aid in Gaza without the risk of Hamas stealing it.",

      "The world's first hybrid solar cargo ship has just launched in Germany, marking a major milestone for sustainable shipping. The Blue Marlin uses advanced solar technology not only to power its onboard systems but also to drive its main propulsion, setting a new standard for eco-friendly cargo transport. By combining solar panels with a diesel-electric system, this vessel is paving the way for cleaner, more efficient movement of goods along Germany's waterways.",

      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "How solar power moves the Blue Marlin",
      "The Blue Marlin uses 192 solar panels, which can generate up to 35 kilowatts in ideal conditions. That\u2019s enough to charge over 1,400 smartphones at the same time. Wattlab designed the solar system to supply electricity directly to the ship\u2019s propulsion system. Unlike earlier vessels, the Blue Marlin uses solar energy for movement, not just for basic onboard functions. When conditions allow, the ship can run on solar power alone for short trips. For example, it can do this when traveling downstream with a light load.",
      "Hybrid technology for reliable shipping",
      "The Blue Marlin also relies on four diesel generators. This hybrid setup lets the vessel switch between solar and diesel-electric power as needed. As a result, the ship stays reliable in any weather. An automated energy management system controls how power is distributed. This system sends energy exactly where it is needed. It also reduces unnecessary fuel use, which helps the environment. In addition, the ship uses a technique called peak shaving. During high energy demand, it draws on solar and battery reserves instead of starting extra generators. This strategy lowers emissions and keeps the operation smooth.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "The Blue Martin is well suited for Germany\u2019s waterways",
      "The Blue Marlin measures approximately 282 feet in length and 31 feet in width, with a shallow draft of just 3 feet 7 inches, making it well suited for Germany's canal network. Its hull was constructed in Romania and later outfitted with systems in the Netherlands. Today, the fully completed vessel operates out of Cologne, Germany. SEAFAR remote navigation technology is another feature; this system allows remote-controlled operation on select routes, improving safety and reducing the workload for the crew.",
      "The Blue Marlin\u2019s environmental impact and design benefits",
      "Each year, the Blue Marlin's solar array can generate up to 37,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity. This output helps prevent about 79,000 pounds of CO\u2082 emissions annually. Thanks to its modular design, the ship can connect with push barges and carry up to 3,430 short tons of bulk goods efficiently. Its hybrid diesel-electric system is also designed to run on cleaner fuels in the future, making it adaptable as greener energy options become more available.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Blue Marlin is more than a technological showcase. By fully integrating solar power with intelligent hybrid systems, it proves that performance and environmental responsibility can work together. This vessel stands as a practical example of cleaner shipping solutions. It offers lessons and inspiration for the future of cargo transport around the world.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft announces the first handheld Xbox device, and it\u2019s primed to take on Nintendo\u2019s best-selling Switch 2.",
      "Windows 11 has had poor adoption, with many people sticking to the good old Windows 10. Microsoft has been pushing users to upgrade, threatening to end software support and warning about potential cybersecurity risks. But Windows 11 isn\u2019t exactly the best OS to come out of Redmond. Even if it were, many people simply can\u2019t upgrade because of its steep system requirements.",
      "In fact, it took Windows 11 nearly four years after its 2021 debut to finally surpass its predecessor in user numbers. Now that Windows 10 is being phased out, many users, especially those with older PCs that don't meet the hardware requirements, are understandably concerned. Tony from Wisconsin recently asked us the same thing:",
      "\"I heard that Microsoft will stop providing security patches for Windows 10 after October. My laptop can't be upgraded to Windows 11 because the CPU is too old. Since I'm not tech-savvy and don't feel comfortable replacing the CPU (nor do I want to), I'm wondering if I have a good antivirus program, do I still need to upgrade? Or will my system still be vulnerable to hackers and viruses?\"",
      "I understand your concern, Tony. Sticking with an unsupported OS brings security risks. Security researchers warn that unsupported systems, such as Windows 10, will become increasingly attractive targets for hackers. Hackers often reverse-engineer patches released for newer systems like Windows 11 to find similar flaws in older ones like Windows 10. With no more fixes coming, those vulnerabilities remain wide open, making unsupported systems a tempting target.",

      "Image showing Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Windows 11 finally surpasses Windows 10 in market share: Here's why it took so long",
      "According to Statcounter, Windows 11 has finally overtaken Windows 10 in terms of desktop and laptop usage as of early July. The newer OS now accounts for 52 percent of all Windows installations, up sharply from just under 48 percent in June. In the same period, Windows 10 dropped from 53.2 percent to 44.6 percent. Interestingly, Windows 7 still holds a small but notable presence, with 2.35 percent of users refusing to let it go.",
      "This shift comes nearly four years after Microsoft announced Windows 11 in June 2021. From the start, it was criticized for strict hardware rules. It required a TPM 2.0 chip and newer processors. Many functional PCs were left unable to upgrade.\u00a0 The operating system also introduced a revamped user interface that some users found unnecessary or confusing, leading to a slow adoption rate.",
      "A man typing on a Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens when Windows 10 support ends in 2025? Here's what you need to know",
      "Windows 10 is reaching the end of its official support on October 14, 2025. That means Microsoft will stop releasing new features and routine security updates for the general public. For most users, this marks the end of the road, unless they take specific steps to keep receiving updates.",
      "To extend security updates beyond this deadline, Microsoft is offering a program called Extended Security Updates (ESU). Normally, this would cost $30 per year for personal users. However, Microsoft is making the first year free if you back up your PC using the Windows Backup app and sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "Microsoft hasn't disclosed pricing beyond the first year, so it's unclear whether the $30/year rate will remain the same in 2026 and 2027.",
      "If you don't opt into either of those methods, you'll need to pay the $30 to continue receiving critical patches through October 2026. This is especially relevant for those who can't upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations.",
      "Even after general support ends, Microsoft will keep updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows 10 until October 2028. So while full system security updates will stop for most, basic malware protection will continue for a few more years.",
      "Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can't upgrade to Windows 11? 8 Safe alternatives for Windows 10 users in 2025",
      "You can continue using Windows 10 until October 14, 2025, with full access to regular security and stability updates. After that, you can extend protection by enrolling in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates program. The first year is free if you use the Windows Backup app to sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "If your computer meets the hardware requirements for Windows 11, upgrading is the easiest long-term solution. You\u2019ll get access to ongoing feature updates, improved security, and long-term support through at least 2031.",
      "Google offers a free operating system called ChromeOS Flex, designed for older PCs and laptops. It\u2019s based on the same system used in Chromebooks and focuses on speed, simplicity, and security. However, it doesn\u2019t support Android apps or some hardware features like fingerprint readers and may not work for tasks like video editing or gaming.. This can be a great option if you mostly use web apps like Gmail, Google Docs, or Zoom.",
      "Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Zorin OS provide a stable and user-friendly experience, especially for those coming from Windows. You can use them on older hardware without any licensing fees, and they come with access to thousands of free applications. While there may be a bit of a learning curve, many users find Linux reliable and surprisingly easy to adapt to for everyday tasks like browsing, writing, and media playback.",
      "If your current system can\u2019t handle Windows 11 and you are not interested in alternatives like ChromeOS or Linux, investing in a new computer may be the most straightforward path. New devices come with Windows 11 pre-installed and are built to support it fully. This ensures you\u2019ll continue to receive updates, features, and support for several years without additional effort.",

      "If you decide to stick with Windows 10 beyond its official support period, having strong third-party antivirus protection becomes even more important. While Microsoft Defender will continue receiving updates until 2028, it may not be enough on its own once the system stops getting core security patches. Installing a reputable antivirus program can help protect your device from malware, phishing, and other threats.",

You could also switch to a different operating system. Another option is investing in stronger security tools. And be on alert: as Windows 10\u2019s end-of-life nears, scammers will take advantage. Watch out for phone calls, emails, or pop-ups pretending to be from Microsoft offering \"urgent upgrade help.\" Microsoft doesn\u2019t call users out of the blue\u2014these are scams trying to steal your personal info or install malware.

      "We all know staying hydrated is important, but most of us don't actually track how much water we need. The signs of dehydration, like dizziness, fatigue, or confusion, can creep in before you even realize you're in trouble. By the time you feel thirsty, you're already behind. That's what makes the new wearable hydration sensor so valuable. Instead of guessing, this device provides real-time data, allowing you to stay ahead of dehydration, rather than just react to it.",

      "Single-side electrode configuration setup using hydration bioimpedance sensor. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "How the wearable hydration sensor works",
      "Developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, the sensor is designed to detect early signs of dehydration using a method called bioimpedance. This method sends a small, painless electrical current through your bicep and measures how easily that current flows through your tissue. Because water is a good conductor of electricity, well-hydrated tissue lets the current pass easily. When you're dehydrated, your tissues resist the current, and the sensor detects that. The sensor connects wirelessly to a smartphone app, delivering instant feedback about your hydration level. You don't have to stop what you're doing or wait for lab results. The data is continuous and always available.",
      "Wearable hydration sensor benefits for workouts, jobs, and health",
      "This isn't just cool tech, it's practical. For athletes pushing through workouts in the heat, the sensor could help them avoid fatigue or cramping. For firefighters or police officers wearing heavy gear in scorching temperatures, it offers a way to stay safe on the job. Even office workers who forget to drink water during long meetings could benefit from a reminder when their hydration levels drop. The researchers believe the wearable hydration sensor could also play a major role in health care. Patients with kidney problems or cardiovascular issues often need to monitor hydration closely. Until now, that meant invasive tests or relying on symptoms. This sensor could make hydration tracking simple, accurate, and non-invasive.",
      "The science behind the hydration sensor",
      "To make sure the sensor really works, the research team ran controlled experiments. They had participants take a diuretic to promote fluid loss and tracked hydration using the sensor. At the same time, they collected urine samples to confirm results. The sensor's data closely matched the chemical markers in the samples. That means the technology is not only accurate, but it can also be trusted even during normal daily activities like walking or working. Study co-author Matija Jankovic explained that arm bioimpedance was highly sensitive to changes in hydration. It also aligned with whole-body hydration, making it a reliable alternative to traditional testing.",
      "Rigid PCB and commercial gel electrode system. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "Traditional hydration tests fall short",
      "Standard ways of checking hydration, like urine tests or blood work, are time-consuming and not practical for everyday use. Some commercial tools already exist, but they tend to be bulky or require users to stay in one spot. They're just not built for real life. That's where this sensor has the edge. It's compact, portable, and constantly running in the background. It works while you move, exercise, or even just sit at your desk.",
      "What's next for hydration tracking",
      "Right now, the sensor tracks relative changes in hydration, which is a powerful tool on its own. But the research team wants to take it further. They plan to collect data from a larger population to create baseline values for absolute hydration levels. This step would make the device even more accurate and personal. They're also exploring new wearable designs, such as breathable e-tattoos and sweat-wicking sensors, that could offer better comfort and longer wear. Future models might track hydration in other areas of the body, like the forearm or thigh. The team is optimistic that these innovations will make hydration tracking even more seamless and accessible. Lead researcher Nanshu Lu, who has worked on similar wearable health tech in the past, says this is only the beginning. Her vision is to bring simple, real-time hydration tracking to everyone, no matter their lifestyle or profession.",
      "A woman sweating during a workout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Staying hydrated just got a whole lot easier. With a wearable hydration sensor, you no longer have to rely on guesswork or vague reminders to drink water. Whether you're powering through a workout, focused on a demanding job, or just caught up in a busy day, this device keeps tabs on your hydration status in real time. That means you get clear, instant feedback-before dehydration slows you down.",
      "While this technology is still in the research and development phase, the early results are promising. It's not yet available to the public, but the groundwork is in place. Once it moves into production, this kind of real-time hydration tracking could become a part of daily life, helping you stay healthier, more alert, and ahead of the curve.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Dehydration isn't always obvious, but it can quickly become serious. The wearable hydration sensor puts the power to monitor your health back in your hands. It's accurate, non-invasive, and built for daily life. Whether you're training for a marathon or just trying to stay sharp at work, knowing your hydration status in real time could make all the difference.",

      "What is the coffee ring effect, and why does it matter in science?",
      "Ever wondered why spilled coffee, wine or tea dries in a ring rather than evenly? This common pattern is known as the \"coffee ring effect.\" The phenomenon occurs because of the liquid's surface tension. As the drop begins to dry, water at the edges evaporates more quickly since that area is thinner. To keep up, liquid from the center flows outward, carrying tiny particles with it. Once the drop is completely dry, these particles settle along the edge, creating the signature ring stain you see on tables and countertops every day.",

Researchers at UC Berkeley transformed this everyday nuisance into a powerful new at-home diagnostic test. This innovative test can identify diseases like COVID-19, prostate cancer and sepsis with remarkable accuracy. In fact, it is up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests. Even better, it delivers results in just twelve minutes, depending on the test.",
      "The idea began with Kamyar Behrouzi, a former Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. While developing a COVID-19 biosensor in 2020, he noticed that virus particles, much like coffee particles, tend to gather at the edge of a droplet. By using this natural effect, the researchers designed a test that captures and concentrates disease markers, making detection much easier. Thanks to this stain-inspired science, fast and reliable testing is now possible right at home.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How this coffee-inspired test detects COVID-19, sepsis, and more",
      "So, how does this innovative test actually work? First, you place a small sample from your nose or cheek onto a special membrane. As the sample dries, disease proteins concentrate at the edges to form a visible ring. Next, you add a second droplet containing light-reactive particles. If certain disease biomarkers are present, these nanoparticles light up when exposed to light. You can see positive results with the naked eye in some cases, or verify them more accurately using a special AI-powered smartphone app.",
      "This rapid test does more than detect COVID-19. It can also identify early signs of sepsis, a life-threatening infection that needs quick treatment. To make home testing accessible, the UC Berkeley team even created a 3D-printed prototype for easy use on your kitchen counter. According to professor Liwei Lin, this innovative approach could transform regular health screening, with no lab visit required.",

      "A man kicking a ball while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "How the e-OPRA bionic knee for amputees works",
      "The tech is called e-OPRA (Enhanced Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees). It involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthetic limb. This rod becomes the foundation of a new kind of interface between the body and machine. But it doesn't stop there.",
      "Using a specialized surgical technique known as Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface (AMI), muscles are reconnected in functional pairs. These muscles \"talk\" to each other, sending signals to the robotic controller, which calculates exactly how the knee should move, mirroring how a real leg works.",
      "Natural movement restored with the bionic knee for amputees",
      "In trials, two patients with this integrated system not only performed better, but they also felt better. They moved faster, climbed stairs with more ease, and avoided obstacles with greater confidence. Most importantly, they felt like the prosthetic was part of their body.",

      "Why the bionic knee for amputees is a major breakthrough",
      "Traditional socket-based prosthetics can be uncomfortable, unstable, and prone to infections. They often feel foreign, like a tool strapped to the body rather than a part of it. The bionic knee bypasses the socket altogether. By connecting directly to bone and muscle, it improves load-bearing, reduces skin problems, and most importantly, restores a sense of control. And control isn't just physical, it's emotional and psychological. Patients using the e-OPRA system reported a greater sense of agency and body ownership than those with traditional or partially-integrated prosthetics.",
      "MIT's bionic knee for amputees driven by lived experience",
      "Professor Hugh Herr isn't just leading the research; he's living it. After losing both legs below the knee to frostbite in his teens, he returned to mountain climbing and dedicated his career to advancing prosthetic technology. His personal journey powers a lab at MIT that continues to push the boundaries of biomechatronics. And now, that journey may change the lives of above-the-knee amputees worldwide.",

      "We're witnessing the future of\u00a0prosthetics unfold. The bionic knee developed by MIT doesn't just restore function, it redefines it. By merging advanced robotics with the human nervous system, it offers amputees something priceless: the feeling that their body is whole again.",

      "Photo showing fentanyl pills seized at the U.S. border. (Elizabeth Denis/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID detects drugs faster than swab tests",
      "This portable air scanner, created at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is being brought to market by California-based instrument maker BaySpec. The device works by pulling in air and identifying molecules in real time using a miniature mass spectrometer.",
      "Unlike traditional swab tests that take five to thirty minutes, VaporID detects fentanyl in seconds, even at levels as low as six parts per trillion. That's like spotting a single pine needle in an entire forest.",
      "Why drug dogs may soon be outmatched by VaporID",
      "For decades, trained canines have been the gold standard at ports of entry. But dogs have limits; they tire, need handlers, and can't be reprogrammed with software updates. VaporID, on the other hand, never needs a nap. It can detect not only known drugs but also fentanyl analogs, lab-made variants designed to skirt detection.",
      "The system's cutting-edge design includes an atmospheric flow tube that allows tiny drug molecules more time to interact with charged ions. That chemical dance dramatically boosts sensitivity, making it possible to detect even the most elusive threats.",

      "Illustration of the action within the atmospheric flow tube that is a key to the detection of trace levels of fentanyl. (Sara Levine/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID works: Air, ions, and instant answers",
      "VaporID weighs about 40 pounds and draws in ambient air like a miniature vacuum. Suspicious molecules are filtered, tagged with electrically charged ions, and passed into a tiny mass spectrometer. Only the relevant particles make it through. This process filters out background interfering vapors from things like perfumes or cleaning agents, giving border agents a clear, accurate, and immediate read on potentially dangerous substances.",
      "What VaporID means for border security",
      "If deployed widely, VaporID could revolutionize how U.S. Customs and Border Protection detects narcotics and explosives. Its fast, hands-free scanning would help agents screen vehicles, cargo, luggage, and even people, without relying solely on canine units or invasive sampling.",
      "The device's sensitivity also opens doors for use beyond borders. The Department of Homeland Security is already working with PNNL and BaySpec to adapt the technology for mail screening, airport baggage checks, and large-scale cargo inspections.",
      "For materials like TNT (trinitrotoluene) and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), both powerful explosives that release very few molecules into the air, VaporID's ultra-sensitive detection provides a level of protection that's long been out of reach with current methods.",
      "Chemist Elizabeth Denis uses the PNNL system to check a substance in the laboratory. (Andrea Starr/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "VaporID\u2019s role in combating drug and explosive smuggling",
      "The U.S. is facing a deadly influx of synthetic opioids. According to the CDC, over 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2024, including approximately 48,400 deaths linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Fast, contactless detection at ports of entry could help choke off the supply chain before these deadly substances ever hit the streets. And in an era of rising geopolitical tensions, having a portable scanner that can also detect explosives could be a critical layer in national defense.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology doesn\u2019t just assist border agents anymore; it\u2019s starting to outperform their most trusted tools. VaporID brings speed, precision, and reliability to a job where seconds count. While drug-sniffing dogs have served well, this portable air scanner may soon lead the front line in detecting threats. As agencies prepare to roll out the system, one thing is clear. The future of border security doesn\u2019t bark. It beeps.",

      "Kinisi built KR1 to thrive in real-world industrial environments. The robot has two arms and hands, which allow it to lift items weighing up to 22 pounds. Thanks to its strong structure and careful engineering, KR1 can retrieve items from high shelves and handle breakable products without damage. It performs these tasks using a wheeled base that allows for smooth, agile movement across standard warehouse floors. Kinisi intentionally avoided complex legged systems to simplify setup and improve stability. KR1 can operate for up to eight hours on a single charge. It features hot-swappable batteries and an auto-docking system that allows for fast recharging with minimal human intervention. These features make it ideal for continuous use in busy fulfillment centers where downtime costs money.",

      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where this humanoid warehouse robot can work beyond logistics",
      "KR1 is already proving useful in logistics, but its design makes it suitable for a wide range of industries. In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "How much does KR1 cost? Here's what we know",
      "During a recent presentation at Automate 2025, Kinisi CEO Brennand Pierce revealed that the robot currently costs around $4,000 per month. That rate appears to be part of a subscription-based model, which may include the robot, its onboard AI and ongoing support. Instead of selling KR1 outright, Kinisi is targeting small to mid-size warehouses with a flexible, monthly pricing strategy.",
      "This approach allows businesses to adopt automation without making large upfront investments or overhauling their infrastructure. Although the company hasn't confirmed what the monthly fee includes, the model positions KR1 as a scalable, low-risk solution for logistics teams looking to boost productivity fast.",

      "A team of academic researchers has uncovered a new Android security exploit that raises a lot of questions about the platform\u2019s permission system. The technique, named TapTrap, uses user interface animations to visually deceive you into granting sensitive permissions or performing harmful actions. Unlike earlier tapjacking attacks, TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces.

      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

      "Amazon website\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI project?",
      "Starfish is a multi-year initiative built around generative AI. According to an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider, the system gathers product data from across the web, including external websites and images. It then uses large language models (LLMs) to create \"complete, correct and consistent\" product listings. This isn't a small update. Amazon expects Starfish to boost sales by $7.5 billion in 2025 alone by improving conversion rates and expanding product variety.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How Amazon is using AI to improve product listings",
      "Starfish builds on earlier AI tools that Amazon began testing in 2023. These tools could:",

      "Now, with Starfish, Amazon wants to scale that effort across millions of listings. The AI will also collect data from 200,000 external brand websites by crawling, scraping and mapping their content to Amazon's catalog. It's not yet clear whether Amazon's own web crawler, Amazonbot, is powering Starfish. But the company confirmed to Business Insider that Starfish is already supporting its new \"Buy for Me\" feature. This feature recommends products from external websites and lets shoppers buy them directly within Amazon's app.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Amazon built the Starfish AI for marketplace listings",
      "Manually creating product listings is slow and often inconsistent. That's a problem when Amazon wants to offer a massive selection with reliable information. If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",
      "In short, expect a more automated Amazon shopping experience, with both conveniences and questions about how your data and the broader web are being used to power it.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon's Starfish project signals a major shift in how e-commerce works. By combining web scraping, AI models and deep integration into its Marketplace, Amazon hopes to automate one of the most time-consuming parts of online selling. For buyers and sellers, this could mean more convenience and better results. But it also raises important questions about transparency, data ownership and the future role of AI in shaping what we see online.",

      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",

      "\"Unfortunately, a lot of credentials are harvested and sold on the dark web between different threat actor groups despite strong passwords or MFA barriers. Maybe someone lost their password or an administrator had theirs saved on a laptop that was part of another breach. Once those passwords are collected, they get traded or sold,\" Daniel explained.",
      "While brute-force attacks still happen, most criminals don't waste time hammering away at complex passwords. Instead, they exploit simpler routes: snatching passwords from old breaches, targeting users directly or hijacking password vaults, especially those managed by social media admins.",
      "\"Brute-force attacks make a lot of noise and can trigger alerts. It's not the most popular strategy anymore because it's so noisy,\" Tobok adds.",

      "Tobok points out, \"There really isn't public-facing software that notifies you. Sometimes, you might get an email saying, 'We noticed unusual activity. Was this you?' That typically comes through MFA channels. But most executives don't manage their own social media accounts. It's usually someone on their team or a designated admin.

      "Researchers at the China Building Materials Academy (CBMA) and their partners designed the material to weigh just 12.5 pounds per cubic foot. That's about one-tenth the weight of standard concrete. Its strength comes from a network of microscopic bubbles, each coated with a special maleated rosin.

      "Why traditional runway safety systems fall short",
      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",
      "Soil becomes unstable in wet or freezing conditions. Water can freeze in winter and attract wildlife, creating new hazards. Sand and grass don't always perform well, especially with heavier aircraft. These weaknesses have made it clear that airports need a more reliable and consistent safety solution.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How marshmallow concrete works: The science behind the softness",
      "Marshmallow concrete is engineered with a precise strength between 0.30 and 0.35 megapascals. If it's too strong, it won't crush and absorb energy. If it's too weak, it won't slow the plane. The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",
      "An airliner coming in for a landing (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Durability and cost benefits of marshmallow concrete for airports",
      "Unlike some international systems that rely on expensive calcium sulfoaluminate cement, marshmallow concrete uses ordinary cement, making it far more affordable for airports, especially those with limited budgets. The team also developed a two-stage strength-control system that helps the material adapt to harsh climates and maintain consistent performance throughout the year.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Real-world data from 14 airports in China, including one in the challenging climate of Tibet, show that the material's properties fluctuated by just three percent over a year. This result is well below the design tolerance of ten percent, which means airports can depend on the material to perform reliably, regardless of the weather.",

      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk. Marshmallow concrete offers a low-cost, highly effective safety upgrade that could prevent these incidents or dramatically reduce their severity.",
      "The best part? This isn't some billion-dollar overhaul. Because it uses standard cement and is designed to work in all kinds of weather, including harsh winters and extreme heat, it\u2019s a practical option for airports from Maine to Arizona. That means even smaller regional airports across the U.S. could benefit.",
      "You may never see this material, but it could be quietly protecting your flight behind the scenes, ready to absorb impact and bring a plane to a safe stop if something goes wrong.

      "Only share the information needed to complete the application. Do not provide sensitive details like your Social Security Number, bank account information, or full home address unless you are certain the platform is legitimate and secure.",
      "An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address. It also keeps your job search organized, helps you spot\u00a0scams\u00a0quickly, and reduces the damage if a company mishandles your data.",

A data-removal service helps reduce your online footprint by scanning hundreds of data broker sites and requesting the removal of your information. This lowers the risk of your personal data being leaked, exploited in phishing scams, or used for impersonation.",

      "This incident was a serious but limited security issue. Thanks to responsible disclosure by researchers and Paradox.ai's rapid response, the exposure was contained to just five candidate records, and no personal data was leaked or misused. That said, the event is a reminder: when AI is involved in hiring, data privacy must remain a top concern. Even small oversights, like a forgotten test account, can put real people's data at risk.",

Despite a trove of new information released by authorities after his sentencing, key questions remain unanswered.",
      "For no known reason, he entered an off-campus rental house at 1122 King Road around 4 a.m. Nov. 13, 2022, killing four undergrads inside: Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20.",
      "With a gag order lifted and a trove of confidential documents compiled by investigators expected to become public, there may still be more questions than answers after investigators revealed this week that the 30-year-old former criminology Ph.D. student wiped his devices and left no clues as to a motive or which of the students he was targeting and why.",
      "\"[The] problem is he had a few weeks head start on hiding his tracks before he ever ended up on their radar,\" said Joshua Ritter, a Los Angeles defense attorney and Fox News contributor. \"That's a lot of times in the hands of a man with some education on police investigative procedures.\"",

      "\"Obvious questions like, 'where is the knife?' and 'what did he do with his clothing?' still remain,\" Ritter said.",
      "The murder weapon was never recovered despite extensive search efforts, the case's two lead detectives said at a news briefing Wednesday.

But while they recovered a Ka-Bar knife sheath with Kohberger's DNA on it from the crime scene, they never found the matching knife.",

      "Despite reporting that suggested Kohberger first eyed Mogen or Kernodle at the Greek restaurant in Moscow where they both worked, speculation that he had followed one or more of the victims on social media or that he had been enraged by his inability to attract women, the only concrete tie police revealed between Kohberger and the victims before the slayings were frequent visits to their home.",

    "summary": "Former Obama aides say they have to balance between unnecessarily giving oxygen to unfounded Trump administration claims and allowing them to balloon unchecked.",
    "story": [
      "To former aides who worked in Barack Obama\u2019s White House, the Trump administration\u2019s allegations of \u201ctreason\u201d carried the stench of desperation from a president straining to shift the focus from a burgeoning scandal around Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Still, they\u2019re grappling with how to contain the unprecedented accusations National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard has leveled, even as they dismiss them as asinine, interviews with more than half a dozen people who worked in Obama\u2019s White House or on his campaigns reveal.",
      "These people say the events of the last week have turned into a messaging balancing act between unnecessarily giving oxygen to the claims that Obama ordered a false intelligence analysis to show Russia had worked to help Trump win the 2016 election and leaving the potential for unchecked accusations to balloon. Many of those who talked to NBC News were not authorized to speak publicly about strategy.",
      "\u201cThe battle now is to play this even to make sure that thoughts don\u2019t start to creep into more mainstream\u201d audiences, a former Obama administration official said. That person said it was important to reach \"mainstream Republicans,\" who would listen to editorial boards and those in Congress who deemed the allegations against Obama as \"beyond the pale.\"",
      "Some expressed uncertainty over what to expect next from Trump or his lieutenants, charging that the administration could grow more bullish to draw attention away from a string of explosive Epstein stories that Trump is struggling to tamp down. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but it has said there is merit to accusations around Obama.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what is ahead, and I don\u2019t know what their plans and intentions are,\u201d John Brennan, who was CIA director in the Obama administration, told NBC News. \u201cI just find all of this very troubling when it is being done by individuals who serve in such important positions and know what they are doing is wrong.\u201d",
      "Former National Intelligence Director James Clapper echoed Brennan\u2019s ambiguity over the Trump administration\u2019s intentions, telling CNN he would \u201clawyer up.\u201d",
      "National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe leveled claims last week that Obama administration officials manipulated intelligence and conspired to undermine the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s electoral victory in 2016. Gabbard posted on social media last Friday that she was making a criminal referral to the Justice Department. Then, this week, she stepped up publicity around the accusations from the White House briefing room.",
      "Broadly, the former Obama aides unequivocally say that there is zero merit to the allegations and that they do not believe they will lead anywhere. They point to a 2020 Senate investigation, which endorsed intelligence agencies\u2019 assessment that Russia had spread disinformation online and leaked stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 candidacy and help Trump. Trump-appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio was the acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time, which endorsed the findings.",
      "\u201cThere is no factual basis for the allegations that Tulsi Gabbard is making. She\u2019s cherry-picking things from various documents that are out of context and mischaracterized,\u201d Brennan said.",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s clear either she has not read the intelligence community assessment or she is purposely, willfully lying about the contents,\u201d he added.",
      "Obama allies also say the timing of the allegations is suspect. They emerged as Trump has struggled to contend with his own base after his administration announced it would not release more documents tied to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who faced a litany of allegations of abuse of underage women before he died by suicide.",
      "On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch, reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump in May that his name appears in the Epstein files \u2014 even though he told reporters this month that Bondi had not informed him that he was named.",
      "In the midst of a firestorm Trump has yet to shake, the administration brought out the allegations against Obama. Over the weekend, Trump reposted a fake AI-generated video of Obama being arrested on social media.",
      "Once Gabbard used the word \u201ctreason,\u201d Obama\u2019s team ramped up its messaging, leading Obama's spokesperson to release a carefully worded statement. It denounced Gabbard\u2019s accusations without mentioning Epstein, because it was \u201cbelow the dignity of the former president,\u201d a former Obama administration official said.",
      "\u201cOut of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response,\u201d Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement this week. \u201cBut these claims are outrageous enough to merit one. These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\"",
      "Ned Price, who held roles under Obama as a special assistant to the president, a National Security Council senior director and spokesperson and as a CIA senior analyst under Obama and George W. Bush, said he believed it was imperative to reach conservative audiences with a response. On Wednesday, he wrote an opinion piece for Fox News titled: \u201cAmericans should beware of Gabbard\u2019s \u2018dangerous distraction\u2019 with revisionist history of 2016 election.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a piece I would have written for any mainstream or left-of-center outlet. This was designed solely and exclusively for Fox News, because that\u2019s where this fire of disinformation is raging,\u201d Price said in an interview. \u201cI thought it was important ... to inject facts into that very venue in the hope that at least a few people would read it and be exposed to what actually transpired in 2016.\u201d"

      "At least 16 people have been killed in armed clashes between Thailand and Cambodia, as tensions over a century-old border dispute spiral into the worst fighting between the two Southeast Asian nations in over a decade.",
      "Since fighting began Thursday, the two sides have been progressively involving heavier weapons, including artillery and rocket systems, with clashes expanding to 12 locations from six. Both blame the other side for starting the conflict, which Thailand\u2019s acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, warned Friday \u201ccould escalate into a state of war.\u201d",
      "At least 14 civilians and one member of the military have been killed on the Thai side, the Thai health ministry said Friday, and more than 130,000 Thai residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters. Cambodia reported one civilian death in the border area.",
      "Thailand has accused Cambodia of deliberately targeting civilians, while Cambodia accuses Thailand of using widely prohibited cluster munitions. On Thursday, Thailand, which has a far superior military, used a U.S.-made F-16 fighter jet to carry out an airstrike on a Cambodian military target.",
      "The U.S., a longtime treaty ally of Thailand, has called for an \u201cimmediate cessation\u201d of attacks.",
      "\u201cWe are particularly alarmed by reports of harm to innocent civilians,\u201d the State Department said Thursday.",
      "A simmering conflict",
      "The conflict has its roots in the disputed 500-mile border drawn largely by France, Cambodia\u2019s colonial ruler until 1953. Cambodia and Thailand have fought several deadly skirmishes since the border was delineated in 1907, particularly in the area surrounding the ancient 11th-century Hindu temple of Preah Vihear, which both sides claim as their own but was affirmed as Cambodian by the International Court of Justice in 1962 and again in 2013. Thailand rejects the court\u2019s jurisdiction.",
      "The temple\u2019s listing as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008 prompted another flare-up.",
      "Tensions have been building again since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed after both sides opened fire in another contested area where the two meet with Laos, called the Emerald Triangle. Then on Wednesday, five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion along the border, which kicked off the latest clash. Cambodia denies placing landmines.",
      "A series of tit-for-tat moves followed, including both countries expelling each other\u2019s diplomats.",
      "\u201cThe two sides are now at the point of almost no return,\u201d Pou Sothirak, a former Cambodian ambassador to Japan and a Distinguished Senior Adviser to the Cambodian Center for Regional Studies in Phnom Penh, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve locked into this \u2018we\u2019re the victim and you\u2019re the aggressor\u2019 narrative,\u201d he said.",
      "Political fallout",
      "The dispute has set off political turmoil in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended early this month after an extraordinary leak of her phone call with Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia for almost four decades as effectively a one-party state before handing power to his son Hun Manet two years ago.",
      "The father still maintains his grip over Cambodian affairs, which apparently prompted the call by Paetongtarn, 38, whose father, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was known to be close to the 72-year-old Hun Sen. She has said she was trying to defuse the border dispute in the call, during which she referred to Hun Sen as \u201cuncle.\u201d",
      "The conversation, recorded and released by Hun Sen himself, prompted outrage in Thailand, where there was already widespread dissatisfaction with her handling of the border dispute.",
      "Paetongtarn also blasted a Thai army commander during the call, angering an institution that has frequently intervened in the country\u2019s politics, experts said.",
      "\u201cWe have a situation today in which the Thai military is making its own foreign policy against Cambodia. The Thai civilian government has no control over the army at all,\u201d said Paul Wesley Chambers, a visiting fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s free for all and really out of control,\u201d he said of the situation this week, adding that the conflict could topple Phumtham as Thailand\u2019s acting prime minister.",
      "Cambodia said it had urged the United Nations Security Council to intervene in Thailand\u2019s \u201cunprovoked and premeditated military aggression.\u201d Thailand says it wants to resolve the conflict bilaterally, but only after Cambodia ceases its attacks.",
      "Neighboring China has offered mediation, but it is seen as closer to the government in Phnom Penh than Bangkok.",
      "Negotiating an end is going to be a challenge for both sides, Pou said, as the Thai military\u2019s effective self-governance has created a diplomatic hole between Thailand and Cambodia, which in the past has undermined the possibility of a permanent end to the border dispute.",
      "\u201cThe Thai military preemptively pressures conflicts,\u201d he said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republican leaders are facing growing calls from their members to extend a bucket of funding for the Affordable Care Act that is slated to expire at the end of this year as some look to avert insurance premium hikes and millions of Americans losing health coverage.",
      "But the cause faces opposition from conservatives who detest \u201cObamacare,\u201d as the law is nicknamed, and don\u2019t want to lift a finger to protect it. Some argue it\u2019d be too expensive to continue the premium tax credits, which cost over $30 billion per year and were initially adopted as part of a Covid-19 response.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that about 5 million Americans will lose their insurance by 2034 if the money expires.",
      "Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., the chair of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said \u201ca lot of people\u201d are discussing how to address the ACA subsidies. But the party is torn.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying where I am on that issue, but it\u2019s definitely part of the conversation,\u201d Smith told NBC News. \u201cThere\u2019s some interest to do something. There\u2019s some interest to do nothing. So it\u2019s threading that needle.\u201d",
      "Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., who represents a swing district that President Donald Trump lost in 2024, said in an interview that Congress should continue those ACA tax credits in order to avoid price increases.",
      "He said he\u2019s involved in an effort to offer a legislative fix.",
      "\u201cI think we gotta be doing everything to keep costs low across the board \u2014 health care, groceries, energy, all of the above. So I am currently working on addressing that as we speak,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump pollster warns of 'political penalty'",
      "Last week, Trump\u2019s longtime pollster Tony Fabrizio co-authored a memo with Bob Ward warning that extending the health care tax credits is broadly popular, even with \u201csolid majorities of Trump voters and Swing voters.\u201d They warned that the GOP will pay a \u201cpolitical penalty\u201d in the competitive districts in the 2026 midterm elections if the funding expires on schedule.",
      "It\u2019s not just centrists or Republicans in competitive areas who want to keep the funds flowing. The appetite has grown among others in deep-red states as insurers threaten to raise premiums in anticipation of the funds going away.",
      "GOP Sen. Mike Rounds, who faces re-election next year in ruby-red South Dakota, also backed the idea.",
      "\u201cI think that they should be extended. I think there\u2019s plans in place right now to try to extend them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal would be to try to find some offsets that would be amenable to Democrats as well. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the people that have been stuck with Obamacare and have no place else to go.\u201d",
      "Rounds said he expects GOP support to grow for a path that \u201ctakes care of these folks that literally have no place else to go to get their health insurance.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey would be losing it through no fault of their own,\u201d he said.",
      "The funds were adopted by Democrats as part of a Covid-19 stimulus bill in 2021 and extended the following year through 2025. This policy seeks to address the \u201csubsidy cliff\u201d where ACA funding dries up for people above 400% of the federal poverty level. The subsidy enhancement caps premiums at 8.5% of income for individuals and families above that level.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chair of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d wants that funding to end.",

      "GOP proponents say there are other opportunities to extend the funds \u2014 including a stand-alone bill or a year-end package of various health care provisions and tax extenders. One thing is clear: Republicans will need Democratic support, given the divisions in their own ranks. And they may need to modify the existing version to make it palatable in the party.",

      "Federal government regulators approve an $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance. Jerome Powell pushes back during Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the Federal Reserve\u2019s headquarters. And the woman behind the viral \u201cJet2 holiday\u201d soundbite is surprised at its popularity.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know today.",
      "Paramount\u2019s $8 billion merger with Skydance is approved",
      "The Federal Communications Commission said it had approved Skydance Media\u2019s $8 billion bid to acquire CBS News parent company Paramount after Skydance made several concessions to the Trump administration. The merger paves the way for a tectonic shift in ownership of one of America\u2019s three major networks. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in a news release that the move would bring change to CBS News\u2019 coverage, claiming \u201cAmericans no longer trust legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly.\u201d",
      "Among the concessions that Skydance made with regulators was an agreement to not implement any DEI programs. The company also said it would \u201cundertake a comprehensive review\u201d of CBS and install an ombudsman for at least two years who will consider \u201ccomplaints of bias\u201d at CBS News. Other companies that have billion-dollar transactions pending before the FCC have also backed off DEI programs, including Verizon and T-Mobile.",

      "Earlier this month, Paramount Global settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $16 million over a lawsuit in which he alleged that the way CBS edited a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris was \u201celection and voter interference.\u201d",
      "And last week, CBS announced it was canceling \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d currently hosted by Stephen Colbert, who had recently criticized the settlement. CBS said the cancellation was \u201cpurely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\u201d",
      "The lone Democrat in FCC leadership, Commissioner Anna Gomez, criticized the Trump administration\u2019s push to secure promises from companies, including anti-DEI measures. \u201cEven more alarming,\u201d Gomez said in an emailed statement, the FCC \u201cis now imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law.\u201d",
      "In addition to CBS News, Paramount\u2019s assets include Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, The CW, MTV, BET and several film franchises. Hours after Paramount announced Wednesday that the creators of \u201cSouth Park\u201d agreed to produce 50 new episodes in a deal reportedly valued at $1.5 billion, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker excoriated the company and aggressively skewered Trump in the premiere episode of the Comedy Central show.",

      "Trump visited the Federal Reserve\u2019s headquarters amid ongoing renovations at the building, where ongoing renovations have served as the administration\u2019s latest possible pretext for removing Fed Chair Jerome Powell from his post. Wearing a hard hat, the president said the construction cost had ballooned to \u201cabout $3.1 billion,\u201d up from $2.5 billion. But Powell, standing next to Trump, retorted, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that.\u201d After Trump handed him a piece of paper, Powell said the elevated cost Trump was citing included of a 5-year-old project.",
      "Trump\u2019s visit to the Federal Reserve was notable not only because of his apparent dissatisfaction toward Powell\u2019s refusal to lower interest rates, but also for its rarity. The last president to visit the Fed headquarters was George W. Bush in 2006. Before that, Gerald Ford visited in 1975, and Franklin D. Roosevelt inaugurated the building in 1937.",
      "Trump, who as recently as last week suggested he might fire Powell, told reporters yesterday, \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary\u201d to fire him. When asked if there was anything Powell could do to get Trump to \u201cback off,\u201d Trump said, \u201clower rates,\u201d as he slapped Powell\u2019s back in a friendly manner.

      "A simmering conflict",
      "The conflict has its roots in the disputed 500-mile border drawn largely by France, Cambodia\u2019s colonial ruler until 1953. Cambodia and Thailand have fought several deadly skirmishes since the border was delineated in 1907, particularly in the area surrounding the ancient 11th-century Hindu temple of Preah Vihear, which both sides claim as their own but was affirmed as Cambodian by the International Court of Justice in 1962 and again in 2013.

      "The father still maintains his grip over Cambodian affairs, which apparently prompted the call by Paetongtarn, 38, whose father, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was known to be close to the 72-year-old Hun Sen. She has said she was trying to defuse the border dispute in the call, during which she referred to Hun Sen as \u201cuncle.\u201d",
      "The conversation, recorded and released by Hun Sen himself, prompted outrage in Thailand, where there was already widespread dissatisfaction with her handling of the border dispute.",
      "Paetongtarn also blasted a Thai army commander during the call, angering an institution that has frequently intervened in the country\u2019s politics, experts said.",
      "\u201cWe have a situation today in which the Thai military is making its own foreign policy against Cambodia. The Thai civilian government has no control over the army at all,\u201d said Paul Wesley Chambers, a visiting fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.",

      "Neighboring China has offered mediation, but it is seen as closer to the government in Phnom Penh than Bangkok.",
      "Negotiating an end is going to be a challenge for both sides, Pou said, as the Thai military\u2019s effective self-governance has created a diplomatic hole between Thailand and Cambodia, which in the past has undermined the possibility of a permanent end to the border dispute.",

      "It\u2019s not just centrists or Republicans in competitive areas who want to keep the funds flowing. The appetite has grown among others in deep-red states as insurers threaten to raise premiums in anticipation of the funds going away.",

      "\u201cI think that they should be extended. I think there\u2019s plans in place right now to try to extend them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal would be to try to find some offsets that would be amenable to Democrats as well. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the people that have been stuck with Obamacare and have no place else to go.\u201d",

    "summary": "Former Obama aides say they have to balance between unnecessarily giving oxygen to unfounded Trump administration claims and allowing them to balloon unchecked.",
    "story": [
      "To former aides who worked in Barack Obama\u2019s White House, the Trump administration\u2019s allegations of \u201ctreason\u201d carried the stench of desperation from a president straining to shift the focus from a burgeoning scandal around Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Still, they\u2019re grappling with how to contain the unprecedented accusations National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard has leveled, even as they dismiss them as asinine, interviews with more than half a dozen people who worked in Obama\u2019s White House or on his campaigns reveal.",
      "These people say the events of the last week have turned into a messaging balancing act between unnecessarily giving oxygen to the claims that Obama ordered a false intelligence analysis to show Russia had worked to help Trump win the 2016 election and leaving the potential for unchecked accusations to balloon. Many of those who talked to NBC News were not authorized to speak publicly about strategy.",
      "\u201cThe battle now is to play this even to make sure that thoughts don\u2019t start to creep into more mainstream\u201d audiences, a former Obama administration official said. That person said it was important to reach \"mainstream Republicans,\" who would listen to editorial boards and those in Congress who deemed the allegations against Obama as \"beyond the pale.\"",
      "Some expressed uncertainty over what to expect next from Trump or his lieutenants, charging that the administration could grow more bullish to draw attention away from a string of explosive Epstein stories that Trump is struggling to tamp down. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but it has said there is merit to accusations around Obama.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what is ahead, and I don\u2019t know what their plans and intentions are,\u201d John Brennan, who was CIA director in the Obama administration, told NBC News. \u201cI just find all of this very troubling when it is being done by individuals who serve in such important positions and know what they are doing is wrong.\u201d",
      "Former National Intelligence Director James Clapper echoed Brennan\u2019s ambiguity over the Trump administration\u2019s intentions, telling CNN he would \u201clawyer up.\u201d",
      "National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe leveled claims last week that Obama administration officials manipulated intelligence and conspired to undermine the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s electoral victory in 2016. Gabbard posted on social media last Friday that she was making a criminal referral to the Justice Department. Then, this week, she stepped up publicity around the accusations from the White House briefing room.",
      "Broadly, the former Obama aides unequivocally say that there is zero merit to the allegations and that they do not believe they will lead anywhere. They point to a 2020 Senate investigation, which endorsed intelligence agencies\u2019 assessment that Russia had spread disinformation online and leaked stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 candidacy and help Trump. Trump-appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio was the acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time, which endorsed the findings.",
      "\u201cThere is no factual basis for the allegations that Tulsi Gabbard is making. She\u2019s cherry-picking things from various documents that are out of context and mischaracterized,\u201d Brennan said.",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s clear either she has not read the intelligence community assessment or she is purposely, willfully lying about the contents,\u201d he added.",
      "Obama allies also say the timing of the allegations is suspect. They emerged as Trump has struggled to contend with his own base after his administration announced it would not release more documents tied to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who faced a litany of allegations of abuse of underage women before he died by suicide.",
      "On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch, reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump in May that his name appears in the Epstein files \u2014 even though he told reporters this month that Bondi had not informed him that he was named.",
      "In the midst of a firestorm Trump has yet to shake, the administration brought out the allegations against Obama. Over the weekend, Trump reposted a fake AI-generated video of Obama being arrested on social media.",
      "Once Gabbard used the word \u201ctreason,\u201d Obama\u2019s team ramped up its messaging, leading Obama's spokesperson to release a carefully worded statement. It denounced Gabbard\u2019s accusations without mentioning Epstein, because it was \u201cbelow the dignity of the former president,\u201d a former Obama administration official said.",
      "\u201cOut of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response,\u201d Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement this week. \u201cBut these claims are outrageous enough to merit one. These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\"",
      "Ned Price, who held roles under Obama as a special assistant to the president, a National Security Council senior director and spokesperson and as a CIA senior analyst under Obama and George W. Bush, said he believed it was imperative to reach conservative audiences with a response. On Wednesday, he wrote an opinion piece for Fox News titled: \u201cAmericans should beware of Gabbard\u2019s \u2018dangerous distraction\u2019 with revisionist history of 2016 election.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a piece I would have written for any mainstream or left-of-center outlet. This was designed solely and exclusively for Fox News, because that\u2019s where this fire of disinformation is raging,\u201d Price said in an interview. \u201cI thought it was important ... to inject facts into that very venue in the hope that at least a few people would read it and be exposed to what actually transpired in 2016.\u201d"

      "Christopher Earl Lloyd, 39, of Orange County, is accused of executing the scheme from April 2021 until February 2024, according to the indictment, released Thursday by the Justice Department in the Central District of California.",
      "The indictment accuses Lloyd of using dating apps \u2014\u00a0like Tinder, Hinge and Bumble \u2014 \"to befriend and engage in romantic relationships with victims,\" whom he then lied to about his finances and career to get them to invest their money with him. When they sent him cash, he used it for his \"personal benefit,\" according to the federal indictment.",
      "Lloyd told the victims that he had recently closed on multiple properties, that he had been a finance manager for years, that he was vice president of a company called 13 Holdings and that he worked for an investment company called Landmark Holdings \u2014 none of which was true, the indictment alleges.",
      "He convinced his victims that he was knowledgeable about investments and encouraged them to send him their money for him to invest, according to the indictment.",
      "The indictment alleges he promised that his victims would see \"regular returns\" on the money invested with him and that their investments were \"insured up to a significant amount.\" He also told them they could withdraw their funds at any time, the indictment says.",
      "To legitimize the process, Lloyd signed contracts that \"specified the investments that the victims were to make\" and created \"a false schedule of returns on their investments,\" the indictment alleges. His victims sent money to a number of bank accounts he owned via wire, Zelle and Cash App or by using cash, it says.",
      "\"Rather than using the victims' funds for investments, defendant Lloyd largely spent it for his own personal benefit,\" the indictment says, including a 2023 incident in which he used $40,000 of his victims' money to write a check to a Lexus dealership in Southern California.",
      "The federal indictment lists at least five victims who it says, on multiple occasions, wired Lloyd amounts that ranged from $15,500 to $110,000. In total, Lloyd collected more than $2 million from his victims through the scheme, it says.",
      "Lloyd was charged with 13 counts of wire fraud and one count of engaging in a monetary transaction in property derived from the fraud, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office said in a release.",
      "He made an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana on Thursday afternoon and remains in federal custody.",
      "A lawyer representing Lloyd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If he is convicted, Lloyd would face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each of the 13 wire fraud counts and up to 10 years in prison for the monetary transaction count.",

    "summary": "Former Jan. 6 proseuctor Mike Gordon and other DOJ employees who were fired are suing the Trump adminstration.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0It was late afternoon on the last Friday in June, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Gordon was in his office in Tampa, Florida, interviewing a victim for an upcoming trial via Zoom.",
      "Alongside a special agent, Gordon was preparing the victim to be a witness in a Justice Department case against a lawyer who the Justice Department alleged had been scamming clients.",
      "There was a knock at the door, Gordon later told NBC News, and he didn\u2019t answer; at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida, there was a culture of not just popping in when the door is closed. But the door popped open, and there stood the office manager, ashen-faced.",
      "The office manager is in charge of security, and Gordon thought for a moment that something might have happened to his family. Gordon muted the Zoom call, and the office manager handed him a piece of paper.",
      "It was a one-page letter signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi. He'd been terminated from federal service.",
      "\"No explanation. No advance warning. No description of what the cause was,\" Gordon said in an interview. \"Now, I knew why. I knew it had to be my Jan. 6 work.\"",
      "Gordon had been senior trial counsel in the Capitol Siege Section of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, which prosecuted alleged rioters involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. His title reflected some of the high-profile cases he'd taken on during the Jan. 6 investigation and the role he played in helping other federal prosecutors.",
      "At the time of his firing, Gordon had long been working on other cases back home in Florida. He had recently been assigned to co-lead a case against two people accused of stealing more than $100 million from a medical trust for people with disabilities, as well as injured workers and retirees. Just two days before he was fired, he'd received an \"outstanding\" rating on his performance review.",
      "Now, along with two other recently fired Justice Department employees, Gordon is pushing back, suing the Trump administration late Thursday over their dismissals. The suit argues that the normal procedures federal employees are expected to go through to address their grievances \u2014 the Merit Systems Protection Board \u2014 are fundamentally broken because of the Trump administration's actions.",
      "MSPB is a quasi-judicial body that is meant to settle disputes between employees and their agencies, but the suit argues it \"cannot function as intended\" because of President Donald Trump's firing of MSPB member Cathy Harris. A federal court issued a permanent injunction reinstating Harris, but the Supreme Court stayed the injunction, allowing Harris' removal. Now the MSPB lacks a quorum to vote on any petitions for review, while MSPB administrative judges are \"overwhelmed\" because of the government's termination of thousands of federal employees.",
      "Gordon filed the lawsuit alongside Patricia Hartman, who was a top spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, and Joseph Tirrell, who was director of the Departmental Ethics Office, before the Trump administration dismissed them this year. Tirrell, an FBI and Navy veteran, had 19 years of federal civil service, along with six years of military service, when he was fired.",
      "Hartman, who had worked for various Justice Department components for almost two decades, oversaw news releases and media responses related to the Jan. 6 prosecutions, which was the largest investigation in FBI history, involving more than 1,500 defendants.",
      "\u201cI was never given an explanation for my termination,\" Hartman told NBC News. \"Based on my performance reviews, which have always been outstanding, I have to believe that something else was driving this. The bottom line is this, in my mind, amounts to psychological terrorism. You are removing people who were good or excellent at their jobs with no explanation.\u201d",
      "The lawyers on the lawsuit are Abbe Lowell, Norm Eisen, Heidi Burakiewicz and Mark Zaid, a whistleblower attorney who has been targeted by the Trump administration, which stripped his security clearance after Trump named him in an executive order. Zaid has since sued.",
      "The new administration has fired roughly 200 Justice Department employees, according to Justice Connection, an organization that was set up to support Justice Department employees.",
      "\"The way in which these employees have been terminated seems like a pretty clear violation of the Civil Service Protection Act and general constitutional due process protections, and it's been destabilizing for the workforce, because nobody knows when they're going to be next,\" said Stacy Young, a former Justice Department employee. \u201cI hear from employees all the time who tell me they wake up in the morning terrified that today will be their day. It feels to a lot of them like psychological warfare.\u201d",
      "Gordon was fired the same day two other Jan. 6 prosecutors were fired last month. He\u2019d started out as a state prosecutor in New York City and began his career as a federal prosecutor in January 2017, working in the violent crimes and narcotics section. When he saw what happened on Jan. 6 and the call go out within the Justice Department for assistance prosecuting those involved, he signed up, he told NBC News.",
      "Jason Manning, a former federal prosecutor who worked on Jan. 6 cases, as well, said Gordon executed back-to-back trials \"flawlessly\" and played a critical role in supporting others in the unit.",
      "\"On a large team of excellent and hard-working people, Mike really stood out as a leader on the team, as somebody who prosecuted some of the most notorious defendants and some of the most highly watched and high-pressure and critical cases,\" Manning said.",
      "Among them was the case against Ray Epps, who was the target of false conspiracy theories claiming he was a federal government plant, before he was eventually charged by federal prosecutors, who sought to send him to prison for six months. A judge ultimately sentenced Epps to probation, citing the impact the conspiracy theories had on his life.",
      "After Trump became the Republican presidential nominee last year, federal prosecutors working the Jan. 6 cases knew there was a risk to their work, and they made dark jokes about what could happen to them if Trump returned to office, multiple sources close to the Justice Department have told NBC News. Now, those fears have become a reality.",
      "When he returned to office, Trump quickly pardoned Jan. 6 defendants en masse, and probationary federal prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6 cases were fired, as were people who worked on special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigation of Trump. Current FBI employees who worked on the Smith and Jan. 6 probes still wonder what could happen to them down the road after the Justice Department demanded a list of employees who worked on those investigations.",
      "\"The people who volunteered for that detail are some of the best, smartest, most talented lawyers in the country,\" Gordon said, referring to Jan. 6 prosecutors. \"It's not that somehow the administration should just pat itself on the back and say, 'Great, like, these are all deep state Democrats that we're driving out.' That's not what's happening. They are either firing or pushing out some of the most talented people they have.\""

      "The Trump administration sued New York City on Thursday over its \u201csanctuary\u201d laws, continuing a monthslong effort to crack down on localities that try to shield undocumented immigrants from federal detainment efforts.",
      "\u201cNew York City has released thousands of criminals on the streets to commit violent crimes against law-abiding citizens due to sanctuary city policies. If New York City won\u2019t stand up for the safety of its citizens, we will,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said.",
      "Included in Trump\u2019s effort to drastically reduce the flow of unlawful immigration into the United States has been a concerted effort by his administration to crack down on so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, described as states, cities, counties or municipalities that enact laws that effectively prevent local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.",
      "The administration alleged New York's sanctuary city policies \u201cimpede the Federal Government\u2019s ability to enforce the federal immigration laws\u201d and \u201cviolate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew York City has long been at the vanguard of interfering with enforcing this country\u2019s immigration laws. Its history as a sanctuary city dates back to 1989, and its efforts to thwart federal immigration enforcement have only intensified since,\u201d the complaint reads.",
      "The Trump Justice Department, meanwhile, said the city\u2019s immigration policies have the \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d of making it more difficult for federal immigration officers to carry out their responsibilities.",
      "\u201cThese provisions intentionally obstruct the sharing of information envisioned and affirmatively protected by Congress, including sharing basic information such as release dates, court appearance dates, and custodial status,\u201d the complaint reads.",
      "Among the defendants named in the suit are New York Mayor Eric Adams; City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, a former mayoral candidate; and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.",
      "In the suit, filed in the Eastern District of New York, the administration asks the court to declare that the city's laws violate the Supremacy Clause and are therefore invalid. The administration also asked the court to permanently prohibit the city's departments and officials from enforcing the sanctuary city policies.",
      "Mayor Adams had sought to establish a friendly relationship with administration officials, meeting with Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar,\u201d Tom Homan, before Trump's inauguration to discuss what he called a shared goal to remove violent immigrants from the city. Adams went as far as to publicly back a bill that would roll back parts of the city's sanctuary policies to better allow cooperation with the federal government, a move that ultimately would be up to the City Council to enact.",
      "Despite the early outreach, Homan this week sharpened his attacks on New York, which he has described as \"the biggest sanctuary city in this country,\" after an off-duty Customs and Border Protection agent was shot in the city. Several Trump administration officials, including Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, attributed the shooting to the city's sanctuary policies. City officials have detained a person of interest and said the shooting was an attempted robbery that did not appear to be connected to the victim's job.",
      "\"The sanctuary cities are now our priority. We're going to flood the zone,\" Homan said Monday. \"So sanctuary cities got exactly what they don't want: more agents in the community and more agents in the worksite.\"",
      "Adams said he \"will review the lawsuit\" in a statement on X that also reiterated his support for re-examining local ordinances on immigration.",
      "\"We support the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council \u2014 but I have also been clear that they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and have urged the Council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer,\" Adams said. \"So far, the Council has refused.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the city council said in a statement that city's law department is reviewing the lawsuit.",
      "\"Pam Bondi may want to distract from reality, but the facts are clear: the evidence consistently shows that cities with sanctuary laws are safer than those without them,\" the spokesperson said. \"When residents feel comfortable reporting crime and cooperating with local law enforcement, we are all safer, something both Republican and Democratic mayors of New York City have recognized. It is the Trump Administration indiscriminately targeting people at civil court hearings, detaining high schoolers, and separating families that make our city and nation less safe.\"",
      "The city Corrections Department, the city Probation Department and the police department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Across both of his presidential terms, Trump has threatened to withhold federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions and prosecute state or local officials who impede enforcement actions to varying degrees of success.",
      "In January, Trump signed an executive order directing Noem and Bondi to ensure sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to federal funds\" and to consider pursuing criminal or civil penalties if localities \"interfere with the enforcement of Federal law.\"",
      "A federal judge in April blocked the effort to withhold federal funds, finding that Trump's order violated the Constitution's separation of powers principles. The same judge blocked a similar effort by Trump in 2017.",
      "The administration sued the state of New York this year over its \u201cGreen Light Law,\u201d which allows the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants and limits the sharing of related data with federal immigration authorities. In addition, the law requires state officials to notify license holders when their information is requested. The Justice Department is seeking to have the law declared unlawful and unenforceable.",
      "In addition to New York, the Trump administration has targeted other Democratic-leaning communities over policies it alleges impede federal authorities' ability to enforce immigration laws.",
      "The administration sued the state of Illinois and city of Chicago in February, seeking to block the enforcement of a law that bars state and local law enforcement agencies from assisting the federal government with civil immigration enforcement absent a criminal warrant.",
      "In June, the administration sued the city of Los Angeles over its immigration laws, arguing that they interfere and discriminate against federal agents by treating them differently from other law enforcement agents in California by restricting access to property and individual detainees. In the suit, the administration pointed to the laws as being behind recent clashes between federal immigration officials and protesters in Los Angeles last month."

      "Trump administration regulators have approved Skydance Media\u2019s $8 billion bid to acquire CBS News parent company Paramount, paving the way for a tectonic shift in ownership of one of America\u2019s three major networks.",
      "The Federal Communications Commission said Thursday that it had approved the acquisition, with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr adding in a news release that the move would bring change to the company's news coverage. Paramount owns CBS, which includes CBS News.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,\" Carr said. \"That is why I welcome Skydance\u2019s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.  In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company\u2019s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.\"",
      "\"Today\u2019s decision also marks another step forward in the FCC\u2019s efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI discrimination,\" Carr added.",
      "In recent days, Paramount's new owner made a number of concessions to the FCC, including agreeing to not implement any diversity, equity or inclusion programs. Skydance also said it would \"undertake a comprehensive review\" of CBS and \"will commit, for a period of at least two years, to have in place an ombudsman.\" That role would report to the president of the new company.",
      "A number of companies that have billion-dollar transactions pending before Carr's FCC have also backed off of DEI programs, including Verizon and T-Mobile.",
      "The concessions also came after Paramount Global settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $16 million. Trump brought that suit, saying the way CBS edited a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris was \"election and voter interference.\"",
      "The lone Democrat in FCC leadership, Commissioner Anna Gomez, did not mince words about the push to secure promises from the companies.",
      "\u201cAfter months of cowardly capitulation to this Administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted,\" she said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,\" she added. \"Once again, this agency is undermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity by overstepping its authority and intervening in employment matters reserved for other government entities with proper jurisdiction on these issues.\"",
      "\"Even more alarming, it is now imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law.\"",
      "Skydance is run by David Ellison, son of Oracle founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison. While the younger Ellison made a donation to President Joe Biden\u2019s re-election fund in February 2024 shortly before the former president bowed out of the race, Trump recently signaled his comfort with his takeover of Paramount and its assets, which in addition to CBS News  include Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, The CW, MTV, BET and film franchises like \u201cSmurfs\u201d and \u201cSonic the Hedgehog.\u201d",
      "\u201cEllison is great. He\u2019ll do a great job with it,\u201d Trump said in June.",
      "There is likely to be a sea change in the editorial direction of CBS News under its new ownership. In a recent filing, Ellison and Skydance said they\u2019d told Carr that they were committed to pursuing a focus on \u201cAmerican storytelling\u201d while touting a new, \u201cunbiased\u201d editorial direction for CBS News. Their meeting came shortly after Paramount agreed to settle Trump\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "It also came just days after CBS announced it was canceling \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d currently hosted by Stephen Colbert \u2014 an announcement Trump praised on social media. Colbert had recently criticized the parent company\u2019s multimillion-dollar settlement with Trump, while CBS said the cancellation was \u201cpurely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\u201d",
      "There had been signs of an editorial shift ahead of the merger. Most notably, longtime \u201c60 Minutes\u201d editor Bill Owens announced he was stepping down this spring, citing CBS News\u2019 fading editorial independence. Shortly after, CBS News President and CEO Wendy McMahon was pushed out. Last week, The New York Times reported Skydance was in early talks to acquire the conservative-leaning The Free Press media outlet. Meanwhile, \u201cDaily Show\u201d host Jon Stewart has said he did not know whether his program would survive the merger.",
      "Skydance has spent years pursuing Paramount and eventually realized it could successfully execute the transaction by purchasing Paramount\u2019s parent, National Amusements, the company once helmed by Sumner Redstone, the father of the company\u2019s current chairwoman, president and CEO, Shari Redstone. Yet the proposed deal continued to face hurdles, first under the Biden administration then at the outset of Trump\u2019s term. Its approval came in what was its third deadline extension period."

      "As a mom of two \u2014 ages 3.5 and 9 months \u2014 with a surprise third baby on the way, I\u2019ve hit full-on panic mode about managing outings with three kids in tow. I\u2019m not just talking about family vacations. I mean errands, park trips or dragging everyone to the pediatrician without losing my mind (or a shoe).",

I folded, unfolded, packed trunks, walked the dog, jogged city blocks and yes, juggled a baby while collapsing a stroller one-handed. Here are the ones that actually delivered.",
      "How I Tested Each Stroller",

      "The best compact strollers of 2025",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2",
      "The Bugaboo Butterfly 2 became my go-to for city errands and weekend outings. It folds with one hand (a lifesaver when you\u2019re holding a baby and wrangling toddler gear), fits easily into my trunk and has a basket big enough for my oversized diaper bag and snacks. The extended hood provides actual shade, not just a strip of fabric, and the peekaboo window lets me check in on the baby without disrupting nap time. It\u2019s smooth, thoughtfully designed and easy to love \u2014 but it is definitely on the pricier side.",
      "Colugo Compact Stroller",
      "This modern stroller understands the assignment. The one-handed, two-second fold fits in airplane bins, which is a dream when juggling travel gear. My 9-month-old naps easily thanks to the multi-position recline and canopy, while the adjustable calf rest works well for my toddler. The ride is smooth, and the deep storage basket carries everything I need. However, the brake is a little too easy to trigger accidentally with longer legs, and it\u2019s not newborn-ready unless you purchase the bassinet separately.",
      "Doona Infant Car Seat & Stroller",
      "A favorite among new parents for a reason, the Doona transitions from car seat to stroller in seconds. It\u2019s a travel game-changer, especially when your baby falls asleep in the car and you don\u2019t want to wake them. It\u2019s also a space-saver for tight elevators and restaurants. That said, it\u2019s heavy and has a short shelf life \u2014 once your baby outgrows the infant stage, it\u2019s done.",
      "DFY R1 Stroller",
      "This one earned my husband\u2019s rare stamp of approval. With a height-adjustable handle, both of us can push comfortably. The seat reclines fully and grows with your child without the need for inserts. The magnetic buckle feels secure and prevents accidental pinches. While the design is sleek and the ride is sturdy, folding it takes some practice and it\u2019s too bulky for air travel.",
      "Silver Cross Jet\u202f5 Stroller",
      "If you\u2019re a frequent flyer, this one\u2019s for you. The Jet 5 folds into a suitcase shape and stands on its own, perfect for gate-checking or tucking into overhead bins. My baby naps well in the lie-flat seat and the generous canopy helps with sleep on the go. It\u2019s sleek, light and feels luxe, though the storage is minimal and add-on accessories like snack trays and rain covers cost extra.",
      "Beberoad Love R1 Stroller",
      "This under-the-radar pick was a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s incredibly light but still stable over gravel and sidewalks. I was impressed by how secure my 9-month-old felt in the seat. It opens and closes easily, which makes errands faster. The brand is lesser-known and details can be sparse, and while it\u2019s great for babies, it won\u2019t work for my toddler due to weight limits.",
      "UPPAbaby Minu V3 Stroller",
      "This one feels like the luxury sedan of compact strollers. It glides smoothly, folds easily and includes thoughtful features like a peekaboo canopy and adjustable calf rest. My toddler and baby are both comfortable in it, and the high-end finishes make it feel worth the splurge. Still, it\u2019s heavier than other models and lifting it while holding a baby takes effort.",
      "Nuna TRVL dubl Stroller",
      "Perfect for families with two stroller-aged kids. The narrow frame fits through standard doors and the fold is quick and easy. Both seats recline independently, and the canopies provide solid coverage. The biggest drawback? There\u2019s no way to add a third seat or board once baby number three arrives.",
      "Babyzen YOYO2 Stroller",
      "My most traveled stroller. It\u2019s been to Europe, Florida and back. It folds in a flash, fits in plane bins and handles tight city spaces with ease. I love that it transitions from newborn bassinet to toddler seat and can connect with another YOYO for a double setup. But between the limited storage, smaller canopy and the steep price (especially with accessories), it\u2019s definitely an investment.",
      "Valco Trend Duo Side by Side Double Stroller",
      "If you want a double stroller without pushing a tank, this is it. Each seat has plenty of space and coverage, and the ride is smoother than expected even over uneven ground. I can fit two diaper bags in the under-basket. The downside? The fold requires both hands, and it\u2019s too bulky for plane travel or tight entryways.",
      "Cybex Libelle 2 Stroller",
      "This is your \u201ckeep it in the trunk\u201d stroller. It folds down to almost nothing and is perfect for errands or quick trips. It can handle a baby and even a toddler for short rides, and it\u2019s car seat-compatible. Just don\u2019t expect it to conquer cobblestones or hold up to long walks.",
      "Zoe The Traveler",
      "This 13-lb stroller is surprisingly durable. It folds with one hand, the canopy provides solid shade and the magnetic harness makes buckling quick and painless. The leatherette accents give it a high-end feel without the high-end price. For all-day outings, though, I\u2019d recommend adding a seat liner for extra comfort and prepping for a slightly more involved cleanup routine.",
      "Guava Roam Stroller",
      "Think SUV in stroller form. The Guava Roam has a three-wheel design with extra large tires (14-inch rear, 12-inch front) that handle bumps, uneven sidewalks and grass effortlessly \u2014 it\u2019s ideal for joggers or anyone constantly on the move. The padded seat is comfortable for my baby even on long days out, and the deep storage means I don\u2019t need to carry an extra bag.",
      "NBC Select tech reporter Harry Rabinowitz also tested this stroller, and he found it perfectly met his need for a running stroller than folded compactly enough to fit through small doors and vestibules. \u201cWhile I haven\u2019t tested as many strollers as Becca, the Roam was the only stroller that checked all my boxes: safe for running and everyday use, a compact fold, a one-handed carry handle and ample underseat storage,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I can\u2019t imagine my routine without it.\u201d",

      "If you have wide feet, you are likely no stranger to the feeling of tightness and pinching that comes from a new pair of shoes.. But having wide feet shouldn\u2019t stop you from having your Cinderella moment. You may just need to focus on sneakers that have a wide width to find the perfect running or walking shoe.",
      "\u201cThe right shoe will feel comfortable, provide adequate space for your toes to move freely, and support your foot\u2019s natural shape and alignment,\u201d says Dr. Isaac Tabari, a board-certified foot and ankle doctor and owner of the NYC Podiatry Center of Excellence. Thankfully, there are plenty of sneaker brands \u2014 like New Balance, Hoka and Brooks \u2014 that make shoes specifically for people with wide feet.

      "How I picked the best sneakers for women with wide feet",
      "\u201cA wide width shoe offers more room throughout the entire shoe \u2014 including the toe box, midsole and heel,\u201d says Tabari. But with so many wide width sneakers on the market, it can be tough to know what to focus on when shopping. Here are the things podiatrists suggest paying close attention to:",
      "Support: The whole point of getting shoes wide enough for your feet is to make sure they\u2019re comfortable. So along with width look for shoes with arch support and a cushioned sole, says Tabari. You can also keep an eye out on whether or not the shoes are wide enough to accommodate orthotic inserts or insoles should you need them. \u201cThese features can help prevent injuries such as plantar fasciitis or stress fractures,\u201d says Tabari. Materials: Since the material of the shoes can impact your comfort, look for options with a flexible upper like knit or mesh. This will provide more room for wide feet to move and will prevent you from feeling restricted in your sneakers.Toe box: Some sneakers have more of a pointed toe. Podiatrists recommend avoiding these if you have wide feet, as they may pinch around your toes. Instead, look for shoes with a round, square or wide toe box. This will allow you the space you need for your toes to splay and spread without rubbing against the side of your sneakers and potentially causing blisters, says Dr. Alissa Kuizinas, a board-certified podiatrist in Boston.",

      "The best women\u2019s sneakers for wide feet",
      "To recommend the best women\u2019s wide sneakers for running and/or walking, I asked podiatrists to share their favorites and included NBC Select staff favorites that come in wide width, along with a few highly rated options.",
      "Hoka Clifton 9",
      "I have wide feet and these are my go-to sneakers \u2014 I\u2019ve run multiple half marathons and they have never felt tight or constrictive. Hoka is known for its shock-absorbing soles and supportive uppers. The toe box is nearly as wide as the rest of the shoe, so your toes have plenty of room to splay out. The shoe\u2019s bottom has a rocker shape for smoother heel-to-toe transitions and the upper is made from breathable mesh, according to the brand. This shoe is also available in a version for men.",
      "Ryka Devotion X Walking Shoe",
      "Featured in our roundup of the best walking shoes, this style from Ryka comes in a wide width and is an NBC Select staff favorite. \u201cI\u2019ve never had dedicated walking shoes before, and this pair from Ryka showed me just how much of a difference they can make,\u201d says Sadhana Daruvuri, former NBC Select social editor. She wears them while walking her dog, in the park or around New York City to run errands. \u201cEven when I\u2019m in them for hours, my feet still feel cushioned and comfortable.\u201d The lace-up sneakers are specifically designed around the shape of women\u2019s feet, so the brand gave them a narrower heel, a roomy toe box and soft cushioning in the midsole. They also have a grippy rubber outsole, arch support built into the insole and extra cushioning in the forefoot and heel.",
      "ASICS Women's Gel-Venture 10 Running Shoes",
      "At under $100, these sneakers are an affordable wide width option. They have a breathable mesh upper and gel technology in the heel to provide extra cushioning and comfort, according to the brand. The shoe, which has a 4.4-star average rating from over 400 reviews on Amazon, also has deep treads, making it a good running shoe for various environments \u2014 like parks, streets and trails.",
      "Skechers Go Walk Joy",
      "Skechers\u2019 slip-on walking sneakers are one of the more affordable options on my list and have a 4.5-star average rating from nearly 100,000 reviews on Amazon. They have a mesh upper so your feet don\u2019t get sweaty, lightweight cushioning and come in narrow, medium and wide widths. The sneakers also have flexible, grippy outsoles and memory foam insoles.",
      "Nike Women's Free Metcon 6 Training Shoes",
      "Though these sneakers don\u2019t technically come in a wide width, NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown vouches for the fact that they work on wider feet. \u201cMy feet are very flat and wide and these shoes leave lots of room for my toes,\u201d she says. \u201cI love how sturdy they feel for workouts and casual walks and the fact that they\u2019re also stylish is a major plus.\u201d The molded heel offers support and the breathable upper is lightweight, according to Nike.",
      "New Balance Women's 877 V1 Walking Shoe",
      "Like the running shoes from New Balance on my list, these walking sneakers come in wide and extra wide widths. They have a stylish vintage look, in my opinion, but deliver on comfort, too. They have a padded footbed and rubber sole for traction. They are also reinforced around the ankle for extra support as you walk, according to the brand.",
      "Saucony Integrity Walker 3",
      "Another pick from our best walking shoes roundup, these shoes are a supportive stability shoe that help people who overpronate. The sneaker has a light, springy feel, according to the brand, a cushioned insole and a rubber outsole. Not only does this shoe come in wide widths, it is available in an extra wide width, too. The shoe also has a leather upper that looks crisp and is highly durable, according to Saucony.",
      "New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v13",
      "Tabari likes New Balance sneakers for those with wide feet because they offer both a wide width and an extra wide width. These sneakers have the brand\u2019s Fresh Foam X midsole to provide extra cushioning without increasing the weight of the shoe, according to the brand. They have a rocker profile to propel you forward and a rubber sole for traction. The shoe also goes up to a size 13 for those with larger feet.",
      "Altra FWD Experience Road Running Shoe",
      "These shoes don\u2019t technically come in a wide width, but they are designed with a wide toe box, says Kuizinas. Similar to the sneakers from Hoka, these have a rocker-shaped sole that helps to propel you forward as you run and the soles are made with compression foam for comfort. The upper is made with a flexible and breathable mesh material.",
      "Mizuno Women's Wave Inspire 18 Running Shoe",
      "This sneaker made our list of best running shoes thanks to the durability of its carbon rubber outer and cushioned sole. The shoe comes in both regular and wide widths and goes up to a size 12. The heel of this shoe contains Mizuno\u2019s energy foam, which provides cushioning and energy return, according to the brand. The upper is seamless to prevent rubbing and friction as you move.",
      "What happens when shoes aren\u2019t wide enough for your feet?",
      "When your shoes aren\u2019t wide enough to accommodate your feet, a number of problems can arise. First, you\u2019ll likely get blisters where the shoe rubs against your feet. Shoes that are too narrow can also put unnecessary pressure on your feet. \u201cWide shoes provide more room for the toes to spread out naturally, reducing pressure and friction on the toes and forefoot,\u201d says Tabari. \u201cTight shoes can restrict blood flow to the toes, leading to discomfort and even potential circulation issues.\u201d Other issues caused by shoes that aren\u2019t wide though include ingrown toenails, bunions and cramping.",
      "When walking or running in shoes that are too narrow for your feet, you may also start overcompensating to avoid discomfort, says Kuizinas. This can lead to back pain, rolling your ankle or a number of other injuries.",
      "How to tell if your shoes are too narrow",
      "Not sure if your sneakers are wide enough for your feet? \u201cIf you experience any rubbing on the big toe or pinky, your shoes are too narrow,\u201d says Kuizinas. \u201cYou should be able to wiggle your toes properly in your shoe.\u201d Another area where people commonly notice discomfort in narrow shoes is across the middle of the foot. If your foot feels cramped or the upper feels too tight there, you need a wider width.",

      "At NBC Select, we work with experts with specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and experience. We also ensure all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and without undisclosed financial conflicts of interest.",

      "Christopher Earl Lloyd, 39, of Orange County, is accused of executing the scheme from April 2021 until February 2024, according to the indictment, released Thursday by the Justice Department in the Central District of California.",
      "The indictment accuses Lloyd of using dating apps \u2014\u00a0like Tinder, Hinge and Bumble \u2014 \"to befriend and engage in romantic relationships with victims,\" whom he then lied to about his finances and career to get them to invest their money with him. When they sent him cash, he used it for his \"personal benefit,\" according to the federal indictment.",
      "Lloyd told the victims that he had recently closed on multiple properties, that he had been a finance manager for years, that he was vice president of a company called 13 Holdings and that he worked for an investment company called Landmark Holdings \u2014 none of which was true, the indictment alleges.",
      "He convinced his victims that he was knowledgeable about investments and encouraged them to send him their money for him to invest, according to the indictment.",
      "The indictment alleges he promised that his victims would see \"regular returns\" on the money invested with him and that their investments were \"insured up to a significant amount.\" He also told them they could withdraw their funds at any time, the indictment says.",
      "To legitimize the process, Lloyd signed contracts that \"specified the investments that the victims were to make\" and created \"a false schedule of returns on their investments,\" the indictment alleges. His victims sent money to a number of bank accounts he owned via wire, Zelle and Cash App or by using cash, it says.",
      "\"Rather than using the victims' funds for investments, defendant Lloyd largely spent it for his own personal benefit,\" the indictment says, including a 2023 incident in which he used $40,000 of his victims' money to write a check to a Lexus dealership in Southern California.",
      "The federal indictment lists at least five victims who it says, on multiple occasions, wired Lloyd amounts that ranged from $15,500 to $110,000. In total, Lloyd collected more than $2 million from his victims through the scheme, it says.",
      "Lloyd was charged with 13 counts of wire fraud and one count of engaging in a monetary transaction in property derived from the fraud, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office said in a release.",
      "He made an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana on Thursday afternoon and remains in federal custody.",
      "A lawyer representing Lloyd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "Payne keeps motioning for the audience to give it their all while he returns to his seat. As the final lines of the chorus play, he jumps up and down, beaming.",
      "When the song ends, Scherzinger turns to him and says, \u201cThat was awesome!\u201d",
      "He gives her a high five and replies, \u201cThat was so fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuilding the Band\u201d was Payne\u2019s final television appearance prior to falling to his death from a third floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Oct. 16 at the age of 31. The series previously addressed his untimely passing and honored his memory in the premiere. The show opened with a poignant message from host and Backstreet Boy AJ McLean.",
      "\u201cWhen we came together to film \u2018Building the Band,\u2019 we never imagined we\u2019d soon be saying goodbye to our friend, Liam Payne,\u201d McLean said. \u201cLiam is a guest judge in later episodes, and through his presence, we see his deep love for music and his unwavering commitment to helping others find their voice.\u201d",
      "The show included a photo and video montage from Payne\u2019s time on set before the Backstreet Boy member added, \u201cIt\u2019s through that spirit that we dedicate this series to Liam and his family.\u201d",
      "McLean also praised Payne during an interview with TODAY.com in which he spoke about their time working on the show together.",
      "\u201cHe lit up any room that he walked into,\u201d McLean recalled. \u201cWhether it was a dressing room, on set, where he was, he lit up that space with his energy, with his open heart, open mind. He was extremely, very well spoken, very articulate when it came to giving feedback as a mentor to these groups.\u201d",
      "He also complimented Payne for being \u201cvery supportive, rigorously honest in a compassionate way\u201d and \u201cthe coolest dude\u201d on the set."

    "story": [
      "Warning: Major spoilers ahead for \"The Buccaneers\" Season 2, Episode 6, \"Every Single Piece of My Heart.\"",
      "\"The Buccaneers\" \u2014 a historical fiction drama following a rambunctious group of American girls taking on London's high society in the 1870s \u2014 just introduced a dark twist.",
      "So far, Season 2 has stayed true to form in chronicling the dramatics of the core group, made up of Nan (Kristine Froseth), Jinny (Imogen Waterhouse), Conchita (Alisha Boe), Mabel (Josie Totah) and Lizzy (Aubri Ibrag).",
      "Mabel has been living with Conchita and her husband, Lord Richard Marable (Josh Dylan). Nan has been struggling to enjoy her marriage with Theo, the Duke of Tintagel (Guy Remmers), due to her lingering feelings for Guy Thwarte (Matthew Broome). And Lizzy has been conducting a secret affair with Theo amid her own engagement to Hector Robinson (Jacob Ifan).",
      "Meanwhile, Jinny, after escaping from her abusive husband, Lord James Seadown (Barney Fishwick), at the end of Season 1, has been hiding in Italy with her newborn son under Guy's protection.",
      "\"I think she feels really lonely and isolated,\" Waterhouse tells TODAY.com about her character's storyline this season. \"And even though she's with Guy, who's amazing, they kind of don't really know each other. They're, like, thrown into the situation, and suddenly there's a baby, and they're living in quite intense circumstances.\"",
      "Things only get more intense in Episode 6 after James tracks down his estranged wife and newborn son, Freddy, in Italy. He kidnaps the baby, forcing Jinny to go back to London where she's wanted for kidnapping Freddy after leaving James while pregnant. As the group plots to get Freddy back, James orchestrates a public confrontation with Jinny at an opera, where she appears violent and hysterical to onlookers, resulting in her being committed to an asylum.",
      "After a significant stay, she agrees to go back to James' estate in order to be reunited with Freddy, but she never gives up in her fight against James.",
      "\"I think she kind of allowed a lot of James' behavior when it was just her, because she was fighting for their marriage and all these other expectations that she had on her,\" Waterhouse says. \"But now she has a baby. I think that pushes her to realize that it's bigger than just her now, and she's got to protect her baby from him as well.\"",
      "In the end, James' siblings, Richard and Honoria (Mia Threapleton) come to Jinny's aid. They hatch a plan to distract their brother and smuggle Jinny and Freddy out of the home.",
      "While James and Richard talk downstairs, Honoria finds Freddy and escapes in a carriage with the infant. But once James realizes Freddy is gone, a fight ensues. Richard briefly knocks out James and runs upstairs to free Jinny from a locked room. But as they try to escape, they encounter James holding a gun.",
      "Richard, again, distracts James so Jinny can run away. After she flees, James points the gun at his head while Richard tries to talk him down, telling his younger brother they can fix things together.",
      "The scene then cuts to Jinny hiding behind a tree on the property as a gunshot goes off. As she rushes back to the home, she finds James catatonic over Richard's lifeless body.",
      "Why Does Lord Seadown Kill His Brother, Richard?",
      "In the lead up to Richard's shocking death, his family's dynamic is explored more in depth after his mother, Lady Brightlingsea (Fenella Woolgar), helps James pull off framing Jinny at the opera. But once Jinny is removed from the asylum and back at his estate, Lady Brightlingsea admits that her middle child may have taken the situation with Jinny too far. Speaking to Richard, the matriarch recalls how James was always a \"funny fish,\" struggling to socialize with other children but desperate to please his older brother. She suggests that James wanted to marry an American woman, Jinny, because Richard did.",
      "Richard uses this knowledge to distract James in his rescue of Jinny and Freddy.",
      "Fishwick says in an interview with TODAY.com that the murder was a \"vindictive\" act on James' part and compares his character's dynamic with Richard to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel.",
      "\"You don't necessarily see a lot of it in Season 1 or 2, but it's kind of interesting looking back and thinking that there's probably some kind of status dynamic going on between Richard, who's the charming, easygoing, firstborn son, and James, who doesn't inherit a title. I think he finds people a lot more difficult. There's this kind of brotherly tension,\" Fishwick explains.",
      "Dylan tells TODAY.com that while the death may come as a surprise to audiences, he understands it. \"I think it makes a lot of sense,\" he says.",
      "He says his character's death made his scenes with Boe's Conchita, whom he married at the very start of the show\u00a0\u2014 Season 1, Episode 1\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all the more special.",
      "\"We just tried to be really present with each other and have a lot of fun,\" Dylan says. \"Our relationship is in a really lovely place when that happens.\"",
      "Boe chimes in and adds, \"It makes it more heartbreaking and gut-wrenching.\"",
      "While Conchita was introduced in the series premiere as a free spirit, wild child American who clashes with her new husband's strict family, Boe says her character's grief will put her in survival mode.",
      "\"Now she\u2019s a single mother, and on top of that, she has to worry about taking care of her household because they are in financial distress,\" Boe says. \"I think the grief of losing her Dickie, it made her have to realign her priorities and ... she just had to really hunker down and be like, 'You know what? This is what I have to do to survive.'\""

    "story": [
      "25 YEARS AGO, my family created a lifelong connection with the Backstreet Boys. It might sound...unique for not just two fangirls, but also their parents, to be devoted to a boyband. But for our foursome, BSB has been the soundtrack to a shared life of love...and unexpected loss.",
      "The connection reached a full-circle moment this year when the group announced on TODAY their \u201cInto the Millennium\u201d Sphere residency in Las Vegas. It was a celebration of the 25-year anniversary of their hit album \u2014 but for my family, it was a reminder of a time that changed everything for us.",
      "It all began when I was about eight years old and my sister Leslie and I walked into Lucky\u2019s grocery store. She ran straight to the magazine section; four years older than me, she had recently discovered the Backstreet Boys and wanted to show me her favorite member, Nick Carter.",
      "Grabbing one of the bright teen magazines, my eyes went instead to dark-haired, green-eyed Kevin Richardson. From there, while my mom grocery shopped, our ritual became standing in that aisle, flipping the pages to every Backstreet Boys photo we could find.",
      "Our infatuation only grew as the years went by. We consumed every bit of information about all five \u201cboys,\u201d belted their songs on the radio and religiously watched \u201cTotal Request Live\u201d with Carson Daly on MTV. (My cheeks turned hot as I watched the rain scene in \u201cQuit Playing Games With My Heart.\u201d)",
      "Knowing how much we loved them, my mom often gave in to purchasing the BSB merch we saw at the mall and stores. When we begged to call \u201cTRL\u201d countless times, she always indulged us. And when we were in the car yelling every single lyric to every single song? She was right there singing along with us.",
      "By 1999, BSB was embarking on their \u201cInto the Millennium Tour,\u201d to accompany their sophomore album, \u201cMillennium.\u201d Desperate to see them in concert, Leslie and I begged our parents to let us go. By this time, our bedroom was covered in floor-to-ceiling posters; while my dad huffed about our decor choices, my mom never seemed to mind, often buying us more magazines to help us add to our collection.",
      "Finally, my dad gave in after endless pestering: \u201cIf you can save up the money to buy your own ticket, you can go.\u201d",
      "For months, my sister and I put aside the money we got from our birthdays and report cards, and we did chores around the house. I pocketed any spare change we found, including the coins by my dad's wallet. (To me, it was fair game!) When it was time to purchase tickets, we proudly stood in front of my dad with our savings: A grand total of around $100.",
      "Back in those days, we had to go to a JCPenney Ticketmaster concierge to purchase tickets. So we headed to the mall, plopped down our money and asked for two tickets to the Backstreet Boys show in Anaheim, California, the closest venue to our San Diego county town of Ramona.",
      "But then our dad chimed in saying he wanted four tickets. Perplexed, my sister and I looked at each other and told him we didn\u2019t have enough for two more.",
      "He looked at us. \u201cYou proved that you can save money for something you really want, and you did,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a treat, I will pay for your tickets, and your mom and I will also go.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 15, 1999, I attended my first Backstreet Boys concert (and first-ever concert) at the then-Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now the Honda Center). Our seats were high up, but I remember my dad borrowing a friend's camcorder to record the entire show. Sitting next to us, he zoomed in on the stage as my sister and I fangirled. The moment the band opened the show and flew in on futuristic surfboards, we couldn't contain our screams.",
      "My mom, dad, sister and I belted out the songs we all knew from repeatedly playing their albums. And when \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d \u2014 the group's ode to a mother's love \u2014 came on, we dedicated it to my mom.",
      "I saved my ticket from that show, which I still have to this day. My sister and I would rewatch the recording of the concert with my mom on the VCR until it stopped working. As a Mexican household, we also loved the group's songs in Spanish, like \u201cNunca Te Hare Llorar,\u201d as well as \u201cAnywhere For You,\u201d or \u201cDonde Quieras Yo Ir\u00e9.\u201d And it was known that my dad\u2019s favorite song was \u201cI\u2019ll Never Break Your Heart.\u201d But every single birthday and Mother's Day, for my mom, we'd always play \u201cThe Perfect Fan.\u201d",
      "And then, on May 14, 2015, she died unexpectedly in a car crash.",
      "The last day my sister and I saw our mom was on Mother\u2019s Day. We had played \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d for her that morning. Yet somehow, inexplicably, four days later we were grieving her.",
      "The Backstreet Boys' song \u201cShow Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,\u201d suddenly took on a new significance for me and my sister. The song is about losing someone close to you; at the time it was released, Kevin Richardson was mourning the death of his father, while Howie Dorough had a sister who had also passed. Additionally, the music video was dedicated to their late producer, Denniz Pop.",
      "Still, I never imagined I'd one day listen to the song while mourning myself.",
      "Fast forward to this summer, which marked 25 years since that first \u201cMillennium\u201d concert \u2014 and 10 years after my mom died. My sister, Dad and I decided we had to attend the anniversary show in Las Vegas; it would be a way to relive an important memory while also commemorating my mom. Plus, one thing my sister and I have learned is that time is sacred \u2014 and we won't always have our dad around to make memories with.",
      "A day before the July 11 opening night concert in Las Vegas, an ache settled in my chest as I thought about my mom not being able to experience this moment with us. I know she would have been so excited to dress up, and to sing every song while spending time with us. I can even picture her once again wearing the Backstreet Boys scarf we bought at the first concert around her ponytail like she once did, much to my delight.",
      "Ahead of their anniversary shows this summer, the Backstreet Boys asked their attendees to wear white. I didn't know if my dad would abide by the suggested dress code \u2014 but to my surprise, when we met up for the show, there he was in a white button-up and steel blue pants.",
      "The group opened the show with their hit \u201cLarger Than Life,\u201d a song my dad instantly knew. We laughed as he jammed out while recording the entire thing on his phone.",
      "As the show continued, we were all hyped up and tuned in to the graphics and visuals. But when photos appeared on the screen of the Backstreet Boys with their mothers, wives and kids, we knew what song was coming: \u201cThe Perfect Fan.\u201d",
      "As the piano played, Kevin took the mic for the first verse. But then, eyes closed, he lifted the mic to his mouth \u2014 then shook his head, unable to sing. We assumed he was overcome with grief and sadness as he remembered his own late mother Ann, who died in 2022.",
      "Tears rolled down my face. I looked over at my sister, and she was also crying. My dad's face was somber; even though my parents weren't in the best place when my mom died, I knew he must have been hurting, too. I even swore I could see him mouthing some of the lyrics.",
      "After that track, all I wanted was to embrace the three of us being together, feeling the power of this shared experience. I captured video of my dad recording \u201cEverybody\u201d and \u201cI Want It That Way\u201d as he proudly sang along to the chorus.",
      "Being the mega BSB fans that we are, my sister and I attended the show for a second time the following weekend.",
      "Once again, when \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d came on, my sister became emotional. This time, I put my arm around her. And just like Kevin now found himself able to sing the intro of the song without tearing up, I also managed to keep it together. I thought about how happy my mom would be that we still think of her \u2014 and the memories we shared at our first concert \u2014 whenever that song plays.",
      "And when we sent a selfie to my dad from the concert, he replied in Spanish, \u201cWhat are you doing there without me?\u201d",
      "Looks like we might have to make this a new family tradition."

      "The death of rock icon Ozzy Osbourne and the birth of YouTuber Trisha Paytas\u2019s baby is combining to ressucitate an old and deeply weird conspiracy theory: the Trisha Paytas Baby Curse.",
      "According to legend, a celebrity death accompanies the birth of each of Paytas\u2019s three babies. Even though it doesn\u2019t add up \u2014 in a lot of ways \u2014 the theory persists, and memes abound suggesting that the recently departed musician will be reincarnated as the child of the podcaster who gained fame through viral YouTube videos.",
      "(For the record, TODAY.com does not endorse this theory, which is clearly meant to be tongue-in-cheek.)",
      "What? How? Why?",
      "The theory is part of an internet meme known as the \u201cTrisha Paytas Baby Curse,\u201d which links her pregnancies to the deaths, or illness, of public figures. While entirely speculative, the joke popped up when Pope Francis died while she was pregnant with her third child, who she named Aquaman.",
      "(You read that right, Aquaman. Her two older children are Malibu Barbie and Elvis.)",

      "The internet\u2019s tongue-in-cheek conspiracy is part of a longer-running meme tied to the YouTuber\u2019s pregnancies.",
      "Who Is Trisha Paytas, and Why Is She Famous?",
      "Paytas is a YouTuber, podcaster, and media personality. She has been married to photographer Moses Hacmon since 2021.",
      "She had a cameo on Saturday Night Live in December 2024, and made her Broadway debut in February of 2025 \u2014 and event that started out as a joke, but then became reality.",
      "The Trisha Paytas Baby Curse, Explained",
      "The Trisha Paytas baby curse theory first took hold on Sept. 7, 2022. At the time, Paytas was pregnant with her first child and announced on X that she was 1 centimeter dilated. The update coincided with news of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s declining health and the monarch\u2019s death one day later on Sept. 8, 2022.",
      "\u201cAnd Trisha Paytas is 1 cm dilated\u2026 the prophecy is being fulfilled,\u201d one person wrote of the timing.",
      "When Malibu Barbie was born one week later, fans latched onto the coincidence and sparked theories that Paytas\u2019s newborn daughter was the reincarnation of the British queen.",
      "Not long after Paytas announced that she was expecting her second child, King Charles III publicly revealed his cancer diagnosis. Fans quickly began to suggest that the monarch\u2019s fate might be entangled with Paytas\u2019 pregnancy.",
      "Since his announcement in 2024, Charles has continued to undergo medical treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer. While the king is very much alive, and not reincarnated in the form of Paytas\u2019 child, the conspiracy theory continued to grow.",
      "The beloved pope died on April 21, 2025, and fans quickly connected his fate to Paytas\u2019 pregnancy. While addressing the conspiracy theory that her third child will be Pope Francis reincarnated during her April 22 podcast, Paytas leaned into the meme and joked about the possibility of naming her baby Pope or Francis.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, I guess we\u2019re naming it Pope. It\u2019s not a bad name,\u201d she commented. \u201cTechnically, there (are) girls named Frances too. So we could have a girl Frances; yeah, my dad is, my dad\u2019s name is Francis.\u201d",
      "When the revered heavy metal musician died at age 76, fans were quick to connect the dots.",
      "The meme may be coming to a natural end, however, as Paytas has publicly declared she does not intend to have more children.",
      "\u201cI feel so good about the decision,\u201d Paytas said on her podcast."

      "At least 16 people have been killed in armed clashes between Thailand and Cambodia, as tensions over a century-old border dispute spiral into the worst fighting between the two Southeast Asian nations in over a decade.",
      "Since fighting began Thursday, the two sides have been progressively involving heavier weapons, including artillery and rocket systems, with clashes expanding to 12 locations from six. Both blame the other side for starting the conflict, which Thailand\u2019s acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, warned Friday \u201ccould escalate into a state of war.\u201d",
      "At least 14 civilians and one member of the military have been killed on the Thai side, the Thai health ministry said Friday, and more than 130,000 Thai residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters. Cambodia reported one civilian death in the border area.",
      "Thailand has accused Cambodia of deliberately targeting civilians, while Cambodia accuses Thailand of using widely prohibited cluster munitions. On Thursday, Thailand, which has a far superior military, used a U.S.-made F-16 fighter jet to carry out an airstrike on a Cambodian military target.",
      "The U.S., a longtime treaty ally of Thailand, has called for an \u201cimmediate cessation\u201d of attacks.",
      "\u201cWe are particularly alarmed by reports of harm to innocent civilians,\u201d the State Department said Thursday.",
      "A simmering conflict",
      "The conflict has its roots in the disputed 500-mile border drawn largely by France, Cambodia\u2019s colonial ruler until 1953. Cambodia and Thailand have fought several deadly skirmishes since the border was delineated in 1907, particularly in the area surrounding the ancient 11th-century Hindu temple of Preah Vihear, which both sides claim as their own but was affirmed as Cambodian by the International Court of Justice in 1962 and again in 2013. Thailand rejects the court\u2019s jurisdiction.",
      "The temple\u2019s listing as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008 prompted another flare-up.",
      "Tensions have been building again since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed after both sides opened fire in another contested area where the two meet with Laos, called the Emerald Triangle. Then on Wednesday, five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion along the border, which kicked off the latest clash. Cambodia denies placing landmines.",
      "A series of tit-for-tat moves followed, including both countries expelling each other\u2019s diplomats.",
      "\u201cThe two sides are now at the point of almost no return,\u201d Pou Sothirak, a former Cambodian ambassador to Japan and a Distinguished Senior Adviser to the Cambodian Center for Regional Studies in Phnom Penh, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve locked into this \u2018we\u2019re the victim and you\u2019re the aggressor\u2019 narrative,\u201d he said.",
      "Political fallout",
      "The dispute has set off political turmoil in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended early this month after an extraordinary leak of her phone call with Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia for almost four decades as effectively a one-party state before handing power to his son Hun Manet two years ago.",
      "The father still maintains his grip over Cambodian affairs, which apparently prompted the call by Paetongtarn, 38, whose father, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was known to be close to the 72-year-old Hun Sen. She has said she was trying to defuse the border dispute in the call, during which she referred to Hun Sen as \u201cuncle.\u201d",
      "The conversation, recorded and released by Hun Sen himself, prompted outrage in Thailand, where there was already widespread dissatisfaction with her handling of the border dispute.",
      "Paetongtarn also blasted a Thai army commander during the call, angering an institution that has frequently intervened in the country\u2019s politics, experts said.",
      "\u201cWe have a situation today in which the Thai military is making its own foreign policy against Cambodia. The Thai civilian government has no control over the army at all,\u201d said Paul Wesley Chambers, a visiting fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s free for all and really out of control,\u201d he said of the situation this week, adding that the conflict could topple Phumtham as Thailand\u2019s acting prime minister.",
      "Cambodia said it had urged the United Nations Security Council to intervene in Thailand\u2019s \u201cunprovoked and premeditated military aggression.\u201d Thailand says it wants to resolve the conflict bilaterally, but only after Cambodia ceases its attacks.",
      "Neighboring China has offered mediation, but it is seen as closer to the government in Phnom Penh than Bangkok.",
      "Negotiating an end is going to be a challenge for both sides, Pou said, as the Thai military\u2019s effective self-governance has created a diplomatic hole between Thailand and Cambodia, which in the past has undermined the possibility of a permanent end to the border dispute.",
      "\u201cThe Thai military preemptively pressures conflicts,\u201d he said."

      "SREBRENICA, Bosnia \u2014 Nedzad Avdic stood on a gravel plateau with four men and boys with their hands tied behind their backs, preparing for death. Just 17, Avdic had been captured by Bosnian Serb forces days earlier. Now, he stood yards from an execution squad.",
      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",
      "The following day, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD party, argued in parliament that the mass killings did not constitute genocide. \u201cThe Serbs shot men there, but generally spared women and children,\u201d Alexander Wolf said in a speech.",
      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",
      "Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment. After this article was published, Sichert said in an email that he believes it's critical to investigate the causes of massacres \"because this way the death of the people at least has a little meaning.\"",
      "He went on to ask why is Srebenica recognized as a genocide but not Hiroshima. \"Because victors write history,\" Sichert said. \"Every civilian casualty should be considered equally no matter who won the war.\"",
      "Wolf, in a separate email, said that \"commemoration should not be one-sided\" and cited the killings of Serbs in the village of Kravica by Bosnian Muslim forces from Srebrenica during the war.",
      "But war crimes prosecutors and journalists found that of forty-five Serbs who died in Kravica, thirty-five were soldiers, including five who were killed after being taken prisoner. The number of Bosnian Muslims killed by Serb forces after being taken prisoner is in the thousands.",
      "Growing Denialism",
      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable.",
      "War crimes denialism generates so much traffic online that making money \u2014 not political or ideological gain \u2014 appears to motivate some of its purveyors.",
      "At one point, the directors discussed whether better influencers might help, and several of them agreed that they could.",
      "Avdic is determined to be one of them. As denialism spreads, he is more determined than ever to use what is left of his life to speak for the men and boys who died beside him on that gravel 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more aggressive day by day,\u201d he said, referring to denialism. \u201cYou have to know that we are all foreign bodies on this Earth, and we will all evaporate naturally sooner or later.\u201d",
      "A U.N.-protected \u2018safe area\u2019",
      "I first met Avdic 30 years ago covering the war in Bosnia as a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor. After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",
      "Avdic and his father were among the roughly 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men who fled Srebrenica on foot when Bosnian Serb forces attacked in July 1995. The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married. Now, Nedzad works as a manager at a company in Srebrenica that produces parts for luxury car interiors. Elvisa works at a local meteorological station. They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking about Srebrenica is difficult but cathartic. \u201cIt was my choice to go to Berlin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that I wish. It is emotional, and it is difficult for me.\u201d",
      "Local Bosnian Muslims have transformed the cavernous former car battery factory that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers used as a base into a museum documenting the genocide. Across the street, the headstones of the thousands of Muslim men and boys killed in the massacres cover a lush green field and hillside.",
      "In recent years, though, Muslims have slowly left Srebrenica, many of them citing economic and safety concerns. Once a majority-Muslim town, Srebrenica is now roughly half-Serb, half-Muslim.",
      "Elvisa, Avdic\u2019s wife, said she worries about her children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cI was 13 years old then in 1995. My daughter is now 13 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m more emotional about that time. When we are older, we care more and we feel more.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur grandmother was killed,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cut her throat.\u201d",
      "Defiance and threats",
      "Avdic said provocations still happen, including when a local priest once played Serb nationalist songs to taunt Muslim residents.",
      "\u201cHe will die with his evil,\u201d Avdic said of the priest.",
      "As denialism spreads, Serb nationalists have grown more defiant. In nearby towns, Avdic is sometimes recognized and mocked by them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged the danger. \u201cYou never know what could happen, because I\u2019m a witness.\u201d",
      "Avdic and his wife are torn. Leaving Srebrenica might be better for their children, but Avdic believes it is his duty to raise his family here and speak for the men and boys who died beside him.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/united-kingdom/landmark-ruling-trans-women-uk-top-court-sparks-heartbreak-confusion-rcna210548",
    "published": "Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "A judgment by the U.K.\u2019s Supreme Court that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex came a blow to campaigners for trans rights.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer fans know it as \u201challowed ground,\u201d so when Billie Sky Walker walked onto the field at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium two years ago, she achieved a dream held by players around the world.",
      "Before a Community Shield men\u2019s match between Manchester City and Arsenal in August 2023, she proudly donned an official shirt as a representative of the Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in England, that read, \u201cThe FA is for all.\u201d",
      "Today, the 28-year-old is barred from playing in FA-organized tournaments following a landmark judgment by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in April that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex \u2014 a huge blow to campaigners for transgender rights that could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of life in the U.K., be it admission to changing rooms or decisions on hospital beds, equal pay claims and domestic violence shelters.",
      "After the judgment, a number of sporting governing bodies, including the FA, changed their rules so that only those born biologically female are allowed to play, excluding Walker and 28 other transgender players across England from the association. The Scottish Football Association followed suit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Irish Football Association appears likely to do the same.",
      "Describing the ruling as \u201cconfusing and upsetting,\u201d Walker said she had been welcomed \u201cinto this space\u201d by her cisgender peers, or women whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Calling the decision to bar Walker \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d her former teammate Lucy Leiter, 24, said it was not the case that \u201conly trans women think they should play,\u201d adding, \u201cThe support has been unequivocal from everyone I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d",
      "Walker, who said she felt that she was a girl from the age of 5 and transitioned at the age of 24, said that playing soccer on a women\u2019s team \u201creally established a huge essence of who I am, because it gave me the safety and comfort and knowledge that I\u2019m enough.\u201d",
      "Intense debate",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came amid intense and sometimes toxic public debate in the U.K. over the intersection of transgender and women\u2019s rights. The debate has also simmered in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has made it one of his signature issues by signing an executive order in February banning trans women from women\u2019s sports at the national level.",
      "In December 2022, Scottish lawmakers approved a bill that allowed anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender identity using gender certificates, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland later brought a legal case against the semiautonomous government, arguing that sex-based protections should apply only to people who were born female.",
      "And Britain\u2019s central government blocked the law the following year, invoking for the first time a section of the 25-year-old act that gave the Scottish Parliament control over most of its own affairs.",
      "The For Women Scotland case nonetheless worked its way through the court system, reaching the Supreme Court this spring.",
      "After the court\u2019s 12 justices ruled unanimously in the group\u2019s favor, the presiding judge, Lord Hodge, said the decision should not be seen as \u201ca triumph of one side over the other,\u201d and emphasized that transgender people remain protected under the law.",
      "For Women Scotland campaigners celebrated the verdict with hugs, tears of happiness and Champagne as they left the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThere was elation and disbelief and, yes, I was absolutely thrilled,\u201d Susan Smith, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, told NBC News in a telephone interview last month. \u201cIf people were entitled to say that their sex in law had changed, you can\u2019t control who applies for that.\u201d",
      "For Smith and her group, the issue of legal gender recognition touches on who gets to make decisions about women\u2019s lives and bodies, including their access to spaces from hospital wards to rape crisis centers and prisons."

    "story": [
      "Standing around 10 feet tall, weighing around 220 pounds and with an axe-like beak capable of delivering devastating strikes, the terror bird would have proved a formidable foe for most creatures.",
      "But around 13 million years ago, one of them may have fallen prey to an even larger creature, a team of paleontologists in Colombia have discovered after examining bite marks in a fossilized bone of one of the fearsome birds.",
      "Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team hypothesized that it was killed and eaten or consumed through scavenging by a medium sized caiman, a crocodile-like reptile.",
      "\u201cThis is a fascinating story of the interaction of two very iconic animals in the past,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Link, the study\u2019s lead author, told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe actually found not only the first record of a terror bird in northern south America, but the tooth marks of a large caiman that has probably fed on it,\u201d he added.",
      "Terror bird fossils, which are rare, have mostly been identified in the southern part of the continent.",
      "While tooth marks are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in the fossil record, it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d to find evidence that indicates an apex predator being hunted or scavenged by another, said Link, an associate professor of  biological sciences at the Los Andes University in Colombia.",
      "Writing in \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team said the teeth marks showed no signs of healing, suggesting that the attack was fatal.",
      "Based on the finding, they added that terror birds might have faced higher risk of being killed and eaten than previously expected.",
      "To identify the attacker, Link and his team scanned the fossil and analyzed the size, shape and spacing of the tooth marks. After comparing those marks with teeth of crocodyliforms from the region, they concluded that the trace maker was likely a juvenile caiman about 15 feet long.",
      "It remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know if the caiman ate the terror bird after killing it or whether it scavenged the carcass, Link said. If the bird was alive, it was likely attacked while drinking at a river, researchers wrote, and conversely, if it was dead, the caiman found and fed on its body near water.",
      "\u201cThis story will not be told completely as we have no further evidence to choose between these two hypotheses.\u201d Link said.",
      "The discovery challenges the assumption of \u201ca linear relation between predators feeding on herbivores feeding in plants,\u201d he added. \u201cThe food web is really much more complex.\u201d",
      "The lower part of the bird\u2019s left leg bone used in the study was unearthed in the renowned La Venta fossil beds of Colombia two decades ago by Cesar Perdomo, a local paleontologist."

      "The Israeli military says its forces \"accidentally\" hit Gaza's only Catholic church last week, following a probe into the strike that killed three people and injured nine others, including a parish priest who was a close friend of the late Pope Francis.",
      "The deadly strike July 17 drew international condemnation, including from the Vatican, with Pope Leo XIV calling for an end to the \u201cbarbarity of war.\"",
      "President Donald Trump also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the mortar strike, with his administration calling for an investigation.",
      "\"Everyone is appalled,\" White House spokesperson Tammy Bruce said at the time.",
      "Netanyahu's office subsequently expressed regret over the strike, while the Israeli military said it would conduct an investigation.",
      "On Wednesday, it announced that the southern command had completed its inquiry the day before, determining that troops had struck the church \"due to an unintentional deviation of munitions,\" in line with its preliminary statement that the strike was accidental.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged that the impact of the strike \"caused damage to the structure\" of the church and \"injured several Gazan civilians.\" It did not acknowledge that three people were killed in the incident, according to church officials. Asked to comment on why the fatalities were not mentioned, the IDF acknowledged it was aware of the deaths.",

      "The IDF said adjustments had been made to \u201cimprove the accuracy of fire\u201d during the operation in which the church was struck \u2014 and that following the incident, \u201cguidelines for opening fire near religious buildings, shelters, and other sensitive sites were further clarified.\u201d Asked for further information on what adjustments had been made and how guidelines were further clarified, an IDF spokesperson would not elaborate beyond the initial statement.",
      "Throughout the war in Gaza, civilians have frequently been killed in strikes impacting civilian buildings and shelters, including religious sites.",

      "Francis condemned the attack at the time. Israeli officials denied responsibility.",
      "The IDF sought to emphasize Wednesday that it had facilitated the transfer of aid to Holy Family Church, in addition to coordinating the visit of a delegation on behalf of the Greek and Latin patriarchs, who were accompanied by a group of Christian clergy. Pizzaballa was among those to make the rare and dangerous trip, with Israel having sealed off the enclave to visits from foreign officials.",
      "The IDF's completion of its probe and the release of its findings were markedly swift, with the military still to release the results of a growing number of investigations since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip.",

      "Baseball is known as America\u2019s pastime, but it has long been a global game. From the Dominican Republic to Japan to Venezuela, the sport reigns supreme for fans, and countless players are on Major League Baseball rosters.",
      "The next country that could soon be on that list? India.",
      "While its residents may prefer a different game with a ball and a bat \u2014 cricket \u2014 it\u2019s also the motherland of Arjun Nimmala, the top prospect in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. Picked 20th overall in the 2023 draft, Nimmala is the first first-generation Indian American to be selected in the first round.",
      "Nimmala, who grew up outside Tampa, Florida, said his father introduced him to cricket at a young age but also taught him baseball. He fell in love with the sport and played competitively all the way through high school until the Blue Jays selected him at just 17 years old.",
      "Two years later, he is ranked No. 46 out of 900 prospects by MLB and considered a future centerpiece of the organization.",
      "While Nimmala, currently with the Blue Jays\u2019 high-A affiliate Vancouver Canadians, continues to ascend the minor leagues, MLB is doing extensive outreach in India by putting together tournaments for children and taking baseball programs to schools.",
      "\u201cWe want to try to introduce the sport to as many kids as possible,\u201d Chris Marinak, MLB\u2019s chief operations and strategy officer, told NBC News. \u201cThat\u2019s the foot in the door. That\u2019s the way that you educate kids on the game \u2014 you get kids to fall in love with it, and they become fans for the rest of their lives.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on getting our MLB games on broadcast and streaming,\u201d Marinak said. \u201cWe have two partners in India right now that are putting games live for the postseason and the regular season, and we\u2019re seeing great interest from fans around consumption.\u201d",
      "MLB opened an office in India in 2019 and since 2021 has hosted the MLB Cup, a tournament for amateur youth teams across the country.",
      "Nimmala traveled to India in 2023 to see the initiatives the league was producing and to help grow the game in the country where much of his family still lives.",
      "\u201cTo be able to go there and not only see that baseball is a part of India, as well, but just also trying to make it bigger, I think that makes me super proud,\u201d Nimmala said. \u201cKnowing that I have a possibility of doing that and just seeing how much baseball is played in India already, I thought was very cool.\u201d",
      "Asked how big baseball can be in India, a country with 1.46 billion people, Marinak said MLB has high goals.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a billion fans that are watching cricket, it creates a real opportunity to grow the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can get baseball to the scale of cricket, it would be a huge penetration into that market. It would look a lot like what you see in Japan [and the] United States. It can be done.\u201d",
      "Nimmala says the goal remains to make the major leagues, though that could take multiple years because of his age and experience. His 17 home runs last year led all players ages 18 or younger, and after some early-season struggles, he turned up his production in the second half.",
      "From June 27 on, Nimmala hit .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers over his final 53 games.",
      "Known as a solid fielder, he has elite arm strength, according to MLB.com.",
      "But the stats tell only one part of his story. By just being on the field, Nimmala is inspiring a whole new generation of Indian players.",
      "\u201cI do get a lot of messages, especially on Instagram, from younger kids that are Indian that start to play baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Dude, I really look up to you.\u2019 I think it\u2019s super cool to see that.\u201d",

      "It prompted howls of outrage and dismay, from not just Ukrainians themselves, but also Western officials and experts alarmed that the country could be backsliding on its endemic graft problem. It came a week after the arrest of a prominent anti-corruption campaigner who had embarrassed senior officials with investigations into their affairs.",
      "All of it overshadowed a third round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that began Wednesday in Istanbul.",
      "Though both sides remain pessimistic about serious progress, they are the first discussions since President Donald Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a 50-day ultimatum to agree to a truce or face new tariffs. Most observers expect another prisoner exchange but little else.",
      "Many Ukrainians are also worried that the country\u2019s opponents will weaponize Zelenskyy\u2019s move as evidence of the corruption that they say makes supporting Kyiv untenable.",

      "President Donald Trump said Tuesday on Truth Social that his administration had reached a deal with Japan, one of the largest U.S. trading partners, to lower its tariff rate to 15% as part of a sweeping trade agreement.",
      "That rate is lower than the 24% that Trump threatened Japan with on April 2 and the 25% he said he would hit Japanese imports with in a letter on July 7. Before Trump\u2019s current term, the effective U.S. tariff rate on Japanese imports was less than 2%, according to World Bank data.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the agreement, saying the 15% rate was the lowest so far among countries that sell more goods to the United States than they buy from it.",
      "\u201cWe have exerted all our efforts to protect our national interests,\u201d he told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday. \u201cAmong the countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, we have achieved the greatest results.\u201d",
      "Aug. 1 is the latest deadline Trump has imposed on countries to make deals to avoid tariff rates that Trump himself had set in dozens of letters he fired off on social media. Even though that deadline had been delayed before, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday on Fox Business Network that it was a \u201cpretty hard deadline.\u201d",
      "Since Trump\u2019s so-called Liberation Day on April 2, the administration has yet to strike any formal trade deals, instead signing a handful of framework deals that can be turned into fully fledged deals later.",
      "Japan has been furiously trying to avoid as much of a hit from Trump\u2019s global tariffs as possible. Japan\u2019s lead trade negotiator has visited the United States at least eight times, most recently Monday, when he met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for more than two hours.",
      "As part of the agreement, Trump said Japan would \u201cinvest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States, which will receive 90% of the Profits.\u201d It was unclear how such an investment would work.",
      "Japan is already the biggest foreign investor in the United States, directly investing $754.1 billion last year according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.",
      "Trump touted the announcement at an event with congressional Republicans later Tuesday, saying the tariffs \u201ckicked in better than anybody other than me and a few of the people in the room thought could happen.\u201d",
      "He added that Japan would form a joint venture with the United States related to liquefied natural gas in Alaska.",
      "Japan was the fifth-biggest source of U.S. imports last year, with American consumers and companies buying nearly $150 billion of goods from the country, according to Commerce Department data.",
      "The talks came at a tough time politically for Ishiba, whose Liberal Democratic Party recently lost both houses of parliament. Ishiba pledged to stay on as leader, in part to address economic headwinds.",
      "Trump had recently downplayed the chances of an agreement with Japan.",
      "\u201cThe Japanese are tough, but ultimately you have to understand we\u2019re just going to send a letter saying, \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to pay, otherwise you don\u2019t have to do business with us.\u2019 But there\u2019s a chance,\u201d he said June 16.",

As part of the deal, Nippon agreed to create at least 70,000 jobs through a $14 billion investment, according to both companies and the White House. The companies later upped that to 100,000 jobs but clarified that the additions included \u201cdirect, indirect, and induced jobs.\u201d"

      "A podcast popular among young men shocked the internet this week with an unexpected interview guest: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "But Netanyahu\u2019s bid to appeal to young people appeared to backfire online, where the interview drew widespread criticism from viewers across the political spectrum.",
      "His interviewers, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron \u201cSteiny\u201d Steinberg, are members of the Nelk Boys, a group of social media influencers known for their vlogs and prank videos. The group, which has amassed more than 8.5 million subscribers on YouTube, attracted even more fans after its content began to highlight more conservative political figures, including President Donald Trump, whom the podcast interviewed in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s hourlong interview, which dropped on the Nelk Boys\u2019 \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d on Monday, was met with overwhelmingly critical reception online, with viewers accusing the podcasters of asking softball questions and neglecting to push back against Netanyahu\u2019s claims.",
      "Netanyahu and his government continue to face worldwide outrage over the war in Gaza that followed the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The podcast\u2019s YouTube channel lost more than 10,000 subscribers within a day, according to the social media tracking platform Social Blade. On YouTube, top comments on the episode were critical of the hosts\u2019 apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "\u201cI see so much stuff about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Iran and Palestine, and to be honest, I just really don\u2019t know what is going on there,\u201d Forgeard said in the episode. Steinberg said he was similarly hoping to \u201cget educated\u201d by interviewing Netanyahu.",
      "At one point, the topic of discussion turned to Netanyahu\u2019s and Trump\u2019s shared affection for hamburgers. Asked about his go-to McDonald\u2019s order, Netanyahu revealed that he prefers Burger King, leading Steinberg to respond, appalled: \u201cThat\u2019s your worst take, I think.\u201d",
      "Throughout the rest of the interview, Netanyahu condemned anti-Israel protesters as \u201cun-American\u201d and contrasted life in Israel with life under the oppressive regime in Iran. He also railed against New York\u2019s Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, calling his proposals for the city \u201cnonsense.\u201d (Mamdani has called Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza \u201cgenocide\u201d and has said he would arrest Netanyahu, who is the subject of a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court, if he visited New York City.)",
      "Asked why he\u2019s \u201cso hated worldwide,\u201d Netanyahu answered: \u201cWell, a lot of propaganda. First of all, I\u2019m not hated worldwide.\u201d He said Israel has received a lot of goodwill from many in Europe, claiming that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran also \u201cliberated them, because those Iranian missiles were geared at Europe, too, and ultimately at America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe propaganda is there, I don\u2019t deny it,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBut people also have, you know, sometimes the truth beckons. And what Israel did with President Trump is safeguard free societies from a menace. I mean, this Iranian regime hangs gays from cranes.\u201d",
      "On Monday, 25 countries, including Britain, Japan and many European nations, called on Israel to end the war in Gaza \u2014 a sign of Israel\u2019s traditional allies\u2019 dismay over the conflict\u2019s humanitarian toll. Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities, with much of the enclave\u2019s population driven from their homes and pushed to the edge of starvation.",
      "The Israeli military and government officials have repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting civilian sites, including hospitals and schools, as cover for its operations, an accusation that health officials and Hamas have denied.",
      "Israel has also faced mounting accusations of war crimes and genocide, including in a case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice, the United Nations\u2019 top court. The court last year ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Both Israel and the United States have rejected accusations of genocide.",
      "Online, clips of Netanyahu\u2019s interview drew viral backlash from viewers, many of whom accused the Nelk Boys of platforming \u201cgenocide propaganda\u201d and compared interviewing Netanyahu to interviewing Adolf Hitler.",
      "Far-left political streamer Hasan Piker and far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes were among those who criticized the latest \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d episode Monday during separate livestreams on their platforms.",
      "\u201cYou just basically presented someone who is a war criminal, someone who is doing a genocide, in a somewhat neutral light,\u201d Piker told Forgeard and Steinberg in his stream. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be neutral when you have someone like Benjamin Netanyahu directly in an opportunity to talk to him. But that\u2019s what happened, so there is moral culpability here for you guys individually.\u201d",
      "He added that while he would agree to interview Netanyahu if he were given the opportunity, he would be \u201cwell-equipped\u201d to fact-check his statements and push back against potentially dubious claims.",
      "Forgeard, in response, countered that their style of interviewing could \"give us the opportunity to get the biggest people in the world.\"",
      "\"And I think you\u2019ll know by the 'Full Send Podcast' when you watch it, it\u2019s like, 'Hey, these guys are going to get big guests. We might not necessarily get these guys grilling these people,'\" Forgeard said. \"And that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to come to expect.\"",
      "Fuentes, in his own stream with Forgeard and Steinberg, also questioned the moral equivalency between himself, who has faced condemnation online for his views and beliefs, and \u201ca foreign head of state who is killing women and children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who\u2019s in the process of committing what is effectively an ethnic cleansing and a genocide,\u201d Fuentes said.",
      "The interview struggled to land positively even among some supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s military agenda. In The Times of Israel on Tuesday, contributor Elkana Bar Eitan expressed his disappointment that Netanyahu \u201cblew it\u201d on the podcast, despite the lack of pushback he got from the hosts.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to witness how Netanyahu, once a master communicator, missed this opportunity and showed that he\u2019s lost his touch, even in English,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cDespite the friendly atmosphere and softball questions, Netanyahu came across as completely detached from reality.\u201d",
      "A representative for the \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d declined to comment.",
      "In a video responding to the backlash, Steinberg and Forgeard said they plan to \u201cgive the other side the opportunity\u201d to speak on their next episode, though it\u2019s unclear what guest they\u2019re referring to.",
      "\u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d Forgeard said. \u201cAnd if we have to take the fall and be the bad guys for having the controversial people on, I think we\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d"

If you don\u2019t treat this person, we\u2019re going to pick you up right here,\u2019\u201d said the doctor, who works at a health center in Guanajuato, in central Mexico, and who requested complete anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "In many regions of Mexico, organized crime attacks have affected hospitals, even taking over operating rooms and emergency rooms, where hitmen kidnap medical personnel to force them to treat the wounded in the frequent clashes they wage with other cartels.",
      "The doctor interviewed by Noticias Telemundo in Guanajuato claimed that, on one occasion, he was contacted in the early hours by a high-ranking local drug operative, who made an unusual request.",
      "\u201cI received a call requesting treatment for a person who had been shot by a firearm. And they arrived at the main entrances of the hospitals with long guns, demanding treatment for their patient,\u201d the doctor said. On several occasions, the doctor said, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel forced him to use his equipment to treat hitmen.",
      "Noticias Telemundo confirmed that both the local boss and the hitman whose life was saved later died in a confrontation with the Mexican army. For the safety of the doctor interviewed in Guanajuato, their names are being withheld.",
      "According to the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, cartels and criminal groups continue to contribute to the high levels of violence in Mexico.",
      "\u201cOrganized crime continues to be a key player in the lives of Mexicans. This is evident because some criminal groups have managed to force the Mexican state to lose control of certain territories, and because of the corruption and impunity that allow them to continue to reign and expand their capabilities,\u201d Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, co-director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.",
      "So far, official data shows that from September 2024 to April 2025, there was a 32.9% decrease in the daily average of intentional homicide victims, falling from 86.9 victims per day to 58.3.",
      "However, disappearances increased significantly: In the first 100 days of Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration, 4,010 disappearances were recorded, an average of 40 per day, compared with the figure of 25 recorded during the previous six-year term.",
      "\u201cThere are many missing people who, in reality, have already been kidnapped by drug traffickers and buried in so-called narco-graves,\u201d said David Saucedo, a security analyst based in Mexico City. \u201cThe cartels are hiding the bodies, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a reduction in homicides in several states across the country. But it\u2019s not that there are fewer deaths; there are fewer bodies. They\u2019re hiding the bodies,\u201d Saucedo asserted.",
      "'This shouldn't be normal'",
      "According to the latest report from the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the most (980 from January to April 2025). In February 2025, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Safety revealed that 87.5% of the population considered public safety to be the state\u2019s most serious problem.",
      "\u201cIn Guanajuato, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel is fighting over drug trafficking with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and that\u2019s generating a lot of violence,\u201d Correa-Cabrera explained. \u201cThese organized crime groups are fighting for control of spaces because they need more street space, there are more feuds, and that\u2019s leading to more injuries and deaths, so they\u2019re taking control of medical centers.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo visited Guanajuato to document the case of a health center in the city of Celaya, where wounded drug traffickers were treated. According to a state intelligence report, until three years ago, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel used the San Ferm\u00edn Clinic to treat its wounded hitmen. However, in November 2022, gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel killed two men there and set fire to the now-abandoned facility.",
      "\u201cThe hospital where I work in Guanajuato isn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s suffered this, nor am I the only doctor who\u2019s experienced this. We see in the news that these people are arriving at certain public hospitals,\u201d the Guanajuato doctor said, adding that \u201cI can say that more colleagues have experienced this. One lives with anxiety, and this shouldn\u2019t be normal for us.\u201d",
      "Due to the strong presence of criminal groups, the Guanajuato state police have implemented operations in clinics and hospitals in several municipalities of the state, to prevent drug cartels from continuing to infiltrate those places.",
      "\u201cWhen people injured with a firearm arrive, the prosecutor\u2019s office sends us a custody request. When these people arrive, we coordinate to provide security at the hospitals,\u201d said Bernardo Cajero, director of the Celaya police and in charge of these security operations.",
      "However, the Guanajuato doctor explained that although the Silver Code has been established in Mexico \u2014 a protocol that requires authorities to be notified when there are episodes of violence or when a person with a gunshot wound arrives at a health center \u2014\u00a0this is not always followed.",
      "\u201cThey come and take our cellphones, cut us off from communication, and start threatening us, saying that if they see anything strange, they could hurt us themselves,\u201d the doctor said, with fear in his voice. \u201cOne of the things they\u2019re asking is that we not activate Code Silver and that we not notify the authorities.\u201d",
      "'It affects us all'",
      "Although there are no official figures on armed takeovers of health centers, the Guanajuato case is not unique in Mexico. In April 2024, a 10-person armed group entered a private medical center in Cuernavaca and shot and killed a patient in intensive care. In September, gunmen threatened staff at the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mazatl\u00e1n with the phrase \u201cIf they die, you die,\u201d forcing them to care for their wounded. Two months later, two attacks were reported at the Culiac\u00e1n General Hospital.",
      "\u201cWhat the drug cartels do is take over hospitals, kidnap nurses, doctors, specialists, blood banks, operating rooms, and whatever else they need. They are hospital centers where the wounded are seen and treated, so they can return to their criminal activities,\u201d Saucedo said.",
      "In 2022, a report by Insecurity Insight for the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition \u2014 a group of nongovernmental organizations focused on protecting health care \u2014 warned that Mexico had documented the most violent incidents against health care workers in Latin America: at that time, 14 recorded incidents, including three deaths, five kidnappings, two destroyed or damaged medical facilities and a damaged or looted  medical unit.",
      "\u201cBefore, they would leave their wounded in clinics, but then they would be finished off by rival groups,\u201d Saucedo said, \u201cnow, for added security, many drug trafficking groups are setting up private hospitals for themselves.\u201d",
      "Saucedo and other experts cited as examples of this trend the complaints about the hospital built by the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as   \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d and the mobile clinic set up by the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada.",
      "Researchers like Correa-Cabrera warn that these incidents also occur in other countries experiencing major security crises, such as Haiti, Ecuador and the Argentine city of Rosario, or in contexts of conventional warfare, such as the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, Somalia and Libya, among others.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new; this is part of any armed conflict, low-intensity conflict, or war,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said, \u201cbecause health care for members of these warring groups is very important.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Guanajuato doctor says the tension generated by these incidents, in which armed groups enter hospitals, is sometimes so great that medical staff request vacation time and psychological support.",
      "\u201cThe first thing is to save that person\u2019s life, regardless of the situation or the accusations, because they are human beings,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cbut it affects us all; it can cause trauma. In fact, there were colleagues who asked for their leave, and anyone would do that. It\u2019s normal when you live with that every day.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, managing director and senior fellow of Strategic Democracy Initiatives at the fund. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres has made no secret of her new British life, posting social media clips of sheep charmingly trotting into her luxury rural home while she mows the lawn of the sprawling estate, her trademark hair now natural and undyed.",
      "On Sunday she confirmed for the first time that she moved to the United Kingdom permanently for one reason: the election of President Donald Trump in November.",
      "\u201cWe got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, \u2018He got in.\u2019 And we\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re staying here,\u201d she told an audience at the Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham, central England.",
      "After her long-running talk show ended amid allegations of workplace bullying, DeGeneres, 67, bought a home in England\u2019s picturesque Cotswolds region with her wife, \u201cArrested Development\u201d star Portia de Rossi, 52.",
      "With its honey-colored stone, lush greenery and chocolate-box villages, tis 800 square-mile haven is home to a slew of celebrities, including David and Victoria Beckham, music mogul Simon Cowell and supermodel Kate Moss.",
      "It was initially meant to be a transatlantic bolt-hole, she said. But asked Sunday whether Trump\u2019s election cemented the move as permanent, she answered an unequivocal, \u201cYes,\u201d in comments the theater confirmed as accurate Monday.",
      "\u201cEverything here is just better,\u201d DeGeneres said, lamenting the state of her homeland.",
      "\u201cI wish we were at a place where it was not scary for people to be who they are. I wish that we lived in a society where everybody could accept other people and their differences,\u201d she said. \u201cSo until we\u2019re there, I think there\u2019s a hard place to say we have huge progress.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for a response to the criticisms.",
      "DeGeneres also referred to moves by the Southern Baptist Convention to endorse banning same-sex marriage and overturning a Supreme Court ruling legalizing it nationwide.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to literally stop it from happening in the future and possibly reverse it,\u201d she said. \u201cPortia and I are already looking into it, and if they do that, we\u2019re going to get married here.\u201d",
      "She also addressed the demise of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" after 19 seasons, almost two decades and more than 60 Emmys after staff members complained of a toxic workplace environment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a direct person, and I\u2019m very blunt, and I guess sometimes that means that,\" she said with a pause, \"I\u2019m mean?\u201d",
      "The theater's CEO, Mark Goucher, said in an email that it \"was a huge privilege to meet her and have her at The Everyman. Our door will always be open to our new neighbor.\u201d",
      "DeGeneres is not the first person to have toyed with leaving America's increasingly polarized social and political landscape.",
      "Starting in June last year, around the time of President Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous TV debate against Trump, Google data showed a spike in the number of Americans searching \u201chow to move to X country,\u201d according to an analysis by CNBC.",
      "In early February, days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, a poll of 2,000 people by Talker Research found that 17% wanted to leave in the next five years, with the top destination of choice being Canada; 69% of those respondents said they didn\u2019t like the direction the country was headed in, and 65% said it had become too toxic.",
      "Trump has previously given short shrift to potential wantaways. \u201cIf you\u2019re not happy, you can leave,\u201d he said in 2019.",
      "While DeGeneres appears to be enjoying an idyllic rural life, there is some evidence the grass may not be greener on the other side of the pond.",
      "Though the U.K. is often vaunted for its universal free health care, public transportation network and lack of mass shootings, it actually performs worse than the United States on a raft of quality-of-life indices measured by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which tracks such data.",
      "Out of 40 countries in the OECD, the United States ranks 10th in the \u201cBetter Life Index,\u201d which rates nations on everything from housing and income to life satisfaction, community and work-life balance. The U.K. is 14th."
