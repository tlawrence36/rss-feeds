      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers for music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs urged a New York federal judge Monday to sentence him early next month to no more than 14 months in prison for his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, meaning he'd go free almost immediately if the judge agreed.",
      "The lawyers made their arguments in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who has already rejected a proposed $50 million bail package, signaling that he doesn't believe the Grammy-winning artist is close to being released.",
      "\u201cMr. Combs\u2019s celebrity status in the realms of music, fashion, spirits, media, and finance has been shattered and Mr. Combs\u2019s legacy has been destroyed,\u201d the lawyers wrote, saying their client has been punished enough.",
      "The submission provided new information about what life behind bars for nearly 13 months has been like for Combs, what's happened to his businesses and other interests and explains why he turned down a plea-deal offer from prosecutors prior to his trial.",

      "The Bad Boy Records founder was exonerated on more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that would have required a minimum of 15 years in prison and the possibility of a life sentence.",
      "In their submission, Combs' lawyers argued that a jury sent a loud message to the judge by exonerating him of the most serious charges.",
      "\u201cPut simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an \u2018affirmative indication of innocence,\u2019\u201d the lawyers said.",
      "\u201cHe has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America \u2014 yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life,\u201d they added.",
      "Prosecutors, who will submit their recommendations prior to the Oct. 3 sentencing, have already said they\u2019ll urge Combs stay imprisoned substantially longer than the four to five years they originally thought.",
      "Defense lawyers, though, wrote in their submission Monday that prosecutors \u201chave lost all perspective.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Combs\u2019s career and reputation have been destroyed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHis life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled.\u201d",
      "Among other things, they noted that he had to let go over 100 employees from his businesses and many of them have been unable to get new jobs because of their past association with Combs.",
      "His seven children, they said, have faced \u201cdevastating consequences,\u201d including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.",
      "The lawyers also noted that Combs and his family were set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public.",
      "Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.",

      "Miles Mykkanen has come a long way since his musical theater dreams shifted to opera at Juilliard",
      "NEW YORK -- Miles Mykkanen grew up wanting to sing and dance on Broadway, but he was turned down by the musical theater programs he applied to for college. So he had to \u201csettle\u201d for studying opera at the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center.",
      "\u201cAt 18, when your sights are set on 42nd Street and then you\u2019re getting called to 65th Street, it was weirdly a letdown,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut after a few hours I kind of slapped myself and said \u2018Miles, pull yourself together.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was 16 years ago, and he has since pulled himself together to such an extent that at age 34 he\u2019s just opened the Metropolitan Opera season in a leading role in a new opera, \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.\u201d",
      "With a libretto by Gene Scheer and score by Mason Bates, the opera is based on the novel by Michael Chabon. Mykkanen portrays Sammy Clay, a Jewish kid growing up in World War II-era Brooklyn who teams with his cousin, Czech refugee Joe Kavalier, to create a comic strip hero modeled on Superman.",
      "He\u2019ll also be back at the Met in the spring in another modern opera, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho\u2019s \u201cInnocence.\u201d He plays the Bridegroom, a part he first sang in 2024 when San Francisco Opera gave the work\u2019s U.S. premiere.",
      "Mykkanen had sung at the Met before, mostly attracting little attention in small parts, though his haunting rendition of the Holy Fool in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d in 2021 drew critical acclaim.",
      "\u201cBut this season is so ideal,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cAll of a sudden my schedule came together, and I thought, my God, where did this all come from.\u201d",
      "When the Met was casting \u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d it was Michael Heaston, the artistic administrator, who thought of Mykkanen for the role of Sammy.",
      "\u201cI first became acquainted with Miles when he was still a student at Juilliard, and he immediately impressed me,\u201d Heaston said. \u201cHe is a singer who can straddle genres, that rare artist who can sing a heartfelt operatic aria in one moment and then turn on a dime to a classic tune from the American Songbook.",
      "\u201cWhen I looked at Mason\u2019s score and considered the vocal and acting demands alike, it seemed tailor-made for Miles.\u201d",
      "Mary Birnbaum, who taught Mykkanen acting at Juilliard, said she\u2019s not surprised at his sudden rise to prominence.",
      "\u201cHonestly it\u2019s what I thought he would do all along,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very American sound, and it\u2019s appealing and it\u2019s lush. But also he\u2019s bold as an actor \u2026 and he makes material look better for being in it.\u201d",
      "By coincidence, both his roles this season are people who have something to hide. \u201cThey are characters with two huge secrets that are kind of gnawing away at them,\u201d Mykkanen said.",

      "\u201cAs a gay man myself, it\u2019s been really rewarding for me to be working on this role, thinking back to my coming out process 20 years ago now,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSammy wants to believe there\u2019s a future for him, but he keeps struggling and wondering if the world will ever get past its prejudice and accept him.\u201d",
      "\u201cInnocence\u201d deals with the lingering effects of a school shooting 10 years later, and as secrets are peeled away, the Bridegroom\u2019s role in the horrific events is gradually exposed.",
      "Mykkanen relishes the very different musical challenges the two roles provide. Saariaho\u2019s score for \u201cInnocence,\u201d he said is composed with a kind of \u201cmathematical\u201d precision. \u201cWhen I first cracked it open, it was overwhelming because of the time signatures, the key signatures. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what was she thinking, how do you put this all together?\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d written in a style that uses what Bates calls \u201csymphonic electronica,\u201d has been easier to learn. \u201cI almost feel it\u2019s starting to carve a new genre in opera,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSomething American opera has been trying to find in the last decade or so. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay to say it\u2019s musical theater, but at times it\u2019s very colloquial.\u201d",
      "Mykkanen grew up in the remote Ironwood region of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, where both his parents were high school band directors. Though he displayed a talent for singing at a young age, it was show music rather than opera that inspired him. When his parents found him a classical voice teacher, \u201cFor me it was a means to an end, to develop my voice so I could sing on the Broadway stage.\u201d",
      "Though his career now takes him all over the U.S. and to Europe, Mykkanen still calls the Ironwood region home. In 2020, he launched an arts festival called Emberlight that has grown into a two-month summer program of live performance, film, art shows and talkbacks with visiting artists. When he\u2019s not on site he handles logistics remotely and also relies heavily on volunteers.",
      "\u201cJust being the person who with a lot of other people behind me brings art to this region which is rural and remote \u2026 It\u2019s been one of the big blessings of my life,\u201d he said.",
      "And when he isn\u2019t performing, he returns. \u201cI have a room in my parents\u2019 basement where I store my stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m between contracts I come back here and stay with my mom and dad. \u2026 I\u2019lll call them from Amsterdam and say \u2018OK, what are we having for dinner next Tuesday when I land.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay\u201d runs through Oct. 11. Also starring are baritone Andrzej Filo\u0144czyk as Joe; soprano Lauren Snouffer as his sister, Sarah; soprano Sun-Ly Pierce as Rosa Saks, and baritone Edward Nelson as Tracy Bacon. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts the production directed by Bartlett Sher.",

      "Pamela Anderson has embraced a makeup-free lifestyle at 58, attending fashion shows and film premieres with a bare face",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Pamela Anderson has nothing against makeup. It's just that she's been there, done that in her younger years. That's why now, at 58, she's attending fashion shows and film premieres with a blissfully bare face.",
      "It's a look, especially for older women, that serves to plague and perplex. Do we chase youth (and relevancy) with a full face, or do we foster radiant skin and march on makeup free?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the prettiest girl in the room,\u201d Anderson told Vogue ahead of a recent show she attended during Paris Fashion Week. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just freedom. It\u2019s like a relief.\u201d",
      "Down here in the non-celebrity world, is it just as easy and comfortable to go makeup free? Some proponents of the look, along with style and beauty experts, weigh in.",
      "Women, particularly older women, are not universally giving up makeup, but Anderson, Alicia Keys and other celebrities who have publicly shown off bare faces have certainly inspired some to cast it off.",
      "Working women, however, acknowledge difficulties doing that on the job \u2014 especially in traditional, less creative work spaces.",
      "\u201cI do still think that there are some politics associated with it. More around feeling and looking polished,\u201d said Deborah Borg, the chief of human resources for a creative-leaning company that has roughly 25,000 employees.",
      "She said she's seen more women come into work makeup-free since COVID, and thinks the pandemic significantly altered the workplace dynamic.",
      "Borg, 49, gave up makeup four years ago, save an occasional swipe of her bold, signature red lipstick. At Dalya, a cozy clothing shop in New York's trendy Soho neighborhood, she lent herself as a model to demonstrate how to help one's bare skin glow and how to use attire and accessories to accentuate the look.",
      "Makeup artist Rebecca Robles counseled Borg and others with mature skin to think hydration when choosing products to make the most of their bare faces.",
      "Robles recommends a five-step workday routine: A gentle cleanser that doesn't strip the skin; a vitamin C serum to brighten and mitigate fine lines; a moisturizer with sun protection; a separate broad-spectrum sunscreen for an extra boost (don't forget to apply that to the ears); and a glossy lip balm for a bit of added polish.",
      "No mascara? No problem. Use a lash curler to offer a bit of pop to the eye, Robles said. And gently brush brows into place to complete the look.",
      "Find products with hyaluronic acid and ceramides, Robles suggests, and always swipe up with skincare products. Minimize tugging and pulling on the skin.",
      "\u201cWhen your skin is glowing, one thing that\u2019s really fun to keep in mind is that light reflects off that moisture in the skin and can help blur out any fine lines or enlarged pores. So it\u2019s win-win,\u201d Robles said.",
      "She advised that each product should sit for a minute or two before the next step is applied.",
      "Borg emphasized the ease of her morning routine since going makeup free. She used to spend about 30 minutes just on makeup. Now, she does hair and face in half that time.",

      "Finally, accessorize. Tincher said added touches like lapel pins, earrings and necklaces can provide a finished polish \u2014 especially if that polish is still expected at work. A considered style can offset judgments about going makeup free, she said.",
      "\u201cThink of your outfit as the big picture. When you walk in, what is the statement that it\u2019s making? It\u2019s not just about one part of you, it\u2019s your whole presence in a room,\u201d she said.",

      "Christopher Nolan has been elected to lead the Directors Guild of America, the organization said late Saturday. The Oscar-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d filmmaker said in a statement that it is, \u201cone of the greatest honors of my career.\u201d",
      "The guild represents the interests of some 19,500 film and television directors in the United States and abroad, in addition to hosting the DGA awards annually.",
      "\u201cOur industry is experiencing tremendous change, and I thank the Guild\u2019s membership for entrusting me with this responsibility,\u201d said Nolan, a well-known champion of the theatrical experience and film stock.",
      "The box office success of \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which was shot entirely on large-format film ( a combination of 70mm and IMAX ), and made over $976 million worldwide made many in the industry reconsider the mass audience appeal of a format that not too long ago was in danger of extinction. Just over a decade ago, facing bankruptcy and an industry that seemed to be migrating to digital, Kodak nearly stopped film production. Filmmakers like Nolan, Martin Scorsese and others rallied to keep it going. Earlier this year, Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d helped prove the point again.",
      "Nolan will take over for outgoing president Lesli Linka Glatter, who led the group for four years through the Hollywood strikes of 2023. He said he looks forward to collaborating with Glatter and the board \u201cto achieve important creative and economic protections for our members.\u201d",
      "The DGA\u2019s current three-year basic agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios and streamers about rates and benefits, expires next year. The AMPTP congratulated Nolan in a statement and wrote that they \u201clook forward to partnering with President Nolan to address the issues most important to DGA members while ensuring our member companies remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry.\u201d",

      "The North American box office has slowed down after a strong September.",
      "Neither a Jordan Peele-produced horror nor a Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell romantic drama were enough to continue the September hot streak at the movies. After back-to-back weekends that had films majorly overperforming, first \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights\u201d followed by the anime \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Infinity Castle,\u201d the North American box office slowed significantly.",
      "Overall ticket sales were down nearly 50% from last weekend, with the holdover champion \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d edging out the newcomer \u201cHim\u201d for first place, according to studio estimates Sunday. Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d added $17.3 million over the weekend, bringing its total to $104.7 million, which makes it the highest grossing anime film ever in North America.",
      "The football horror \u201cHim\u201d opened in second place with an estimated $13.5 million in ticket sales. Universal Pictures opened \u201cHim\u201d in 3,168 North American theaters, where the audience was 52% male and 65% over the age of 25. Internationally, it earned $400,000.",
      "Produced by Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw and directed by Justin Tipping, \u201cHim\u201d is about a promising young quarterback (Tyriq Withers) who is invited to train with a veteran (Marlon Wayans) at an isolated compound.",
      "\u201cHim\u201d scored with neither critics (it carries a 29% on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audiences, who gave the film a C- CinemaScore. In his review for The Associated Press, film writer Jake Coyle wrote that the film \u201cwas made with the potent premise of bringing the kind of dark, satirical perspective that characterizes a Monkeypaw production to our violent national pastime. But that promise gets fumbled in an allegorical chamber play that grows increasingly tedious.\u201d",
      "\u201cHim\u201d was also nearly upstaged by another horror, \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights,\u201d which made an estimated $13 million in its third weekend. With a global total of $400 million, it\u2019s now the biggest film in the Conjuring universe.",
      "They are two of three horror movies in this weekend's top 10, including \u201cWeapons.\u201d According to data firm Comscore, this year that genre alone has generated $1.1 billion in domestic box office receipts, just several million short of the 2017 record driven by \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cGet Out.\u201d",
      "\u201cHorror movies have been on a bit of a hot streak,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's head of marketplace trends. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a record-breaking year.\u201d",
      "In addition to \u201cDemon Slayer,\u201d Sony had a new film this weekend as well: The original romance \u201cA Big Bold Beautiful Journey,\u201d starring Robbie and Farrell, but that fizzled with audiences, earning only $3.5 million from 3,300 locations. It also received largely negative reviews and currently has a 37% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cAudiences are selective in what they want to see,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cNegative reviews can create really strong headwinds for original films with no brand recognition.\u201d",
      "In its second weekend, \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d added another $6.3 million, bringing its running total to $31.6 million. The Stephen King adaptation \u201cThe Long Walk\u201d is also estimating $6.3 million in weekend two, down only 46% from its opening. Its domestic total of $22.7 million has already exceeded its production budget of $20 million (though that sum does not account for marketing and promotion).",
      "Ron Howard\u2019s 1995 hit \u201cApollo 13\u201d played in 200 theaters this weekend for its 30th anniversary as well. It made an estimated $600,000. The 30th anniversary re-release of \u201cToy Story,\u201d now in its second weekend, added $1.4 million.",
      "Next weekend there is excitement surrounding the new Paul Thomas Anderson film \u201cOne Battle After Another,\" although his biggest hit to date remains the 2007 film \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which made just over $76 million worldwide, not accounting for inflation.",

      "Anthony Roth Costanzo, who introduced $11 tickets to Opera Philadelphia, aims to surprise audiences again with the company\u2019s new season as it celebrates its 50th anniversary",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Anthony Roth Costanzo, the man who brought $11 opera tickets to Philadelphia, hopes to keep surprising audiences during the company\u2019s new season.",
      "\u201cIt is very much opera. It\u2019s dramatic, it\u2019s cathartic, it\u2019s collaborative in interdisciplinary ways,\u201d Costanzo said of Opera Philadelphia\u2019s 50th anniversary season \u2014 the first he\u2019s been able to plan since taking charge of the financially teetering company last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from what your perception of opera might be.\u201d",
      "He slated a work by Rossini to kick things off, with opening night set for Friday. But instead of choosing a repertory staple, Costanzo picked the less-familiar \u201cIl viaggio a Reims.\u201d And the production will be anything but traditional: Director Damiano Michieletto has changed the original setting from an inn to an art gallery where the portraits come alive and sing.",
      "After that the offerings become even more adventurous. There\u2019s a multimedia piece by playwright Sarah Ruhl set to music by Vivaldi \u2014 including \u201cThe Seasons\u201d \u2014 and starring Costanzo, who maintains a flourishing performing career as a countertenor. Then comes a world premiere with libretto by Pulitzer-winner Michael R. Jackson and a score by 10 different composers. Another new opera follows, by Gregory Spears, in which the chorus has the starring role. Finally, bass-baritone Dav\u00f3ne Tines performs a \u201cvaudevillian rendering\u201d of a poem by Langston Hughes.",
      "\u201cAs I put all of the pieces together, I thought, how can I encapsulate this in just a few simple words,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cAnd what occurred to me was: \u2018Opera, but different.\u2019 And that is the slogan of the season.\u201d",
      "His pride in the lineup is understandable, especially given that when he took over it wasn\u2019t certain there would even be a 2025-26 season.",
      "The company was nearing bankruptcy and needed to quickly raise $4 million, he recalled.",
      "Almost immediately he instituted a \u201cpick your price\u201d policy under which people could buy tickets to any seat in the house starting at $11.

      "Biden's team appeared to be in denial. Afterward, they gave Harris talking points that said \u201cJOE BIDEN WON.\"",
      "Harris wrote warmly of her partnership with Biden, but there were frosty moments too. As Biden faced calls to drop out of the race, he invited Harris to join him for a Fourth of July celebration at the White House.",
      "First lady Jill Biden pulled Harris' husband Doug Emhoff aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you supporting us?\u201d",

Arenas were treated to megahits like Khan\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman\u201d and \u201cSweet Thing,\u201d Knight\u2019s \u201cMidnight Train to Georgia\u201d and \u201cNeither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye),\u201d Mills\u2019 \u201cHome\u201d and \u201cNever Knew Love Like This Before,\u201d as well as LaBelle\u2019s \u201cThe Right Kinda Lover\u201d and \u201cYou Are My Friend.\u201d",
      "A rotating stage transitions each 45-minute set into the next performance, introducing each artist to their wide cross-section of concertgoers, which often includes multiple generations: parents, grandparents and even great-grandparents. Individually, the impact of Khan, Knight, LaBelle and Mills within the music industry and pop culture can\u2019t be quantified, with fans and critics praising them for never abandoning soul music or their Black audience.",
      "\u201cI hear it all the time. You know, \u2018I was weaned on you,\u2019 from mother to grandmother on down. It\u2019s lovely to hear,\u201d Khan, 72, told The Associated Press in a joint interview with LaBelle and Mills. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can\u2019t grasp the feeling that they\u2019re feeling, but I get it \u2014 I think. And I think it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d",
      "At 17 years old, Mills originated the role of Dorothy in \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d which debuted on Broadway 50 years ago. Now, 68, the Grammy winner affectionally known as \u201cthe baby\u201d by her co-headliners, says there\u2019s no need to slow down.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in the blood. What would we do? Sit at home and not do anything?\u201d said Mills, who hopes for another Broadway stint in the near future. \u201cI was 11 my first Broadway show. So, I\u2019ve been in the business my entire life.\u201d",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican legislators are poised this week to approve criminal justice measures designed to toughen bail rules, restrict magistrates' powers and evaluate offenders' mental health after the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train. The bill also could help get the death penalty carried out again in the ninth-largest U.S. state.",
      "Senate and House Republicans unveiled legislation that their leaders previously signaled would surface when the General Assembly reconvened on Monday after nearly two months away from Raleigh.",
      "The Aug. 22 death of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska \u2014 her attack caught on camera \u2014 and subsequent charges against a suspect who had previously been arrested more than a dozen times caused public outrage. An array of Republicans, President Donald Trump among them, have attempted to blame Zarutska's death on Charlotte-area leaders and Democratic state officials for what they call soft-on-crime policies.",
      "The Senate approved the legislation 28-8 late Monday, with many Democrats absent from the otherwise party-line vote. The bill now goes to the House, where a vote is likely Tuesday.",
      "Any final measure would then go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein\u2019s desk. Stein, the former attorney general, has suggested pretrial release changes and greater emphasis on mental health are needed in light of Zarutska's death.",
      "But the measure took a different direction \u2014 away from bipartisan support \u2014 when Senate Republicans approved an amendment that could in the future open the door to other forms of capital punishment beyond lethal injection, which is currently the state\u2019s sole method. North Carolina last carried out an execution in 2006.",
      "The stabbing suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., could received a death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in state court or a federal count filed against him.",
      "Brown, whose criminal record included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon, had been charged in January in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, with misusing the 911 system, a misdemeanor, according to court records.",
      "But a magistrate \u2014 a nonelected local court official who often determines if a defendant can be released while awaiting trial \u2014 released him on a written promise to return for court. And it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation for him. Brown\u2019s mother told Charlotte-area television that she had sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home.",
      "GOP Sen. Ralph Hise said the legislation has nothing to do with winning political points, but rather is a response to the failure of the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cWe need a criminal justice system that protects society from individuals. I believe these are many great steps in this bill,\u201d Hise said.",
      "The measure, named \u201cIryna\u2019s Law,\u201d would prohibit cashless bail for certain crimes and eliminate some of the discretion that magistrates and judges have for pretrial release decisions.",
      "For example, first-time defendants accused of a violent offense could only be released on a secured cash bond or receive house arrest with electronic monitoring. Such house arrest and monitoring would be the only option for some repeat defendants.",
      "The bill also attempts to ensure that more suspects are subject to psychological examinations before their potential release. Defendants accused of a violent crime and committed involuntarily in recent years to a mental health facility would be subject to a psychological evaluation.",

      "The secretary \u2014 a member of the governor's Cabinet \u2014 would have to select another method that's been adopted by another state and has not been found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. That could include the use of a firing squad, a method that's been used to execute South Carolina inmates twice this year.",

    "story": [
      "A government watchdog has raised concerns about high administrative costs in Georgia's Medicaid program",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal watchdog reported Thursday that Georgia\u2019s program requiring able-bodied adults to document low-paying work to get Medicaid has spent much more on administrative costs than on providing health care.",
      "The U.S. Government Accountability Office report on Georgia Pathways comes after Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the U.S. as part of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d signed into law by President Donald Trump.",
      "Starting in 2027, most adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month. And they must be extremely poor, earning incomes no higher than the federal poverty line.",
      "The report attributes most of the administrative costs to the implementation of changes in determining eligibility and enrolling people, along with duplicative technology, training and coordination while the state litigated to overcome Biden administration objections.",
      "\u201cNow the entire country can see what we in Georgia already know \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Medicaid work reporting requirement program is the real waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of the Georgia Democrats who requested the report. \u201cThis report shows that Pathways is incredibly effective at barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,\" his statement said.",
      "A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp countered that Democrats are responsible for the extra spending.",
      "\u201cNow, as other states prepare to adopt our model and reject one-size-fits-none big government healthcare, Democrats like Senators Ossoff and Warnock are trying to rewrite history after four years of inaction and blame the State for costs associated with their own stonewalling.\"",
      "Millions of eligible people will lose coverage due to the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to repeatedly document their work, critics say, pointing to what happened in Georgia, which is so far the only state that imposes work requirements.",
      "Georgia has among the highest rates of uninsured and is one of 10 states that refused to expand Medicaid to all adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as envisioned by President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.",
      "Instead, Kemp heralded his July 2023 launch of Georgia Pathways to Coverage, which limits Medicaid for adults to those who earn no more than poverty-level wages, now set at $15,650 a year. Georgia's traditional Medicaid still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a handful of other adults.",
      "Nationally, most adults on Medicaid in states that expanded it are already working, and in Georgia, an estimated 246,365 adults are potentially eligible for traditional Medicaid or Pathways. But a year after it launched, Pathways had enrolled around 4,300. As of this spring, there were 6,514 adults enrolled, according to the state Department of Community Health.",

      "Republicans have defended the low enrollment, saying Medicaid should be temporary for people who can get insurance through an employer.",
      "The GAO analysis shows that from fiscal year 2021 through the second quarter of 2025, Georgia reported $54.2 million in administrative spending and $26.2 million on health care. The administrative portion declined more recently, from 96.5% in fiscal year 2023 to 58.8% in fiscal year 2024. It is expected to drop more in 2025.",
      "Nearly 90% of this spending has been federal money, and Georgia used $20 million in other federal grants to help implement the program, trying to make it easier for people to apply. More spending is planned this year on improvements, publicity and staff training, the report notes.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s incredibly wasteful public spending on systems of red tape,\u201d said Joan Alker a health policy researcher at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families. \u201cAnd spending money on corporate consultants to set up complicated systems of red tape that people can\u2019t navigate, that keeps them out of health coverage, is one of the worst uses of taxpayer dollars I can think of.\u201d",
      "Kemp announced that he now wants to let low-income parents with young kids enroll without meeting work requirements, as part of an extension of Pathways that has required Trump administration approval.",

      "More than 100,000 Americans are on the transplant list and thousands die waiting because there aren\u2019t enough donations to go around. Last year there were more than 48,000 transplants, a record, the vast majority from deceased donors.",

      "A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta for two days this week to consider various vaccine recommendations",
      "NEW YORK -- A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta this week to consider whether to revise recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B, and a combination shot that protects children against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.",
      "The panel, which is charged with making vaccine recommendations, declined to recommend COVID-19 vaccines, saying instead that people could make individual decisions \u2014 a move that adds confusion as people weigh whether to get a dose this fall.",
      "During the sometimes chaotic two-day meeting, the panel also recommended new restrictions for a vaccine that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. In a surprise move, the group indefinitely postponed an expected vote on hepatitis B shots given to infants on the day they are born.",
      "With Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, leading the country's health agencies, the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, struck a different tone from past gatherings. Among the 12 members, all chosen this year by Kennedy after he fired the previous 17-member panel, are people who have criticized and spread misinformation about vaccines. Critics say the panel's makeup and agenda could sow distrust in the shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations will be sent to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that has been rocked by disagreements over Kennedy's vaccine policies. The panel's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC, and then widely followed by doctors and insurers.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the meeting.",
      "The panel on Friday debated COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus has remained a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths last fall and winter, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year\u2019s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.",
      "Panelists declined to recommend the shots for anyone, including seniors and high-risk populations. They said individuals could make their own decisions. Removing the recommendations that were previously in place may confuse Americans trying to decide whether and how to get their fall boosters.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "The divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.",
      "Several states have announced policies to try to ensure people's access to COVID-19 vaccines, worried about Friday\u2019s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continue covering the shots through 2026.",
      "The committee recommended that a combined vaccine known as MMRV should not be given to children under 4. Instead, they said in an 8-3 vote with one abstention, children in this age group should get separate vaccines \u2014 one for MMR and another for varicella, or chickenpox.",
      "Their discussions centered on rare feverish seizures that can occur in kids who receive the first dose, between the ages of 1 and 2. Medical experts agree these seizures, while potentially frightening for families, are not linked to brain function or school problems.",
      "In 2009, the ACIP changed a previous recommendation to advise that either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.",
      "Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations.",
      "About 85% of children already receive separate doses for the first round, according to information presented at the meeting.",

Government insurance programs like Medicaid, for example, would have to stop paying for the early combo dose if the acting CDC director accepts the panel's guidance.",
      "Ever since the ACIP panel in 2005 recommended a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, cases of the liver virus among infants have dropped by more than half.",
      "Nonetheless, the committee opted to revisit the guidance in this week's meeting, with members questioning whether babies born to moms who test negative for hepatitis B really need a vaccine at birth.",
      "The panelists considered whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination \u2014 something doctors and parents already can choose to do.",
      "One committee member asked if the vaccination right after birth was \u201casking our babies to solve an adult problem.\u201d Hepatitis B can spread through sex, sharing needles, or from an infected mother to a newborn baby.",
      "But several outside medical experts criticized that the committee was debating the issue at all and said the vaccine is safe and successful at reducing infant infections.",
      "After discussing it on Thursday, the panel decided Friday morning to indefinitely postpone a vote on the issue.",
      "Chairman Martin Kulldorff opened the meeting by challenging former CDC directors to a public debate. Several doctors representing outside medical groups accused the panel of not following the CDC\u2019s long-established guidelines in weighing evidence for making recommendations.",
      "CDC staff, as usual, presented numerous studies on the topics being debated, explaining how they chose which research to discuss. But a few times, panel members cited different papers they had found, including ones done in mice, which are not generally considered applicable.",
      "The committee also took a vote on Thursday that they had to redo on Friday morning concerning the government\u2019s Vaccines for Children program, which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids. On Friday, they voted to align coverage under the program with their guidance on MMRV shots. A day earlier, they had voted no on the idea.",
      "\u201cWe are rookies. \u2026 There are many technical issues that we might not grasp as of yet,\u201d Kulldorff said. He said a committee member had told him that \u201cmaybe we didn\u2019t quite understand what was going on\u201d with the vote.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Most flood control projects, road and other infrastructure projects built in a Philippine province near the capital in the last six years were substandard or overpriced to compensate for huge kickbacks given to congressmen and senators, a televised Senate inquiry was told on Tuesday.",

More than 200 people were arrested during the disturbances in which 100 law enforcers were injured.",
      "Under questioning by senators, Hernandez alleged that since 2019, infrastructure projects in Bulacan province have not been built according to approved specifications. Cheaper and longer-drying cement and low-quality construction materials were used to cover kickbacks, usually about 20% of the project cost or higher, for corrupt legislators and officials, he claimed.",

      "Manuel Bonoan, whose recent resignation as Public Works secretary was accepted by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., told the inquiry he was unaware of the irregularities.",
      "\"This is the first time that I have heard about all these shenanigans,\u201d Bonoan said when asked by senators to comment.",

      "LONDON -- A British judge on Tuesday sentenced an asylum-seeker to 12 months in prison for sexually assaulting a woman and a 14-year-old girl \u2014 charges that sparked a wave of angry protests against migrants across the United Kingdom.",
      "Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was found guilty of five offenses, including sexual assault, inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and harassment.",
      "Kebatu\u2019s arrest and prosecution prompted thousands of people to protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, northeast of London, where he was staying along with other newly-arrived migrants. Multiple protests targeting other hotels housing migrants followed in other British cities and towns, with some demonstrations attended by far-right activists.",
      "Prosecutors said Kebatu, 41, had arrived in England by boat just over a week before he approached the 14-year-old, attempted to kiss her and put his hand on the girl's thigh during incidents in Epping.",
      "The hearing heard that Kebatu said he wanted to be deported after serving his time in prison.",

      "Ukraine's armed forces face a challenging fall as Russia intensifies efforts to seize the eastern Donetsk region",
      "SLOVIANSK, Ukraine -- Fall is expected to bring another grueling test for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces as Russia intensifies its campaign to seize an eastern region, once Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland and a territory it has long sought to conquer.",
      "Russia now controls about 70% of the Donetsk region. Ukraine's forces have been pushed back to a string of four cities that analysts have dubbed its \u201cfortress belt,\u201d where they've repelled Moscow's efforts to seize the region for years.",
      "But shortages of troops, supplies and chaotic management are making it increasingly hard to resist Russia's relentless pressure in the region.",
      "As the more-than-3-year-old invasion continues despite months of U.S.-led peace efforts, analysts and the military say the country could struggle to resist an intensified push to seize the last cities in the region under Ukrainian control.",
      "Analysts and Ukrainian officers say that Russia is unlikely to engage in protracted urban battles and avoid costly fights like the storming of Bakhmut, which dragged on for months with staggering losses on both sides.",
      "\u201cAfter Bakhmut and Chasiv Yar, the Russians clearly understood that large cities turn into vast cemeteries for their army, where they lose thousands upon thousands,\u201d said Col. Pavlo Yurchuk, whose troops are defending a small city at the northern end of the fortress belt.",
      "To skirt the cities, Russian forces are pushing on the flanks and increasingly using infiltration tactics, sending small groups of soldiers through gaps between Ukrainian units.",
      "Some of these groups have achieved tactical gains, slipping behind the front line to hide in tree lines or basements, occasionally occupying abandoned positions or cutting off supply routes. But the human cost is heavy: of a five-man unit, Ukrainian commanders estimate, two are usually killed, one is wounded, one goes missing, and only one survives to call for a drone to drop water or medicine.",
      "\u201cThese are tactical successes, not strategic ones,\u201d Yurchuk said. \u201cThis tactic is very slow and does not solve the tasks of encirclement or control of large settlements.\u201d",
      "Drones and glide bombs are also playing a crucial role, allowing Russia to hit troops and supplies headed for the front and to weaken Ukraine's strongholds without head-on fighting.",
      "This summer, Russian forces stepped up attacks at the northern and southern ends of the Donetsk belt. Their strategy, Ukrainian officers say, is to sever supply lines and surround the region\u2019s cities rather than storming them directly.",
      "The region \u2014 one of four that Russia illegally annexed in 2022, though it did not control any of them \u2014 became the epicenter of the fighting since the start of the full-scale invasion.",
      "In northern Donestk, Yurchuk's 63rd Brigade is fighting to hold the town of Lyman, a key logistics hub on the way to Sloviansk.",
      "With a prewar population of 20,000, Lyman has rail connections, dozens of basements and bomb shelters, solid infrastructure and strong buildings where command posts or supply depots could be set up. It was occupied during part of the first year of the full-scale invasion but liberated in Ukraine\u2019s autumn 2022 lightning counteroffensive.",
      "If Russian forces manage to take Lyman, Yurchuk said, they could use it to build up troops and attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, a natural obstacle that helps protect Sloviansk.",
      "But the commander says he's confident Russia's latest offensive won't work.",

      "\u201cPeople are obviously one of the key problems,\u201d said Taras Chmut, director of the Come Back Alive Foundation, which has raised more than $388 million over the past decade to equip Ukraine\u2019s forces. \u201cNot only the quantity, but their dispersion on the battlefield, the inefficiency of command, and the shortcomings in training and management.\u201d",
      "On paper, he said, some brigades list thousands of soldiers but can only field hundreds in combat, a gap he attributed not to Russian superiority but to mismanagement. He said the chaos means too many soldiers are sometimes doubled up on the same tasks and targets while others are left uncovered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a systemic flaw we can neither admit nor fix,\" he said. \"Until we do, we have to make up for it with technology, with manpower, with the enemy\u2019s weaknesses on the battlefield, and with the courage of people and volunteers who step in where they can.\u201d",

      "\u201cJust because the Russians moved slowly in the past doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t accelerate,\u201d warned Nick Reynolds, a research fellow in land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute. \u201cSadly, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been under enormous pressure for a very long time.\u201d",
      "The fall of the fortress belt, he cautioned, would displace thousands of civilians and cause further economic damage. And even after capturing the whole region, the invasion is unlikely to end.",

      "Indonesia\u2019s clean energy future is at a crossroads",
      "The race to replace coal in Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest coal exporter, has become a contest between the U.S. and China. At stake is not only Indonesia\u2019s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.",
      "Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures.",
      "Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto\u2019s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia\u2019s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.",
      "These investments dwarf the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, signed in 2022 between Indonesia and a group of wealthy nations to help the country shift away from coal, which contributes 3.6% of the country\u2019s GDP.",
      "The program was faltering even before U.S. President Donald Trump's administration formally withdrew in March. Only $1.2 billion, or about 6%, of JETP finances have been disbursed while Indonesia believes it needs over $97 billion for the transition.",
      "The U.S. is the world\u2019s top oil producer and has pushed liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of talks meant to head off tariffs for Indonesia. It touts \u201cenergy dominance\u201d as a way to cut dependence on rivals like China. Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.",
      "The U.S. path risks deeper fossil fuel dependence, while China\u2019s promises jobs and cleaner power with fewer safeguards.",
      "\u201cThese two countries ... they\u2019re shaping two different visions of the future,\u201d Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.",
      "The U.S. withdrawal in March didn\u2019t derail the JETP, but impacted political leadership, analysts said.",
      "When the deal was signed, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said America had laid the groundwork. But after Trump dismantled Biden-era climate policies and pushed fossil fuel development, Indonesian officials questioned why they should transition if America isn\u2019t, Adhiguna said.",
      "Early JETP conversations \u201cset expectations unrealistically high,\u201d raising goals that were hard to achieve regardless of U.S. policy changes, he added.",
      "The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed. Foreign investment was critical given Indonesia\u2019s tiny solar and wind sector, accounting for 0.24% of total energy compared with 3.8% in the Philippines and 13% in Vietnam.",
      "Lee said the JETP also provided a unifying platform for stakeholders and helped Indonesia partner with new countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.",
      "Indonesia's JETP secretariat didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "China offers a \"different version of energy security,\" replacing imported fossil fuels with solar panels that generate electricity for decades, Adhiguna said.",
      "Major Chinese projects in Indonesia include a $6 billion supply-chain venture by battery giant CATL with local partners in 2022 and BYD\u2019s $1 billion EV plant announced in 2024 will produce 150,000 cars annually and employ 18,000 workers.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a whole-systems change,\u201d said Dinita Setyawati, an energy analyst focused on Southeast Asia at the think tank Ember. She noted this meant a country could buy solar panels from China and charge their Chinese-built electric cars with clean electricity.",
      "These projects are deployed quickly, which is crucial for Indonesia\u2019s five-year political cycles, even if Western investors offer more safeguards. POWERCHINA built a 100-megawatt solar park in just seven months in 2024.",
      "\u201cIf a U.S. company takes four years to do a feasibility study, Chinese companies will already have invested by then,\u201d Adhiguna said.",
      "But Chinese investments often have come with high environmental costs.",
      "Most of Indonesia\u2019s nickel mines, for instance, are Chinese-owned. The country has the biggest reserves of the mineral needed to build EV batteries and the mines rely on captive coal-fired power plants, built on-site to supply electricity.",
      "A 2024 study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air on the impact of nickel mining in three Indonesian provinces found pollution from smelters and the coal-fired power plants would cost the economy $2.6 billion in 2025, rising to $3.4 billion by 2030, while resulting in more than 3,800 deaths in 2025 and nearly 5,000 by 2030.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s energy minister, Bahlil Lahadalia, said in April it would boost LNG imports from the U.S. by around $10 billion as part of tariff negotiations. LNG is natural gas cooled to liquid for storage and transport, burning cleaner than coal but still emitting greenhouse gases.",
      "The risk is that the gas deals could further entrench Indonesia\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels. Committing to long-term deals risks leaving countries stuck with outdated infrastructure, even as the world moves quickly toward cheaper, faster-to-deploy solar and wind power, analysts said.",
      "Indonesia could risk falling behind in the clean energy transition and miss out on investment opportunities, such as data centers seeking renewable energy in Southeast Asia, Setyawati said.",
      "\u201cAnd once they realize it, it might be too late,\u201d she said.",

About 80% of the 1.9 gigawatts of coal capacity Indonesia built was for the captive coal plants for smelters processing minerals like nickel and cobalt for electric vehicles, according to a report by U.S.-based nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.",

      "All 125 shrine buildings will be knocked down and identical structures \u2014 as well as more than 1,500 garments and other ritual objects used in the shrine \u2014 will be rebuilt using techniques that have been painstakingly passed down over generations. There are 33 accompanying festivals and ceremonies, cumulating in a 2033 ritual that sees the presiding deity transferred to the new shrine.",
      "Ise's inner shrine is dedicated to the sun goddess Amaterasu who has been enshrined for two millennia among the mountains of Mie prefecture, on the banks of the Isuzu River.",
      "Miori Inata, in a book based on a decade photographing Ise's reconstruction, offers some theories about the constant rebuilding, including that the 20-year-cycle matches the shelf-life of stored rice or the traditional two-decade phases that make up a human lifespan \u2014 birth to adulthood, adulthood to middle age, middle age to death.",
      "Inata writes of the culminating rites marking a new shrine: \u201cI was greatly moved by the realization that what was transpiring before my eyes were precisely the same ceremonies that were performed 1,300 years ago, every 20 years since, and will continue to unfold again and again in the future.\"",
      "The rebuilding was stopped only twice, during the civil wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, and after World War II, according to Yukio Lippit, a professor of art history and architecture at Harvard.",
      "\u201cIse is unique because of attrition \u2014 renewal cycles are difficult to maintain \u2014 and because of the vagaries of history; many other shrines that once underwent regular rebuilding have stopped doing so,\u201d Lippit said.",
      "During a recent downpour, priests in starched robes banged drums and marched to Ise's inner shrines for prayers marking the beginning of the age-old rebuilding process.",
      "\u201cThe world where we live and the mountain realm are separate, distinct worlds. Therefore, when people go onto the mountain to cut trees or gather plants, they must first receive permission from the mountain deities,\" according to Okada, the historian.",
      "Thousands gather to see the rebuilding ceremonies, part of about 7 million pilgrims a year who converge on the shrine, which has long been the polestar for Shinto devotees. Japan\u2019s indigenous Shinto faith, which also acts as a cultural connection for family and community, is largely rooted in animism. In Shinto there are thousands of \u201ckami,\u201d or spirits, that inhabit the world. While Ise thrives, the number of Shinto shrines has plummeted in recent decades as Japan\u2019s population shrinks and young people increasingly move from the countryside to megacities.",
      "\u201cYou can count with one hand the number of times you\u2019ll witness something like this in your lifetime, so I really felt it was a rare and precious sight,\u201d said Yuto Nakase, who was viewing the ceremonies for the first time.",

      "\u201cMy breathing changes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really feels different. What I sense also changes. The sounds, the wind or nature, seem to release my stress. \u2026 There\u2019s a kind of depth there that, for me, makes it a very comforting and pleasant space.\u201d",
      "In the forests of Nagano prefecture, a woodcutter takes the tip of a freshly felled tree and inserts it into the stump of another tree that has just been cut down. The assembled woodcutters then pray and bow together in front of the stump, commemorating these special cypresses that will be used to rebuild Ise.",
      "\u201cIt honors the continuity of a tree\u2019s life and is a prayer for the regeneration of the forest,\u201d explains Soju Ikeda, who operates a local lumber company and manages a society for the preservation of traditional tree-felling skills. \u201cYou take a moment to appreciate that trees are living beings and engrave that feeling into your heart.\u201d",
      "Over the following days, dozens of men dressed in traditional clothing drag the two-ton logs through the Isuzu River to the shrine, chanting rhythmically as they pull, knee-deep in the water.",
      "At Ise there are ten carpenters\u2019 studios in permanent residence, plus others who are brought in, Lippit, the Harvard professor, said. The miscanthus reed thatch for the shrine's roofs is specially grown to a length of over 2 meters; this takes about eight years and is timed for the rebuilding.",
      "Cypress groves are specially planted at Ise for the constant construction, and their cultivation often exceeds individual human lifespans, with responsibilities for the trees passed from generation to generation.",
      "Asked about his relationship to the cypress trees that are cultivated for the shrine, Ikeda, the lumber expert, had a one-word answer: \u201cDeep.\u201d",
      "Forty years ago, when he was 24, he drove his grandfather to participate in the tree-felling ceremony. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Do you know that the trees cry?\u2019",
      "\"I answered, \u2018No way, how could a tree cry?\u2019\"",
      "But as they watched woodsmen chop down the cypress, \u201cthe sound of the axes echoed across the mountains, and after about an hour, when the axe struck the core of the tree, the scent of the cypress filled the air, flowing like blood,\u201d he said.",
      "At the final axe stroke, as the wood snapped, \u201cthe sound it made was like a shriek, a high-pitched \u2018keee\u2019 sound, and then the tree fell with a thunderous thud. In that moment, I thought, \u2018Ah... it really cried.\u2019 I felt as if the tree wept, mourning its own life, as if it knew its life was precious.\u201d",

The swift verdict arrived hours after jurors were sent to deliberate on Tuesday morning.",
      "Lee was charged with killing Minu Jo, 6, and Yuna Jo, 8, in June 2018. The children\u2019s remains were found inside luggage at an abandoned storage unit in Auckland in August 2022.",
      "Lee, who is a New Zealand citizen, had traveled to South Korea and changed her name in 2018, shortly after the children are believed to have been killed. She was born in South Korea and went by the name Ji Eun Lee previously.",
      "The 45-year-old woman was extradited from South Korea in November 2022. She denied the charges, with her lawyers arguing that she was insane at the time of the murders.",
      "Lawyers for Lee admitted she had killed the children by giving them an anti-depressant medication, but they said the deaths happened after their client \u201cdescended into madness,\" Lorraine Smith said. Lee had always been \u201cfragile,\u201d said Smith, but her mental illness became worse after her husband's death.",

      "Bourbon production at Buffalo Trace Distillery has been connected to the Kentucky River for decades",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- The long history of bourbon production at Buffalo Trace Distillery has been connected to the Kentucky River \u2014 summed up as a blessing and curse by a plaque on the grounds.",
      "In the 1800s, long before the Buffalo Trace name was attached to the distillery, the river served as a floating highway to bring in grain and other production essentials and to transport barrels of whiskey to markets along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Even today, river water cools down production equipment. But the river flowing past the distillery flashed its destructive side in April.",
      "A massive flood, caused by days of unrelenting rain, sent the Kentucky River surging over its banks, inundating most of the 200-plus-acre distillery grounds on its main campus in Frankfort. Nearly every phase of production was impacted, as were several warehouses where whiskey is aged.",
      "\u201cIt was just something that was hard to process, but we knew we couldn\u2019t take too much time to process it,\" said Tyler Adams, a distillery general manager. He said they had much to do to recover from the reservoir of murky water that swamped the bourbon-making campus.",
      "Five months later, production at the distillery is back to normal, including of some of the most sought-after bourbons. Its lineup includes the namesake flagship brand, Buffalo Trace, as well as Eagle Rare, W.L. Weller and Blanton's. Pappy Van Winkle bourbons are distilled and aged at Buffalo Trace while the Van Winkle family remains in control of the coveted brand.",
      "The distillery recently filled its 9 millionth barrel of bourbon since Prohibition, just two and a half years since filling the 8 millionth barrel. It has also introduced new whiskeys to its catalogue and is renovating a campus building into a cafe and events center.",
      "The cleanup enlisted hundreds of plant employees and contract workers. Buffalo Trace fans swamped the distillery with offers to pitch in, Adams said. The distillery politely declined and suggested they might assist area residents instead.",
      "Crews removed debris, sanitized equipment and pumped out what was left after floodwaters receded. Bourbon barrels swept into the parking lot caught some attention, Adams said. No chance for sneak samples, though \u2014 the barrels were empty.",
      "Few visible reminders remain of that mud-caked, debris-strewn mess.",
      "Some filled whiskey barrels touched by floodwaters were still being cleaned and tested, but the meticulous task of examining thousands of barrels was nearly complete, the distillery said. Quality control assessments found only small amounts of aging whiskey were impacted. High water marks are etched into some buildings and tour guides casually remind visitors of the epic event.",
      "Danny Kahn, a master distiller for Buffalo Trace's parent company, says he still experiences \"a little PTSD\u201d when recalling those frantic days. River flooding has been a sporadic part of the distillery's history \u2014 including big ones in 1937 and 1978, but in early April, the floodwaters surged to previously unseen heights.

      "Once the river crested, it took a few days for the floodwaters to fully recede, but operations gradually sprung back to life. Finished whiskey shipped out the day after the rain stopped. Bottling soon resumed and a makeshift gift shop opened until the visitors' center was repaired. Tours eventually resumed. But bourbon production halted for about a month as the cost for cleanup and repairs surpassed $30 million.",

Now the government wants to raise it to 260,000 over the next decade, and says it will also need around 200,000 reservists, more than double the current figure.",

      "F-35 fighter jets, Chinook transport helicopters, Leopard 2 tanks, frigates and other hardware are on order after a 100 billion-euro ($117 billion) special fund was set up in 2022 to modernize the Bundeswehr, but they will take time to arrive. This year, Merz\u2019s new coalition enabled higher spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt, a big step for a historically debt-averse nation.",

A report by the parliamentary commissioner for the military earlier this year said that some remaining barracks and other facilities are still in a \u201cdisastrous\u201d state after years of penny-pinching. A program to build new military accommodation now aims to build 76 new buildings by 2031.",
      "The Cabinet last month approved plans for a new military service system meant to tackle the personnel challenge. It foresees more attractive pay and conditions for people who join up on a short-term basis, better training and more flexibility on how long people can serve.",
      "The aim is to draw sufficient recruits without reviving conscription, an idea unpopular with the center-left junior partner in Merz\u2019s coalition, but the plan leaves the door open to do so if not enough people volunteer.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tariffs and years of teetering mall traffic have roiled much of the toy industry. But Build-A-Bear investors are continuing to reap sizeable gains.",
      "Shares of Build-A-Bear Workshop are up more than 60% since the start of 2025, trading at just under $72 apiece as of Tuesday afternoon. That compares to just 13% for the S&P 500 since the start of the year, and marks dramatic growth from five years ago, when the St. Louis-based retailer's stock sat under $3.",
      "The toy industry overall has been \u201creasonably soft\u201d in recent years, notes Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData \u2014 but certain categories, including craft-oriented products, have done very well following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. And that's key to Build-A-Bear's core business model: welcoming consumers into their brick-and-mortar stores to make their own plush animals.",
      "That may also set Build-A-Bear apart from the malls its stores are often inside, many of which have struggled to see overall traffic rebound over the years.",
      "\u201cThe mall may not be a destination, but Build-A-Bear often is \u2014 because it\u2019s often a planned trip,\" Saunders said. \u201cIt\u2019s a store within a mall that many consumers make a beeline for.\u201d",
      "Build-A-Bear is still not isn\u2019t entirely immune to macroeconomic pressures, but the company's profit has soared to record after record in recent quarters. Last month, the retailer reported what it said were the best results for a second quarter and first half of a fiscal year in the history of the Build-A-Bear, which opened its first store in 1997. Company executives pointed to strong store performance and other expansion efforts.",
      "In the first half of its 2025 fiscal year, the company\u2019s revenues hit $252.6 million and its pre-tax income climbed to $34.9 million \u2014 up 11.5% and 31.5%, respectively, year-over-year.",
      "The company also raised its financial outlook for the full year, despite anticipated costs of President Donald Trump's steep tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world and other headwinds.",

      "\u201cTariffs are a real cost that we are facing,\u201d Voin Todorovic, chief financial officer at Build-A-Bear, said in the company's Aug. 28 earnings call \u2014 pointing to current U.S. import tax rates of 30% on China and 20% on Vietnam, where the retailer sources much of its products. Some of that has already trickled down to the cost of Build-A-Bear's merchandise in North America, but Todorovic noted that such levies would impact the company \"even more in the second half of the year.\u201d",
      "Still, he and other executives pointed to preparations Build-A-Bear had made to lessen the blow, including previous inventory increases. The company also maintained that consumer-facing price impacts would be limited.",
      "While the retailer offers some ready-made toys and toy clothing, \"what Build-A-Bear generally buys is materials,\u201d Saunders noted. This can \u201chedge against tariffs much more effectively,\" he explained, as they reduce labor costs and potentially allow for more flexibility on sourcing.",
      "Still, Saunders notes that everyone is going to be affected by tariffs and Build-A-Bear isn't an exception. He adds that consumers will probably \u201ceat that extra cost because they're paying for the entertainment value.\"",
      "Barring any significant changes, Todorovic said in August's earnings call that tariffs are anticipated to cost Build-A-Bear under $11 million for the 2025 fiscal year. But despite that and other costs, he noted that the company is still on track to approach or slightly beat last year's earnings.",
      "The company's latest guidance expects its pre-tax income to reach between $62 million to $70 million for the full 2025 fiscal year, compared to just over $67 million reported in 2024.",

      "\u201cAt the end of the day, I make my own analysis based on my own understanding of economics and how the economy works,\u201d Miran said. In his conversations with Trump, the president \"never asked me to set policy in a specific way.\u201d",
      "In his speech, Miran said, \u201cit should be clear that my view of appropriate monetary policy diverges from those of other\" members of the committee. \u201cI view policy as very restrictive,\u201d he added, meaning that it is holding back the economy and \u201cposes material risks\u201d to the Fed's congressional mandate of seeking maximum employment.",
      "Miran said that fewer immigrants should free up more housing and lower rental costs, reducing inflationary pressures. And tariff revenues \u2014 which may top $300 billion a year, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates \u2014 should reduce the deficit, he added. Over time, that would mean the Fed doesn't have to keep its benchmark interest rate as high as it is now to bring inflation down.",

      "After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising.",
      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",
      "Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a \u201cremedy\u201d trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions.",
      "Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission.",
      "No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined.",
      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",
      "If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology \u2014 a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would \u201cinvite disruption and damage\u201d to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",
      "Google believes it has already made enough changes to its \u201cAd Manager\u201d system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling.,",

      "The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct.",
      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \u201cradical\u201d proposals.",
      "The Justice Department is \u201cfighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,\" Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial.",

      "The nation\u2019s largest railroad union endorsed Union Pacific\u2019s proposed $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern Monday after securing promises to protect jobs",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The nation's largest railroad union joined the list of companies endorsing Union Pacific's proposed $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern Monday after securing promises to protect jobs, but other unions and chemical makers that rely on the railroads are still expressing concerns about the deal.",
      "The SMART-TD union that represents conductors and other rail workers said Union Pacific put CEO Jim Vena's promise not to lay off any of its workers as a result of the merger in writing and promised to protect their jobs throughout their careers. But the head of one of the next biggest unions said he doesn't think this deal does nearly enough to protect rail jobs, so he's not ready to support the merger that would create the nation's first transcontinental railroad.",
      "The union's endorsement comes just days after President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he deal sounds good to him, but groups like the American Chemistry Council and the Rail Customer Coalition have said they worry that allowing two of the six largest railroads to merge will only hurt competition and lead to even higher shipping rates.",
      "The president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union said he believes his Teamsters have enough influence with the White House that he may be able to change Trump's mind once he gets a chance to explain some of the details and the tactics he believes the railroad will use to eliminate jobs.",
      "But SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson, who initially criticized the merger and promised to oppose it, said Monday that he now believes it is for the best after the railroad promised to protect jobs.",
      "\u201cFor generations, railroaders have worried about what mergers might mean for their jobs and whether or not they would be given the opportunity to reach retirement on the rail,\" Ferguson said. \u201cToday, we can say with confidence that the biggest railroad and the biggest rail union in America are breaking new ground. We are protecting jobs, protecting families, and protecting the future of the U.S. supply chain.\u201d",
      "Tony Cardwell, president of the BMWED, said his union rejected similar offer from Union Pacific a couple weeks ago because the railroad wouldn't agree to protect workers if it decides to lease more of its tracks to short-line railroads to handle the final deliveries as it has already done in a couple locations. He said what good is a promise of a job if it means either taking a pay cut to go to work for a smaller railroad or moving across the country to keep a job with Union Pacific.",
      "Cardwell said that until workers in those situations are protected \u201cWe're not going to support it. In fact, we'll vehemently deny it. And we feel like we have a close enough relationship right now with the White House that we can have an impact on this.\u201d",
      "Trump's opinion of the deal could prove crucial because he'll appoint two more Republican members of the Surface Transportation Board that will ultimately decide whether to approve the largest rail merger in history. Just last month, Trump fired one of the two Democratic members of the board.",
      "The president of the American Chemistry Council trade group, Chris Jahn said he's worried that this proposed acquisition will follow the pattern of problems that followed past rail mergers in the 1990s. Deliveries were delayed and disrupted for extended periods after both the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific deal and the Conrail acquisition.",
      "\u201cHistory has shown that mergers slash service and shift costs onto customers \u2014 and the UP\u2013NS merger risks more of the same,\" Jahn said. \u201cPresident Trump has made real progress rebuilding American manufacturing. Let\u2019s not let a monopoly undo it.\u201d",

      "\u201cBy knitting together a coast-to-coast rail network, Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern are creating new efficiencies that will benefit everyone \u2013 from logistics providers like us, to our customers, to the end consumers,\u201d said Adam Miller, CEO of Knight-Swift Transportation. His company is a major shipper that trucks metal goods to railroads and then pays them to haul the trailers across the country before Knight-Swift picks them up again with its trucks to deliver them.",
      "Frank Vingerhoets said he believes combining the two railroads will help his company's plastics reach their destinations more quickly and efficiently.",
      "\u201cIt means the plastic pellets and other products we handle can reach key markets faster and more seamlessly than ever. In short, it\u2019s a win for shippers and for the entire supply chain,\" said Vingerhoets, who is president of Katoen Natie North America.",
      "The STB review of the deal could take up to two years to complete. The board established a high bar for major rail mergers after the problems of the past, but Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern executives have expressed confidence in their chances of gaining approval.",
      "\u201cI am confident we will unlock new sources of growth for the country and our industry, taking more trucks off taxpayer-funded highways, serving new markets, and keeping more railroad jobs in America,\" said Vena, the Union Pacific CEO.",

      "The parasite, a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly, attacks warm-blooded animals, including humans. Mexico has reported more than 500 active cases in cattle across southern states.",
      "The block on cattle imports has spelled trouble for Mexico's government, which has already been busy trying to offset the brunt of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats this year.",
      "The government and ranchers have sought to get the ban lifted. If it stays in place through the year, Mexico's ranching federation estimates losses up to $400 million.",

      "Jury selection began Monday, with opening statements to follow.",
      "Prime provides subscribers with perks that include faster shipping, video streaming and discounts at Whole Foods for a fee of $139 annually, or $14.99 a month.",
      "It's a key \u2014 and growing \u2014 part of Amazon's business, with more than 200 million members. In its latest quarterly report, the company in July reported more than $12 billion in net revenue for subscription services, which is a 12% increase from the same period last year. That figure includes annual and monthly fees associated with Prime memberships, as well as other subscription services such as its music and e-books platforms.",
      "The company said it does clearly explain Prime's terms before charging customers, and that it offers simple ways to cancel membership, including by phone, online and by online chat.",
      "\u201cOccasional customer frustrations and mistakes are inevitable \u2014 especially for a program as popular as Amazon Prime,\u201d Amazon said in a trial brief filed last week. \u201cEvidence that a small percentage of customers misunderstood Prime enrollment or cancellation does not prove that Amazon violated the law.\u201d",

He also limited some of the legal defenses Amazon may offer at trial and sided with the FTC on its claim that Amazon violated the law by collecting customers' billing information before disclosing Prime's terms.",
      "But Chun said several other issues remain for the jury to decide, including whether Amazon\u2019s disclosures of the material terms of Prime membership are \u201cclear and conspicuous\u201d and whether the \u201cIlliad\u201d cancellation method is \u201csimple,\u201d as the law requires.",
      "Chun also ruled that two Amazon executives named as individual defendants \u2014 Neil Lindsay and Jamil Ghani \u2014 were so entwined with the Prime program that they will personally face liability if the jury sides with the FTC. A third, Russell Grandinetti, could also potentially face personal liability if the jury so decides.",
      "Amazon said a statement Monday: \u201cThe bottom line is that neither Amazon nor the individual defendants did anything wrong \u2014 we remain confident that the facts will show these executives acted properly and we always put customers first.\u201d",
      "The FTC, which declined to comment Monday, began looking into Amazon's Prime subscription practices in 2021 during the first Trump administration, but the lawsuit was filed in 2023 under former FTC Chair Lina Khan, an antitrust expert who had been appointed by Biden.",
      "The agency filed the case months before it submitted an antitrust lawsuit against the retail and technology company, accusing it of having monopolistic control over online markets.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday extended a signature state program aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions through 2045, a move Democrats cheered but Republicans warned would raise gas prices.",
      "The program known as cap and trade sets a declining limit on total greenhouse gas emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their pollution. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.",
      "It was set to expire after 2030. The law Newsom signed Friday at the Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco potentially boosts carbon-removal projects and requires the program to align with California's target of achieving so-called carbon neutrality by 2045. That means the state will remove as many carbon emissions as it releases. The law changes the name to \u201ccap and invest\u201d to emphasize that the money goes toward other programs.",

      "Newsom also signed a law committing $1 billion in program revenue for the state\u2019s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.",
      "He approved other measures aimed at advancing the state\u2019s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians. They include laws to speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze and allow the state\u2019s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states.",
      "Newsom also signed a bill that would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.",
      "California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state\u2019s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.",

The program's \u201ccap\u201d applies to planet-warming emissions, not other pollutants impacting air quality. Cap and trade doesn't set emissions limits for individual facilities, meaning an industrial polluter could continue to emit the same amount of greenhouse gases over time so long as it has the right amount of credits or offsets.",
      "Other critics of the cap-and-trade extension are worried about it raising costs. The program has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played \u201ca very small role\u201d in increasing electricity prices because the state\u2019s grid isn\u2019t very carbon intensive, the report says.",

Tony Strickland said in a statement. \u201cTheir idea of tackling affordability is extending the Cap-and-Trade program, a hidden tax that drives up costs on everything from gas to groceries. That\u2019s not climate leadership. I call it economic sabotage.\u201d",
      "But Democratic Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, who wrote the reauthorization bill, said it will help the state fight climate change because \u201cthe cost of inaction is immeasurable.\u201d She referenced the devastating wildfire that ripped through Pacific Palisades in her district in January.",
      "Daniel Barad, the western states acting co-director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said last week that the extension comes at a key time.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark rate for the first time since last year, but that doesn't guarantee mortgage rates will keep dropping",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Hoping that mortgage rates will keep dropping following the Federal Reserve's first rate cut since last year? Don't bank on it.",
      "As expected, the central bank delivered a quarter-point cut Wednesday and projected it would lower its benchmark rate twice more this year, reflecting growing concern over the U.S. job market.",
      "Here's a look at factors that determine mortgage rates and what the Fed's latest move means for the housing market:",
      "Mortgage rates have been mostly falling since late July on expectations of a Fed rate cut. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage was at 6.35% last week, its lowest level in nearly a year, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.",
      "A similar pullback in mortgage rates happened around this time last year in the weeks leading up to the Fed\u2019s first rate cut in more than four years. Back then, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage got down to a 2-year low of 6.08% one week after the central bank cut rates.",
      "But it hasn't come close to that since.",
      "Mortgage rates didn't keep falling last year, even as the Fed cut its main rate two more times. Instead, mortgage rates rose and kept climbing until the average rate on a 30-year home loan reached just over 7% by mid-January.",
      "Like last year, the Fed's rate cut doesn't necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining, even as the central bank signals more cuts ahead.",
      "\u201cRates could come down further, as the Fed has signaled the potential for two more rate cuts this year,\u201d said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. \u201cHowever, there are still risks of a reversal in mortgage rates. Inflation heated up in August and if the September inflation report shows another bump in consumer prices, it\u2019s possible we could see rates rise.\u201d",
      "No. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Fed's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "Mortgage rates generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "That's because mortgages are typically bundled into mortgage-backed securities that are sold to investors. To keep mortgage-backed securities attractive to investors, their yield \u2014 or annual return -- is adjusted to be competitive with the yield offered by the U.S. on its 10-year government bonds. When those bond yields rise, they tend to push up mortgage rates, and vice-versa.",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield has been mostly easing since mid-July as growing signs that the job market has been weakening fueled expectations of a Fed rate cut this month.",
      "Until now, the Fed had kept its main interest rate on hold this year because it was more worried about inflation potentially worsening due to the Trump administration's tariffs than about the job market.",
      "At the same time, inflation has so far refused to go back below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "When the Fed cuts rates that can give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it can also fuel inflation. That, in turn, could push up mortgage rates.",

      "\u201cIt's not just about what the Fed is doing today, it\u2019s about what they\u2019re expected to do in the future, and that\u2019s determined by things like economic growth, what\u2019s going to happen in the labor market and what do we think inflation is going to be like over the next year or so,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cIf the Fed keeps lowering rates, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mortgages will go down,\u201d said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIt means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don\u2019t move in lockstep.\u201d",
      "Ahead of the Fed's rate cut, the futures market had priced in expectations that the central bank would cut its key interest rate at upcoming policy meetings this year and into 2026. But the Fed's latest projections show a less aggressive path of rate cuts than the market has been expecting.",
      "\u201cThis ongoing gap between market and Fed expectations means that some risk of upward pressure on mortgage rates remains,\u201d said Hale, adding that the decline in mortgage rates \u201cis likely to continue at least through this week.\"",
      "Hale recently forecast that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will be between 6.3% and 6.4% by the end of this year. That's in line with recent projections by other economists who also don't expect the average rate to drop below 6% this year.",
      "The late-summer pullback in mortgage rates has been a welcome trend for the housing market, which has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years and have remained sluggish so far this year.",
      "While lower rates give home shoppers more purchasing power, mortgage rates remain too high for many Americans to afford to buy a home. That\u2019s mostly because home prices, while rising more slowly than in years past, are still up by roughly 50% nationally since the start of this decade.",
      "\u201cWhile lower rates will bring some buyers and sellers into the market, today\u2019s cut will not be enough to break up the housing market logjam,\u201d said Sturtevant. \"We will need to see further drops in mortgage rates and much slower home price growth, or even home price declines, to make a dent in affordability.\u201d",
      "If mortgage rates continue to ease, home shoppers will benefit from more affordable financing. But lower mortgage rates could also bring in more buyers, making the market more competitive at a time when sellers across the country are having a tougher time driving a hard bargain.",
      "Predicting when mortgage rates will decline and by how much is daunting because so many variables can influence their trajectory from one week to the next.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current rates may be better off buying now if they find a property that fits their needs, rather than attempt to time the market, said Kates.",
      "Many homeowners looking to refinance have already seized on the decline in rates, sending applications for refinance loans sharply higher in recent weeks.",
      "One rule of thumb to consider when refinancing is whether you can reduce your current rate by at least one percentage point, which helps blunt the impact of refinancing fees.",

      "Mike Gundy, one of college football\u2019s most colorful coaches over the last two decades, was fired by Oklahoma State on Tuesday.",
      "The 58-year-old Gundy had a career record of 170-90 at his alma mater, where he was a star quarterback in the late 1980s. He posted winning records every season from 2006 to 2023, but had losing records in his final two years.",

      "Gundy arrived as head coach in 2005, and the Oklahoma City native's charm and sense of humor appealed to fans and recruits and helped the Cowboys compete with better-funded programs. As late billionaire T. Boone Pickens poured millions into the program, Gundy turned Oklahoma State into an unlikely powerhouse that often affected the national championship race. The Cowboys won the Big 12 in 2011 and played in the Big 12 title game in 2021 and 2023.",
      "But the Cowboys couldn\u2019t keep up as college football changed. The transfer portal and NIL made it more difficult for a coach who made his name mining diamonds in the rough. Gundy lost 11 of his final 12 games with the program. In his final two seasons, he emerged as a refreshingly open and honest voice about the changes in the sport.",
      "On Monday, Gundy said he wanted to stay.",
      "\u201cEver since I was hired, I\u2019ve put my heart and soul into this, and I\u2019ll continue to do that until I don\u2019t want to do it anymore, or until someone else says we don\u2019t want you to do it,\u201d he said.",
      "For all his positives, Gundy came with quirks. He is known as much for his \u201cI\u2019m a man, I\u2019m 40\u201d rant that he made defending a player \u2014 a diatribe that remains a part of pop culture through a Consumer Cellular commercial \u2014 as for his success.",

There were tears for the Americans as they gathered on the first tee at sunrise and a strong reminder for Europe as it goes after a rare road win.",

      "The Americans have lost at home only four times since the Ryder Cup began in 1927. European captain Luke Donald had his team wear salmon-colored pullovers or sweater vests, a subtle reminder of what can be done.",
      "That was the Sunday color for the European team in 1987 when it stunned the Americans at Muirfield Village to win its first Ryder Cup away from home. Europe has won three more times on U.S. soil since then, the most recent 13 years ago in what became known as the \u201cMiracle at Medinah\u201d because of the Sunday rally.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Bernie Parent, the Hall of Famer considered one of the great goalies of all time who anchored the net for the Philadelphia Flyers' only two Stanley Cup championships during their Broad Street Bullies heyday, has died. He was 80.",
      "The Flyers made the announcement Sunday but provided no immediate details. Parent died overnight in his sleep, said Joe Watson, a star defenseman on their Stanley Cup teams.",
      "Parent's steel-eyed stare through his old-school hockey mask landed him on the cover of Time magazine in 1975 when the Flyers reigned as one of the marquee teams in sports. He won Stanley Cup, Conn Smythe and Vezina trophies in back-to-back seasons when the Flyers won the Stanley Cup in 1974 and 1975, the first NHL expansion team to win the championship.",
      "After he made his NHL debut with Boston in 1965, Parent was left unprotected by the Bruins in the 1967 expansion draft and was selected by the Flyers. After 3 1/2 seasons, he was traded to Toronto but ended up back in Philadelphia ahead of the 1973-74 season. He won a league-high 47 games that season and led the NHL in wins again the next season with 44.",
      "He retired with the Flyers in 1979 after 271 wins \u2014 231 of them with the Flyers \u2014 over a 13-year career. Parent was accidentally struck in the right eye with a stick in 1979 and was temporarily blinded. He never played again.",
      "The Flyers beat the Bruins in six games to win the Stanley Cup in 1974 and beat Buffalo in 1975.",
      "On the flight home from Buffalo, the Flyers plopped the Stanley Cup in the middle of the aisle. For close to 90 minutes, the Flyers couldn\u2019t take their eyes off the ultimate prize.",

Bernie!\u201d echoed throughout the park for the affable goalie, who played 5 minutes, 32 seconds and stopped all six shots. Each save made the \u201cBernie!\u201d chants return.",

      "Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service\u2019s New York field office, said agents found multiple sites filled with servers and stacked SIM cards, of which more than 100,000 cards were already active. Though the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, he described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise and possibly run by nation-state actors \u2014 perpetrators from particular countries.",

      "So what are these SIM farms and what are they capable of?",
      "SIM farms are hardware devices that can hold numerous SIM cards from different mobile operators. These devices then exploit voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology to send and receive bulk messages or calls.",

      "\u201cSo if you can imagine that type of magnitude on cellular networks, it would just overwhelm them and cause them to shut down,\u201d Ferrante said in an interview.

      "Ferrante, who previously served in key security positions at the White House and the FBI, says he's awaiting the results of the investigation before drawing any conclusions about the nature of the setup, but he emphasizes that the scale of the operation shows how simple tools can pose real risks to critical infrastructure.",

      "The Trump administration wants to redistribute $2.4 billion it pulled from California\u2019s high-speed rail project to other uses as part of a new $5 billion program to fund rail projects that boost U.S. rail passenger traffic",
      "The Trump administration wants to redistribute $2.4 billion it pulled from California's high-speed rail project as part of a new $5 billion program announced Monday to fund rail projects to boost passenger rail traffic nationwide.",
      "The new program's rules for states and others wanting to participate remove any mention of diversity or climate change dating to the Biden administration. The new program will also put a priority on projects in areas with higher rates of birth and marriage and projects that improve safety at railroad crossings.",
      "The Trump administration has removed climate change and so-called DEI language from other grant requirements, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took a jab at that Biden-era language and California Gov. Gavin Newsom's rail project in his announcement.",
      "\u201cOur new National Railroad Partnership Program will emphasize safety \u2013 our number one priority \u2013 without the radical ... DEI and green grant requirements. Instead of wasting dollars on Governor Newsom\u2019s high-speed rail boondoggle, these targeted investments will improve the lives of rail passengers, local drivers, and pedestrians,\" Duffy said.",
      "The biggest chunk of this money the Federal Railroad Administration announced comes from the $4 billion that was pulled from the California project. The rest of the money comes from a combination of what was announced last year and what is in this year\u2019s budget.",
      "President Donald Trump and Duffy have both criticized the decades-old California project for its cost overruns and many delays that have kept the train that's designed to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles from becoming a reality.",
      "California officials said they will fight the effort to redistribute money they believe should be going to their project. They had already filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision to pull federal funding from the rail project.",
      "\u201cThe FRA\u2019s decision to terminate federal funding for California high-speed rail was unlawful, unwarranted, and is being challenged in federal court. Now, their attempt to redirect a portion of that funding, currently the subject of litigation, is premature,\u201d said Micah Flores, a spokesman for the California High-Speed Rail Authority. \u201cThe Authority has been prepared for this possibility and will take imminent legal action to block this misguided effort by the FRA.\u201d",
      "The focus on areas with higher birth and marriage rates reflects Trump's executive orders that make spending that benefits American families a priority in his administration, according to an FRA spokesman.",

      "The Federal Railroad Administration said railroad crossings are important to address because more than 200 people a year are killed when trains collide with vehicles or pedestrians at crossings. That has long been something the government and railroads have worked to address, but it is costly to build bridges or underpasses that allow cars to safely bypass the tracks.",
      "Even though the money is targeted toward improving passenger rail, some of it will almost certainly go to improvements on the nation's major freight railroads because Amtrak uses their tracks for most of its long-distance routes across the country.",

      "Applications for this money are due by Jan. 7.",

      "Ahead of Sunday's vote to choose a new 101-seat legislature, multiple online monitoring groups have tracked propaganda and disinformation campaigns attributed to Russia. Their aim is to diminish support for the ruling pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity, or PAS, in a vote many view as a geopolitical choice between East and West.",
      "Researchers say the coordinated campaigns mark a new phase in Russian influence operations, built on fresh infrastructure and heavy use of AI. Spoof websites impersonate legitimate Western media and pay \u201cengagement farms\u201d in Africa, while AI bots are deployed to flood comment sections deriding PAS and the EU.",

      "Moldovan authorities have long warned that Russia is conducting a hybrid war \u2014 meddling in elections, disinformation campaigns, illicitly funding pro-Russian parties \u2014 to try to derail the country\u2019s path toward EU membership. Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in Moldova.",
      "Reset Tech, a global not-for-profit that monitors digital threats to democracy and Russian online influence operations since 2022, investigated an English-language AI-generated platform Restmedia, which proclaims to be \u201ccommitted to exposing and addressing the critical issues shaping Europe\u2019s future.\u201d",
      "While Restmedia mimics investigative journalism with serious-looking articles and well-designed graphics, all of its content is generated using AI tools, according to a report by Reset Tech shared with The Associated Press. About a quarter of its content focuses on Moldova, but is \u201ctranslated and amplified\u201d by websites in other EU languages. It publishes \u201cKremlin-aligned propaganda\u201d attacking Sandu, PAS and the EU.",
      "Disinformation refers to misinformation created and spread intentionally, mainly to confuse or mislead.",
      "\u201cWe have learned to detect the fingerprints of these Russian secret services in lots of different countries ... and seen them really active in Moldova,\u201d Ben Scott, the director of Reset Tech, told the AP. \u201cAnd not surprising, because Moldova has some very critical elections.\"",
      "The 36-page report reveals that Restmedia pays \u201cengagement farms\u201d in Africa to promote its narratives across verified accounts on X in a \u201camplification-for-hire\u201d schemes. Although Restmedia tried to \u201cmask its infrastructure,\u201d researchers found \u201cclear technical links to Russia\u201d via IP addresses and website metadata.",

      "Between Aug. 5 and Sept. 4, Expert Forum, a Romanian think tank monitoring the Moldovan election, said it tracked 100 inauthentic TikTok accounts that garnered a total of 13.9 million views in a campaign driven by \u201cfear and resentment,\u201d mostly attacking PAS. The NGO later found a \u201cmirror network\u201d of the 100 TikTok accounts on Facebook.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing today is fundamentally different from classic disinformation campaigns,\u201d it said. \u201cAI can generate complete profiles, realistic photos, credible biographies, and varied content in minutes that would have required weeks of manual work.\u201d",
      "Promo-Lex, a Moldovan nonprofit monitoring the election, also found 500 fake TikTok accounts that posted the same videos, graphics, and anti-EU and anti-Sandu narratives, which racked up 1.3 million views in three days. Driven by 25 \u201ccore accounts,\u201d the network used two election-related hashtags to \u201cmanipulate TikTok\u2019s algorithm to force posts\" into trending.",
      "The Moldovan government has tried to counter the slew. On Sept. 16, Sandu signed a decree approving the establishment of a center to counter disinformation.",
      "One site that mimics the U.S. lifestyle outlet OK! Magazine ran a fabricated story titled \u201cMoldovan president in celebrity sperm scandal!\u201d and falsely used the name of a real reporter. It alleged that Sandu \u2014 who is unmarried and does not have children \u2014 was purchasing sperm from gay celebrity donors such as Ricky Martin and Elton John to have a child.",
      "\u201cThe article seeks to discredit Sandu by weaponizing gender stereotypes and targeting her personal life, while eroding her political reputation,\u201d the Reset Tech report states.",
      "Another article on a fake news site referenced as its primary source a report by the EU-sanctioned Russian Foundation to Battle Injustice, which accuses Sandu of running a child trafficking campaign via Ukraine to pedophile networks in Europe.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin operatives are using AI, cheap, off-the-shelf software to create quick and dirty images for lookalike websites,\u201d Scott said. \u201cNot only does it bring false information to voters who are trying to consider very consequential issues in their country, but also over time it leads people to believe that nothing can be trusted.\u201d",
      "Reset Tech said the network uses methods and digital assets that link it to a broader Russian information influence network, often referred to as Storm-1516. Its analysis built on research by Recorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group and the Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which is made up of DFRLab, EU Disinfo Lab, Alliance4Europe, and Debunk.",
      "Fugitive pro-Russian Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor, who was convicted of fraud and reportedly lives in exile in Moscow, has been accused of funding a large Russia-backed network of paid political ads on Facebook and YouTube ahead of the election.",
      "Between April 30 and July 28, a network led by Shor and several other political actors paid for 1,505 advertisements on Meta platforms with a budget estimated at 45,000 euros ($53,000), according to the Chisinau-based think tank WatchDog. Hundreds of adverts were also placed on YouTube.",
      "During the period WatchDog monitored, the main \u201cpropaganda narratives\u201d promoted across the two platforms were that PAS will rig the election, persecutes the Orthodox Church of Moldova, and claims that the pro-EU party has impoverished Moldova.",
      "Moldovan authorities conducted a series of raids in the run-up to the election, as part of investigations into voter corruption, illegal party financing and money laundering, allegedly tied to the Shor \u201ccriminal organization.\u201d",
      "During a raid on Sept. 18 in which one person was detained, police said they seized cash, laptops, bank documents, and that the suspects were receiving instructions via Telegram from \u201ccurators in the Russian Federation\u201d on how to distribute and comment on disinformation videos on Facebook, TikTok and Telegram. Shor has denied wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cWe know how to fight Russian propaganda (and) pro-Russian oligarchs,\u201d says Andrei Rusu, a media monitoring expert at WatchDog. \u201cBut we need more support from our partners. \u2026 Words will not save our country from a pro-Russian regime if this election will be corrupted.\u201d",

      "As AI increasingly becomes a part of daily life, it's found a foothold in medical care \u2014 providing everything from note-taking during exams to electronic nurses. While heralded by some for the efficiency it brings, others worry about its impact on patient care.",
      "Robin is about 30% autonomous, while a team of operators working remotely controls the rest under the watchful eyes of clinical staff. Khachikyan said that with each interaction, they\u2019re able to collect more data \u2014 while still complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA \u2014 and get closer to it being able to function independently.",
      "\u201cImagine a pure emotional intelligence like WALL-E. We\u2019re trying to create that,\u201d he said, referencing the 2008 animated film.",
      "On a recent Friday, a staff member at HealthBridge Children\u2019s Hospital in Orange County, California, read off a list of patients she needed Robin to visit, along with the amount of time to spend with each one.",
      "The robot with a sleek white triangle-shaped frame that Khachikyan said was designed for hugging, rolled into a room with a teenager injured in a car accident. The robot played what it described as his favorite song \u2014 \u201cNo Fear\u201d by DeJ Loaf \u2014 and he danced along. In the hallway, Robin cracked up a young child held by her mother when it put on a series of silly glasses and a big red nose. In another room, the robot played a simplified version of tic-tac-toe with a patient.",
      "Samantha da Silva, speech language pathologist at the hospital, said patients light up when Robin comes into their room and not only remembers their names but their favorite music.",
      "\u201cShe brings joy to everyone,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cShe walks down the halls, everyone loves to chat with her, say hello.\u201d",
      "Robin mirrors the emotions of the person it is talking with, explained Khachikyan. If the patient is laughing then the robot laughs along, but if they're sharing something difficult, its face reflects sadness and empathy.",
      "In nursing homes, Robin plays memory games with people suffering from dementia, takes them through breathing exercises on difficult days and offers them a form of companionship that resembles a grandchild with a grandparent.",
      "Khachikyan recalled a moment last year at a facility in Los Angeles where a woman was having a panic attack and asked specifically for the robot. Robin played songs by her favorite musician and videos of her favorite animal \u2014 Elvis Presley and puppies \u2014 until she had calmed down.",

      "It would be the second call with Xi since Trump returned to the White House and launched sky-high tariffs on China, triggering back-and-forth trade restrictions that strained ties between the two largest economies.

      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Thursday didn\u2019t confirm the call or any upcoming summit between the leaders, but spokesperson Liu Pengyu said \u201cheads-of-state diplomacy plays an irreplaceable role in providing strategic guidance for China-U.S. relations.\u201d",

      "Trump, who has credited the app with helping him win another term, has extended a deadline several times for the app to be spun off from its Chinese parent company ByteDance.

      "The Trump administration recommended pregnant women limit Tylenol intake.",
      "During a press conference about Tylenol and autism risks, President Donald Trump repeated multiple inaccurate claims about a range of topics.",
      "On Monday, Trump, joined by top administration officials, claimed the use of Tylenol during pregnancy may be linked to an increased risk of autism and that pregnant women should limit their use, contradicting medical evidence.",
      "ABC News has evaluated some of the president's statements.",
      "CLAIM: Amish children do not get vaccines and do not get autism",
      "This is a common anti-vaccine talking point. Studies have identified and diagnosed autism in Amish children along with other conditions, according to the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR). Also, not all Amish families decline regular childhood vaccinations, according to a study done by Science Direct.",
      "While Autism rates indeed appear lower among Amish communities, experts say this is likely due to factors like limited healthcare access and cultural attitude leading to underreporting, not because these conditions are absent in these communities, experts say.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, the White House reiterated that \"rates of autism among Amish children is lower than that of non-Amish children.\"",
      "CLAIM: Kids get 80 vaccines, 'horse-sized' shots; some ingredients may not be safe",
      "It is not accurate that children get this many shots, nor is it accurate that children get an inappropriately large volume of vaccine.",
      "Children get roughly 30 vaccine doses before the age of 18, excluding flu and COVID, according to the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pediatric vaccine recommendations. In recent years, the number of additives and ingredients in vaccines has been decreasing, doctors have explained.",
      "The implication that children's immune systems get overwhelmed by vaccinations is not accurate, doctors say. Children's immune systems are exposed to many new bacteria and germs every day.",
      "The vaccine schedule is recommended based on dosing and protecting young children at certain times in their development of their lives. Certain vaccines need to be given multiple times to build up immunity; meanwhile, certain diseases are more dangerous to younger children. Other vaccines are timed to offer community protection before children go off to school.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, the White House said, \"The American childhood vaccine schedule calls for substantially more vaccinations than the vaccine schedules of comparable wealthy nations such as Denmark.\"",
      "CLAIM: Tylenol causes autism when taken during pregnancy, pregnant women should 'tough it out'",
      "No studies in people have shown that Tylenol (acetaminophen) directly causes autism. Some studies show a possible link, other studies show no such link, but all existing studies stop short of showing cause-and-effect.",

No new presentations on this topic were made at scientific or medical conferences. Instead, President Trump talked about what he thinks and feels without offering scientific evidence.\"",

      "CLAIM: Tylenol causes autism when given to young children",
      "No studies have shown any link between autism and giving Tylenol to young children, despite Trump's repeated assertion that young children should not receive Tylenol. One large analysis of multiple studies found no link between giving acetaminophen after birth and autism or ADHD in children.",
      "Steier said that at this point, there is no evidence of any causal link between acetaminophen use in kids and autism.",
      "\"Genetics plays the largest role in autism likelihood, followed by environmental factors during pregnancy, and parental age,\" she said. \"It is unlikely that factors after birth have a significant impact on autism likelihood.\"",
      "CLAIM: There is 'no reason' to vaccinate newborns against hepatitis B",
      "During Monday's presser, Trump suggested there should be major changes to the current recommendation of vaccinating all newborns against hepatitis B, explaining that it is a sexually transmitted disease.",

      "Hepatitis B can be transmitted sexually, but it can also be transmitted from mother-to-child during pregnancy, according to the World Health Organization. That is why current CDC guidance suggests infants are vaccinated in the hours after birth. If not vaccinated, a hepatitis B infection can lead to liver disease and liver cancer.",

      "World leaders will be listening closely to his remarks at the U.N.

Even in his first term, he was no fan of the flavor of multilateralism that the United Nations espouses.",
      "After his latest inauguration, he issued a first-day executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization. That was followed by his move to end U.S. participation in the U.N. Human Rights Council, and ordering up a review of U.S. membership in hundreds of intergovernmental organizations aimed at determining whether they align with the priorities of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.",

      "The U.S. president's speech is typically among the most anticipated moments of the annual assembly. This one comes at one of the most volatile moments in the world body\u2019s 80-year-old history. Global leaders are being tested by intractable wars in Gaza,Ukraine and Sudan, uncertainty about the economic and social impact of emerging artificial intelligence technology, and anxiety about Trump\u2019s antipathy for the global body.",
      "Trump has also raised new questions about the American use of military force in his return to the White House, after ordering U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June and a trio of strikes this month on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The latter strikes, including at least two fatal attacks on boats that originated from Venezuela, has raised speculation in Caracas that Trump is looking to set the stage for the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers and human rights advocates say that Trump is effectively carrying out extrajudicial killings by using U.S. forces to lethally target alleged drug smugglers instead of interdicting the suspected vessels, seizing any drugs and prosecuting the suspects in U.S. courts.",
      "\u201cThis is by far the most stressed the U.N. system has ever been in its 80 years,\u201d said Anjali K. Dayal, a professor of international politics at Fordham University in New York.",

      "\u201cThe president will also touch upon how globalist institutions have significantly decayed the world order, and he will articulate his straightforward and constructive vision for the world,\u201d Leavitt said.",

      "President Donald Trump has issued an executive order designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday signed an order designating a decentralized movement known as antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, though whether he can actually do that remained unclear. Trump blames antifa for political violence.",
      "The Republican president said on social media last week during a state visit to the United Kingdom that he would be making such a designation. He called antifa a \u201cSICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER\u201d and said he will be \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that its funders be investigated.",
      "The White House released Trump's executive order shortly after he departed for New York, where he was addressing the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.",
      "Here are a few things to know about Trump and antifa:",
      "Short for \u201canti-fascists,\u201d antifa is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.",
      "Antifa is a domestic entity and, as such, is not a candidate for inclusion on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terror organizations. Dozens of groups, including extremist organizations like the Islamic State and al-Qaida, are included on that list. The designation matters in part because it enables the Justice Department to prosecute those who give material support to entities on that list even if that support does not result in violence.",
      "But there is no domestic equivalent to that list in part because of broad First Amendment protections enjoyed by organizations operating within the United States. And despite periodic calls, particularly after mass shootings by white supremacists, to establish a domestic terrorism law, no singular statute now exists.",
      "The executive order did not specify how Trump he would go about designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.",
      "Literature from the antifa movement encourages followers to pursue lawful protest activity as well as more confrontational acts, according to a 2018 Congressional Research Service report.",
      "The literature suggests that followers monitor the activities of white supremacist groups, publicize online the personal information of perceived enemies, develop self-defense training regimens and compel outside organizations to cancel any speakers or events with \u201ca fascist bent,\u201d the report said.",
      "People associated with antifa have been present for significant demonstrations and counter-demonstrations in recent years, including mobilizing against a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. They were also present during clashes with far-right groups in Portland, Oregon.",

      "A state judge in Hartford approved the settlement on Thursday in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Grayson's husband. Meanwhile, settlement talks with other defendants in the lawsuit, including Grayson's employer, are continuing, said Kelly Reardon, a lawyer for Grayson's family.",
      "Grayson, a 63-year-old mother of six and a nurse for 36 years, had gone to the halfway house in Willimantic on Oct. 28, 2023, to administer medication to Michael Reese, who was living there while on probation and after serving prison time for stabbing and sexually assaulting another woman in 2006.",
      "Police found Grayson dead in the basement of the home later the same day. The medical examiner\u2019s office said she died of compression of the neck and had blunt force injuries. Reese pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced last month to 50 years in prison.",
      "The lawsuit alleged state officials failed to properly supervise Reese during his probation, failed to ensure the public was protected from him, failed to detain him when he violated his probation, failed to provide him adequate mental health and drug programs and allowed him to be alone with visiting nurses despite his violent past. The lawsuit blamed the Department of Correction and probation oversight run by the Judicial Branch.",
      "\u201cThe family hopes that this settlement demonstrates that the state is taking its involvement with the perpetrator of this horrific crime against Joyce Grayson seriously,\" Reardon said. \u201cAlong those lines, as part of the settlement, family members will be meeting with representatives of some of the involved state agencies to discuss ways that these types of crimes can be prevented in the future.\u201d",
      "The Connecticut attorney general's office, which represented the state in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment Tuesday. In the settlement agreement, the state does not admit to any wrongdoing.",

      "Florida has an estimated 4,000 black bears, wildlife officials say.",
      "Applications were taken from Sept. 12 through Monday. FWC spokeswoman Shannon Knowles said in an email Tuesday that the agency received 163,459 applications, adding that it does not have records of how many applications it got for the 2015 hunt, which resulted in more than 300 bears killed in two days.",

      "North Carolina Republican legislators have introduced criminal justice measures to toughen bail rules and evaluate offenders for mental health issues",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican legislators are poised this week to approve criminal justice measures designed to toughen bail rules, restrict magistrates' powers and evaluate offenders' mental health after the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train. The bill also could help get the death penalty carried out again in the ninth-largest U.S. state.",
      "Senate and House Republicans unveiled legislation that their leaders previously signaled would surface when the General Assembly reconvened on Monday after nearly two months away from Raleigh.",
      "The Aug. 22 death of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska \u2014 her attack caught on camera \u2014 and subsequent charges against a suspect who had previously been arrested more than a dozen times caused public outrage. An array of Republicans, President Donald Trump among them, have attempted to blame Zarutska's death on Charlotte-area leaders and Democratic state officials for what they call soft-on-crime policies.",
      "The Senate approved the legislation 28-8 late Monday, with many Democrats absent from the otherwise party-line vote. The bill now goes to the House, where a vote is likely Tuesday.",
      "Any final measure would then go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein\u2019s desk. Stein, the former attorney general, has suggested pretrial release changes and greater emphasis on mental health are needed in light of Zarutska's death.",
      "But the measure took a different direction \u2014 away from bipartisan support \u2014 when Senate Republicans approved an amendment that could in the future open the door to other forms of capital punishment beyond lethal injection, which is currently the state\u2019s sole method. North Carolina last carried out an execution in 2006.",
      "The stabbing suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., could received a death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in state court or a federal count filed against him.",
      "Brown, whose criminal record included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon, had been charged in January in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, with misusing the 911 system, a misdemeanor, according to court records.",
      "But a magistrate \u2014 a nonelected local court official who often determines if a defendant can be released while awaiting trial \u2014 released him on a written promise to return for court. And it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation for him. Brown\u2019s mother told Charlotte-area television that she had sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home.",
      "GOP Sen. Ralph Hise said the legislation has nothing to do with winning political points, but rather is a response to the failure of the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cWe need a criminal justice system that protects society from individuals. I believe these are many great steps in this bill,\u201d Hise said.",
      "The measure, named \u201cIryna\u2019s Law,\u201d would prohibit cashless bail for certain crimes and eliminate some of the discretion that magistrates and judges have for pretrial release decisions.",
      "For example, first-time defendants accused of a violent offense could only be released on a secured cash bond or receive house arrest with electronic monitoring. Such house arrest and monitoring would be the only option for some repeat defendants.",
      "The bill also attempts to ensure that more suspects are subject to psychological examinations before their potential release. Defendants accused of a violent crime and committed involuntarily in recent years to a mental health facility would be subject to a psychological evaluation.",

      "The secretary \u2014 a member of the governor's Cabinet \u2014 would have to select another method that's been adopted by another state and has not been found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. That could include the use of a firing squad, a method that's been used to execute South Carolina inmates twice this year.",
      "The measure already contained language that attempted to speed up death penalty appeals in North Carolina.",

      "Bourbon production at Buffalo Trace Distillery has been connected to the Kentucky River for decades",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- The long history of bourbon production at Buffalo Trace Distillery has been connected to the Kentucky River \u2014 summed up as a blessing and curse by a plaque on the grounds.",
      "In the 1800s, long before the Buffalo Trace name was attached to the distillery, the river served as a floating highway to bring in grain and other production essentials and to transport barrels of whiskey to markets along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Even today, river water cools down production equipment. But the river flowing past the distillery flashed its destructive side in April.",
      "A massive flood, caused by days of unrelenting rain, sent the Kentucky River surging over its banks, inundating most of the 200-plus-acre distillery grounds on its main campus in Frankfort. Nearly every phase of production was impacted, as were several warehouses where whiskey is aged.",
      "\u201cIt was just something that was hard to process, but we knew we couldn\u2019t take too much time to process it,\" said Tyler Adams, a distillery general manager. He said they had much to do to recover from the reservoir of murky water that swamped the bourbon-making campus.",
      "Five months later, production at the distillery is back to normal, including of some of the most sought-after bourbons. Its lineup includes the namesake flagship brand, Buffalo Trace, as well as Eagle Rare, W.L. Weller and Blanton's. Pappy Van Winkle bourbons are distilled and aged at Buffalo Trace while the Van Winkle family remains in control of the coveted brand.",
      "The distillery recently filled its 9 millionth barrel of bourbon since Prohibition, just two and a half years since filling the 8 millionth barrel. It has also introduced new whiskeys to its catalogue and is renovating a campus building into a cafe and events center.",
      "The cleanup enlisted hundreds of plant employees and contract workers. Buffalo Trace fans swamped the distillery with offers to pitch in, Adams said. The distillery politely declined and suggested they might assist area residents instead.",
      "Crews removed debris, sanitized equipment and pumped out what was left after floodwaters receded. Bourbon barrels swept into the parking lot caught some attention, Adams said. No chance for sneak samples, though \u2014 the barrels were empty.",
      "Few visible reminders remain of that mud-caked, debris-strewn mess.",
      "Some filled whiskey barrels touched by floodwaters were still being cleaned and tested, but the meticulous task of examining thousands of barrels was nearly complete, the distillery said. Quality control assessments found only small amounts of aging whiskey were impacted. High water marks are etched into some buildings and tour guides casually remind visitors of the epic event.",
      "Danny Kahn, a master distiller for Buffalo Trace's parent company, says he still experiences \"a little PTSD\u201d when recalling those frantic days. River flooding has been a sporadic part of the distillery's history \u2014 including big ones in 1937 and 1978, but in early April, the floodwaters surged to previously unseen heights. Buffalo Trace had also just completed a decade-long, $1.2 billion expansion to double distilling capacity.",
      "\u201cIt actually looked kind of calm, but I knew that it was not calm because we could see buildings were under 10 feet (3 meters) of water,\" Kahn said. \"It was really quite overwhelming.\u201d",
      "Activating their flood plans, workers shut down the distillery and did what they could to safeguard equipment. After that, all they could do was watch and wait. Distillery officials observed the devastation from higher ground and via drone footage.",
      "Once the river crested, it took a few days for the floodwaters to fully recede, but operations gradually sprung back to life. Finished whiskey shipped out the day after the rain stopped. Bottling soon resumed and a makeshift gift shop opened until the visitors' center was repaired. Tours eventually resumed. But bourbon production halted for about a month as the cost for cleanup and repairs surpassed $30 million.",

Initial data for the first half of 2025 showed a continued decline, it said. American whiskey exports dropped more than 13% through July of this year compared to the year-ago period, it said. The American whiskey category includes bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey.",

      "At Buffalo Trace, its future is entrenched alongside the Kentucky River, realizing that more floods could come in the years ahead. The distillery learned lessons to be even better prepared next time.",
      "\u201cThis area being a National Historic Landmark, being right on the river, there\u2019s only so much you can do to hold back that water,\" Adams said. \"Your best bet is to prepare for it, do what you can. But holding back that water? It\u2019s really inevitable it\u2019s going to make it into some spaces.\u201d",

      "GENERAL DEBATE: The centerpiece of the week, it gives each country's leader (or a designee) the mic for a state-of-the-world speech.

      "WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Kamala Harris said Monday evening that she regrets not expressing her concerns about then-President Joe Biden running for a second term when a majority of Americans felt he was too old for the job.",
      "\"I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on,\" Harris told Rachel Maddow on MSNBC in her first live television interview since the election.",
      "Such a conversation, even if it happened privately and behind the scenes, would have been an extraordinary breach in a relationship between a president and vice president.",
      "Harris' comments expand on a passage in her book, \u201c107 Days,\u201d that looks back on her experience replacing Biden as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee after he dropped out of the race. Harris ultimately lost to Republican candidate Donald Trump.",
      "In the book, Harris wrote that everyone in the White House would say \u201cit's Joe and Jill's decision\u201d about running for reelection, referring to the president and first lady.",
      "\u201cWas it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe stakes were simply too high. This wasn\u2019t a choice that should have been left to an individual\u2019s ego, an individual\u2019s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\u201d",
      "In her interview with Maddow, Harris said, \"when I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself.\u201d",
      "Harris said in the interview she was concerned that \u201cit would come off as completely self-serving\u201d if she had counseled Biden not to seek reelection. She had competed against him for their party's 2020 nomination, and she was well positioned to run again.",
      "A representative for Biden declined comment.",
      "Although Harris wrote that she wasn't worried about Biden's ability to continue doing the job, she had concerns about him campaigning.",
      "\u201cHis voice was no longer strong, his verbal stumbles more frequent,\u201d she wrote. Before Biden dropped out, there were plans for him to run a White House-centric campaign while Harris did more traveling. A week after Biden's disastrous debate against Trump, she wrote that \u201che felt so frail.\u201d",
      "Harris turns 61 next month, and she hasn't detailed her future plans. Asked about running for president again in 2028, Harris said \u201cthat's not my focus right now.\u201d She's already passed on an opportunity to run for governor of her home state of California.",

      "Kimmel gave a brief explanation for what took place behind the scenes between himself and ABC's brass.",
      "\"I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday,\" Kimmel said. \"I did not agree with that decision, and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company\u2026they welcomed be back on the air.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!\"",
      "He went on, \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,\" Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, \u2014 which the network settled in December by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million towards Mr. Trump's legal fees.",
      "\"This one sounds even more lucrative,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"A true bunch of losers!\"",
      "Kimmel told his audience Tuesday that the president \"made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.\"",
      "He went on: \"One thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like is anti-American.\"",
      "In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" Carr told Johnson. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "ABC later said that it was \"indefinitely\" suspending the show.",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to preempt Kimmel's show.",
      "Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",
      "Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"monitor the show as it returns to ABC.\"",
      "Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" calling his comments \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities \u2014 including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep \u2014 signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"",
      "Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform \"for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also speculated last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" the president told reporters on Sept. 18. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'\" Cruz said Friday on his podcast. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"",
      "Kimmel's show, which launched in 2003, tapes in front of a studio audience on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The guests for Tuesday's show included actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan.",

      "Findley pleaded guilty in February to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She also had been indicted on a charge of aggravated identity theft, but that charge was dropped as part of a plea agreement.",
      "Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Lisa Marie Presley borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan before her death in January 2023, prosecutors said when Findley was charged in August 2024. Findley  then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to prosecutors.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Riley Keough, Lisa Marie's daughter, sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "Graceland opened as a museum and tourist attraction in 1982 and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. A large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street from the museum is owned by Elvis Presley Enterprises. Presley died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Members of the Presley family, including Elvis, Lisa Marie and Benjamin Keough are buried on the property.",

      "After the scheme fell apart, Findley tried to make it look like the person responsible was a Nigerian identity thief, prosecutors said. An email sent May 25, 2024, to the AP from the same email as the earlier statement said in Spanish that the foreclosure sale attempt was made by a Nigerian fraud ring that targets old and dead people in the U.S. and uses the internet to steal money.",

      "The lawyers made their arguments in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who has already rejected a proposed $50 million bail package, signaling that he doesn't believe the Grammy-winning artist is close to being released.",
      "\"Mr. Combs's celebrity status in the realms of music, fashion, spirits, media, and finance has been shattered and Mr. Combs's legacy has been destroyed,\" the lawyers wrote, saying their client has been punished enough.",

      "Lawyers say Combs had no choice to face trial after plea offer",
      "Prior to trial, the lawyers said, prosecutors offered Combs a plea deal that would have recommended a prison sentence of at least 25 years and required him to plead guilty to crimes of which he was acquitted.",
      "They portrayed their client as a changed man, who had realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "\"Without minimizing Mr. Combs's conduct, this is in many ways a 'sex, drugs, and rock n' roll' story,\" they said. \"Mr. Combs had severe substance abuse problems throughout the entirety of the offense conduct and participated in a high-octane celebrity lifestyle.\"",

Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who led Disney for more than two decades, spoke out and defended Kimmel last week, writing on X: \"Where has all the leadership gone? If not for university presidents, law firm managing partners, and corporate chief executives standing up against bullies, who then will step up for the first amendment?\"",

    "published": "Sun, 21 Sep 2025 10:44:59 -0400",
    "summary": "The action movie star, who tapped into some childhood trauma to play mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr in his new film, reveals that he told costar Emily Blunt and director Benny Safdie he was scared to take on the dramatic role.",
    "story": [
      "This picturesque farm in rural Virginia is Dwayne Johnson's very private sanctuary, with a well-stocked pond that he usually fishes alone. \"Just me,\" he said, \"and I'll bring the girls here, and it's magical. Just the way the property is set up, I never have to see anybody. And I know it sounds crazy, and maybe kind of weird, but that's fun for me.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does that do for you?\"",
      "\"Peace,\" he replied.",
      "Peace has been hard to come by lately. Last month, Johnson made his first trip to the Venice Film Festival, for what is probably the most ambitious film of his career, \"The Smashing Machine.\" He plays the real-life mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr, a two-time world champion who fought drug addiction and depression.",
      "Johnson endured three hours of makeup and prosthetics a day to look like Kerr, and he's never played anyone quite so real before. But it's something he says he's been aching to do.",
      "\"For years, I've been dreaming and hoping,\" he said. \"My desire was to play not only a dramatic role, but something that I felt like I could really sink my teeth into, and rip myself open. You hear that term. I just didn't want to do drama. I wanted to do something that really allowed me to do that.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Smashing Machine\" click on the player below:",
      "I asked, \"This is a big, raw role. Did you have any doubts that you could do it?\"",
      "\"When it became real, yes,\" he said.",
      "Director Benny Safdie paired Johnson with Emily Blunt as Mark Kerr's volatile wife, Dawn Staples. The two last worked together in Disney's 2021 film \"Jungle Cruise,\" the kind of film on which Johnson built his multi-billion-dollar career.",
      "\"I was chasing something for a lot of years, and what I was chasing was box office,\" he said. \"And there's a part of me, the brain [that goes], 'Don't rock the boat. Stay in this zone. Everyone's happy. You're paying the bills.' But the heart is like, 'Yeah. But you're not being fulfilled.'\"",
      "\"Did you feel like that, you weren't being fulfilled?\" I asked.",
      "\"One hundred percent,\" Johnson said. \"But I was really nervous. And on day one, I remember Benny coming to me, and Emily as well, [they] said, 'Are you scared?' I went, 'Yes.'\"",
      "\"You flat out said, 'Yes, I'm scared'?\"",
      "\"Absolutely. I am.\"",
      "And Dwayne Johnson doesn't scare easily.",
      "His father was a professional wrestler, and with dad on the road a lot of the time, young Dwayne grew up with his share of trauma. When he was 15, Dwayne and his mom were evicted from their apartment because they couldn't pay the rent.",
      "He moved around a lot, and eventually started wrestling on local TV in Memphis, which he showed us in 2022.",
      "We also saw where he stayed back then: a dilapidated trailer in nearby Mississippi.",
      "The trailer park kid fought his way out of poverty, became the wrestling legend known as \"The Rock,\" and eventually moved into movies, from action (the \"Fast and the Furious\" series) to animation (\"Moana\").",
      "For \"The Smashing Machine,\" he had to find a way to transform into someone whose whole world was coming apart, like the scene where Mark Kerr loses his first fight. To conjure up the feelings of despair on camera, Johnson knew right where to go. \"I went back to what it's like being a 15-year-old kid and coming home and being evicted,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"You said it felt like you were ripping yourself open. What do you think that did for you, Dwayne Johnson, ripping yourself open like that?\"",
      "\"The thing that I was running from, which was ripping myself open, is actually the thing that I needed the most,\" he replied, \"because it made me realize that the thing I love, which is acting and telling these stories, now I see it in a different world.\"",
      "These days, Johnson talks a lot about gratitude. At his property in Virginia, far from the trailer in Mississippi, he said, \"Even more reason to be grateful.\"",
      "One thing he won't talk about: Oscar buzz. \"No, no, I can't, I can't,\" he said. \"The thought that that is even a question? \u00a0\u2026 \u00a0You know, trailer park kid.\"",
      "The married father of three will be starting work on another \"Moana\" film soon, and also another drama. Yes, Dwayne Johnson will always be The Rock, but as any scientist can tell you, rocks can change.",
      "This Rock, for one, seems smaller now. \"Yeah. Svelte!\" he laughed. \"Because I'm preparing for a role.\"",
      "\"So, this really is, this is like a new era for you?\"",
      "\"It's a new, I wouldn't say, chapter. I would say new book. A whole new book. And I love it.\"",

      "In Priscilla Beaulieu Presley's new memoir, \"Softly, as I Leave You: Life After Elvis\" (written with Mary Jane Ross, to be published Sept. 23 by Grand Central), she recounts what she lost when she divorced the King, and how she found herself \u2013 as a single mother, businesswoman and actress.",
      "In the excerpt below, Priscilla writes about the events of August 16, 1977, when Elvis was found dead at Graceland, and the effect upon her and their daughter, Lisa Marie.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "On August 16, 1977, I was meeting my sister for lunch on Melrose Avenue. It was a strangely cold and damp day for summer in Los Angeles. As I neared the restaurant, Michelle was flagging me down from the corner across the street. When I came to a stop, she rushed over to the car. She told me that she'd just had a call from Dad. Joe Esposito was phoning all over, trying to get a hold of me. It was something about Elvis being in the hospital. My heart stopped. I knew Joe wouldn't be doing that if it was just another of Elvis's hospital stays. Something must be terribly wrong.",
      "I did a U-turn and raced home, running traffic lights and going far too fast. Cars skidded to a halt to miss me. It's a miracle I didn't get hit. All the way home, I prayed over and over, \"Dear God, please let it be all right.\" Lisa was at Graceland, due to come home later that day, so she was part of whatever was happening.",
      "When I reached home, I could hear the phone ringing as I got out of the car. I prayed it would keep ringing until I reached it. I let myself into the house with shaking hands and grabbed the receiver.",
      "It was Joe. I said, \"What's happened?\" He replied, \"It's Elvis.\"",
      "\"Oh my God.\"",
      "\"Cilla, he's dead. We've lost him.\" His voice broke.",
      "I began screaming, \"No! No, no, no, no, no!\" I started to sob, and I could hear Joe crying on the other end of the line.",
      "\"Joe, where's Lisa?\"",
      "\"She's okay. She's with Grandma.\" I asked Joe to send a plane for me, as quickly as he could, and hung up. The questions I needed answered would have to wait.",
      "A few minutes later, the phone rang again, and when I picked it up, I heard Lisa's voice saying, \"Mommy! Mommy! Something's happened to Daddy! Everybody's crying.\"",
      "I could hear Vernon's voice in the background, sobbing and saying, \"My son! My son!\"",
      "I told Lisa, \"I know, baby,\" and reassured her that Daddy's plane was coming for me soon. I told her to wait with Grandma until I got there. She said she was going outside to play with her friend.",
      "I hung up in a kind of daze. I couldn't absorb what Joe had told me. How could Elvis be dead? I had just talked to him two days before. He'd sounded good.",
      "Joe sent Elvis's private plane, the Lisa Marie, to pick up Michelle and me, my parents, Jerry Schilling, and a handful of other close friends to fly us to Memphis. When we got to Graceland, I found Lisa playing golf carts in the yard with one of her friends. At first, I thought it was an odd reaction, and I worried about what the paparazzi would make of Lisa playing in the wake of her father's death. But then I realized it was a child's way of escaping the reality of the silent house. I hugged her close, then went inside.",
      "I still didn't know what had happened, so Joe told me. Ginger had found Elvis unconscious, face down on the floor of the bathroom, that afternoon. She called downstairs for help, and Joe had raced upstairs. He knew immediately that Elvis had passed, but he didn't want to believe it. My heart plummeted as Joe confirmed that Lisa had seen Elvis's body. Elvis was still face down on the floor when she saw him, his face buried in the shag carpet. Lisa had been afraid he was suffocating. Joe wasn't sure if she'd understood what she was seeing. He'd sent her to see Grandma while the ambulance came. He did chest compressions while they waited for the ambulance. A doctor continued efforts to resuscitate Elvis as they raced to the hospital, but all the efforts were futile. Shortly after arrival, Elvis was pronounced dead. Apparently, it was a heart attack.",
      "Inside Graceland, the atmosphere was eerie. The house seemed hollow and dead. It was as if the energy had been sucked out of it\u2014Elvis's life force. We all walked around like zombies. Vernon was distraught. He felt Elvis's passing very, very deeply. It broke my heart to see such a strong man repeatedly call out his son's name, tears streaming down his face. He was losing his only child. A part of Vernon was lost that day as well. I never again saw the energy he once had. When- ever he'd come into a room and said, \"Hey, son,\" his face would light up with a smile. I never saw that smile again. Grandma struggled to believe that Elvis was gone. After he left us, she always carried a little handkerchief. I'd see her tearing up, and she'd wipe her eyes and whisper, \"My boy.\"",
      "There was no privacy for those of us closest to Elvis, including the family. People and cameras surrounded the property. Mourners waited to be admitted to the house for a public viewing of Elvis's open casket. The funeral was a nationally televised event. The streets near Graceland were thronged with tens of thousands of people. The crowds were so large by the second day that President Jimmy Carter called up the Air National Guard to help local police. It was hot and muggy, and some in the crowd fainted from the heat and from emotion. In the afternoon, thousands of people filed past the open casket that had been set up in the front hall. Lisa stayed with Elvis's body as much as she could. She didn't want to leave him. We sat on the stairs and watched as people walked by. Crowds of strangers in Elvis's home, crying and paying their respects. Some mourners had walked away from their jobs to drive sixteen hours or more to Memphis and line up along Elvis Presley Boulevard, hoping to be admitted to the house. The trip was a financial sacrifice for many of them, for much of the crowd was made up of the everyday people who identified with Elvis as one of their own. He, too, had come from poverty. He had remained loyal to his hometown and his family, and he never got above his upbringing. They felt compelled to pay their respects as they would to a family member. It was overwhelming. There wasn't room yet for our own grief.",
      "His memorial was an international event. While mourners gathered in Memphis, Christ's Church in London held a service in Elvis's honor. Over five hundred people crowded the sanctuary and the lawn outside. At the close of the service, they all sang \"Amazing Grace\" in his honor. Elvis's passing was felt not just in Memphis, but around the world.",
      "The private funeral service was held in the living room and adjoining music room, with the peacock glass framing an archway between the two. Elvis's coffin was moved into the room for the service. Vernon had hired a local preacher who didn't know Elvis and who talked primarily about Elvis's legendary generosity. The Blackwood Brothers, longtime friends and backup singers for Elvis, sang gospel songs. I sat on the couch with Lisa and Vernon, numb with grief. It was all a blur at the time, and it still is.",
      "Lisa and I waited until we could be alone with Elvis to say goodbye. I had bought a silver bracelet engraved with the words, \"I love you, Daddy,\" for Lisa to give him. I helped her put it around his wrist. Then we each kissed him one last time. I'm not sure it hit me until then that he was really gone. The body I had held and caressed so many times was now stiff and empty. It was an eerie, aching feeling.",
      "A line of white Cadillacs formed the funeral procession to the Forest Hill Cemetery. Lisa and I rode with Vernon in the car immediately following the hearse. Elvis was entombed in the Presley family crypt with his mother. Two days later, after two thieves tried to steal the coffin, he was moved to the Meditation Garden at Graceland and kept under security. Gladys was moved to Graceland shortly afterward, to lie beside him. Elvis and I used to sit in that garden in the small hours of the morning, in the peace and the moonlight. I was glad they had brought him home.",
      "Vernon had a bronze plaque made to cover the coffin, with an inscription ending, \"We miss you, Son and Daddy.\"",
      "I returned home to LA with Lisa, feeling that a large part of me had died with Elvis. I couldn't accept that he had passed. I'd felt Elvis would always be there. He was such a force of nature. Despite all my fears for him, I never thought he would die at the age he did. He was still so young. He'd talked so much about what he still wanted to do. He had plans for his music and for his life. Elvis wasn't ready to leave. I wasn't ready.",
      "It was a constant battle to accept that he was gone. Every morning, I would wake up and remember, \"Oh God, Elvis isn't here anymore. How can I live knowing that?\" I was frightened to be in a world without Elvis in it.",
      "There would be no more calls. I would never again pick up the phone and hear his voice. There would be no more visits, no more dropping by unexpectedly. I wouldn't be going to Graceland anymore, except to visit Grandma and Vernon. There was no more Memphis Mafia. Everybody scattered. Everything changed. I changed. I had been happy-go-lucky, always excited about where we were going or what we were doing next. I had finally adjusted to the separation, feeling free and adventurous. Optimistic. My memories of Elvis had been happy ones. When I went somewhere we'd been, I would think, \"Oh my gosh, we went here.\" I remembered the times fans would cling to him and want pictures. They loved him and didn't want to let him go, and when he tried to escape, a trail of girls would follow him. It had been fun. He had so much charm and was so generous to loved ones and strangers alike. It filled him with joy when he was able to do something special for other people.",
      "Now my mind was filled with images of loss. I couldn't get away from reminders of him. The media was filled with articles and broadcasts about Elvis, and his songs flooded the radio stations. If I went out, people would come over and say, \"I'm so sorry.\" I knew they meant well, but it was painful. For a long time after Elvis passed, I rarely went anywhere. I waited a while to continue with my life.",
      "Worst of all, I no longer had a father for my daughter. I was raising my child by myself, a brokenhearted child who had lost her daddy. When we got back home from the funeral, we were surrounded by reminders of his passing. I had to protect her from all the news reports, the unwanted attention, the nonstop condolence calls. It seemed like every newspaper and magazine had a headline about his passing. If Lisa and I went to the grocery store, I'd pull the ones with headlines out of the rack and turn them around in the checkout line so Lisa wouldn't see them. To get her away from the constant reminders, I decided to send her to summer camp. I hoped it would not only insulate her from the publicity but also take her mind off her thoughts. Joanie's kids and some of her other friends were there. I checked on her regularly at camp, and she seemed to be doing pretty well. She later said that camp had helped. When it ended for the summer, my sister and I took her out of the country to give her some privacy until the incessant publicity died down. We went to England and later to Europe. We were seldom recognized there, and we could explore the sights in peace.",

    "summary": "In her new book, Priscilla Presley writes what she calls her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after.",
    "story": [
      "It was a truly Vegas affair at the Aladdin Hotel; Elvis in a paisley tux, Priscilla with a rhinestone tiara. By the time they'd met, when Priscilla Beaulieu was just 14, Elvis Presley had already gyrated his way into pop culture, from his music to his movies.",
      "He redefined what celebrity was, and yet, Hollywood was no place for him. \"He would always go back to Memphis; that's where home was,\" said Priscilla.",
      "Priscilla met Elvis while he was in the Army stationed in Germany. The only thing that made more news than their relationship was their divorce in 1973. \"I mean, I was very much in love with Elvis, very much,\" said Priscilla, now 80. \"I am still very much in love with him. I didn't leave him because I didn't love him; I just couldn't live the life.\"",
      "Her split from Elvis is where she begins \"Softly, as I Leave You\" (to be published Tuesday), what she says is her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after. \"I was living Elvis' life,\" she said. \"It was all about him. I had to find me. Who was I? I was Elvis' wife. I don't think we could ever have a life that I wanted. I wanted him for myself.\"",
      "But so did his fans. Elvis, it seemed was destined to be shared. \"I thought, well, what if he runs into someone he falls in love with?\" said Priscilla. \"And I mentioned it to him, and he goes, 'You don't have to worry. You never have to worry.' But when you see these beautiful girls hanging out, I'm going,\u00a0Could that be the one?",
      "\"I couldn't live a life of being in panic all the time, of losing him to someone else,\" she said.",
      "There were affairs on both sides, and yet after their divorce, they still couldn't quit each other. They stayed uncommonly close. Neither ever remarried. \"We couldn't find anyone else!\" she laughed.",
      "She started businesses, and began taking acting classes. She says it helped with her shyness, and grew her confidence. She was also busy raising her and Elvis' only daughter, Lisa Marie. They had joint custody for nearly four years \u2026 before it all ended.",
      "At age 42, Elvis was gone.",
      "Priscilla had seen the changes \u2013 the bloating, the slurred words, the drugs.",
      "I asked, \"Was there anybody around him who could convince him to stop?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"You couldn't convince Elvis on anything unless he believed in it or, you know, thought about it.\"",
      "She said doctors would basically give him anything he wanted, enabling him. \"He was Elvis; you're not going to say no to Elvis,\" she said.",
      "In his absence sat Graceland, the Memphis mansion that had been hemorrhaging money. The urge was to sell. Priscilla said, \"And I looked at the guy who was telling me, the attorney, and I said, 'That will never happen, ever.'\"",
      "Instead, she opened it to the public. It went from a home to a family shrine.",
      "By the time Lisa Marie turned 25, Elvis' inheritance was hers. It was 1993, the same year another King popped the question \u2026 the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.",
      "Priscilla recalled, \"We were walking on the beach, and she said, 'Mom, you know, Michael wants to get married.' I said, 'Lisa, I'm not really for it.' And she goes, 'Why not.' And I go, 'Who are you? Michael Jackson, Lisa Presley?' And I knew that Michael loved attention, which he did. I knew that's the reason why. They didn't even know each other that long.\"",
      "Priscilla was no fan of another celebrity, O.J. Simpson. She worked with him on the \"Naked Gun\" series. \"He could be very, very nice, but I just didn't, I just felt something about him in the way he was with his wife, and it didn't set well with me,\" she said.",
      "That said, Priscilla was a huge fan of co-star Leslie Nielsen.",
      "Before \"Naked Gun,\" Priscilla had never done comedy. She was thought of in most circles as a more serious actor after her role in \"Dallas\" a few years before.",
      "\"Dallas\" was a spotlight the size of Texas, and Priscilla's role as Jenna Wade put her in the pop zeitgeist all over again.",
      "She left the series after having her second child, Navarone, with her longtime partner Marco Garibaldi.",
      "In 2023, her last physical link with Elvis left. Lisa Marie Presley died suddenly at her home in California from complications after bariatric surgery, and once again the Presley name was draped in grief.",
      "\"I miss her every day,\" Priscilla said. \"I miss her, but I have to let that go and live my life. But her spirit is still with me very, very much.\"",
      "She's buried at Graceland, like her dad. Priscilla says she will be there one day, too. For her, the first home she had as a married woman will be her last.\u00a0 That's not looking backward, she says; it's a comfort for the future.",
      "\"When you stop and think about it, we're not here that long. We're not,\" Priscilla said. \"All of a sudden we're older and we think, Wow, I don't want to hold on to bad things. I don't want to hold on to, you know, things that are in the past that happened. I want to move forward.\"",

      "There was a warm glow in the mountains above Sundance this past week: Hundreds standing in line for a chairlift vigil to honor a man whose legacy is as solid as the mountain itself.",
      "Robert Redford spent most of his life up in the Utah mountains. It's where \"Sunday Morning\" first met him back in 1994.",
      "There was a gentleness between him and our Charles Kuralt; the outdoors meant the world to both of them.",

Boo! You tell him lover! And make fun of the scene,\" Redford said. \"Suddenly, the idea that I would be that guy was just too much for me to take.\"",
      "He wasn't always the heartthrob, of course, especially in his later works. In \"All Is Lost,\" it was all him. For an hour and forty-five minutes, he rarely even spoke, but we watched, because it was Redford.",
      "He was 77 when he shot that. He was 81 when he did \"The Old Man and the Gun.\" It was that film, he told us, that would likely be his last. As hard as it was for us to hear him say that, Redford replied, \"It's hard for me to say it! Well, yeah, it's hard to talk about your end. I mean, who does?\"",
      "Among his more than 80 films, many have become classics. He defined what a leading man was.",

    "summary": "His music dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, as an early bandmate of Buddy Holly, and the writer of such classic songs as \"I Fought the Law.\" But Sonny Curtis' most memorable composition may be a TV theme song that turned the world on with a smile.",
    "story": [
      "The theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is familiar to generations of TV watchers. The name of the man who wrote and sang it, less so.",
      "Who can turn the world on with her smile?Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?Well, it's you, girl, and you should know itWith each glance and every little movement you show it",
      "Love is all around, no need to waste itYou can have the town, why don't you take itYou're gonna make it after all",
      "But by the time Sonny Curtis recorded \"Love Is All Around\" in 1970, he'd \"made it\" several times over himself, as a songwriter, as a recording artist, and as an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly.",
      "Born in 1937 in rural West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told correspondent Mo Rocca. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\"",
      "His love of music came from family. His aunt taught him to play the guitar, and while working those fields, Curtis dreamed up his own songs: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"",
      "Curtis was just 14 when he met a young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock. \"Buddy had black hair, but he had dyed it blonde, and it was growing out. And he reminded me of a black-and-tan coon hound. We sorta skipped all the niceties and got our guitars and started playing.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"How quickly did you realize this guy's serious about music?\"",
      "\"Buddy, he exuded confidence. He just knew he was gonna make it big one day.\"",
      "The two became fast friends, bonded by their love of music. Sometimes, Curtis said, he'd spend the night at Buddy's. The two would wake up at midnight and flip on the car radio for a show out of Shreveport, Louisiana, to hear some of the rhythm and blues voices that would shape rock 'n' roll: \"We heard, oh, Big Mama Thornton and Lonnie Johnson, and Lead Belly, Little Richard, Ray Charles, you name it.\"",
      "\"Were you just absorbing this?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"Oh, boy, were we ever, yeah!\"",
      "Buddy and Sonny had formed a band and were still figuring out their own sound, when a then little-known Elvis Presley came to town. \"And I mean, the girls were goin' nuts, man. And that really got our attention. All a sudden, we thought, this not only involves music, this involves pretty girls!\"",
      "When Elvis came back to town in 1956, Buddy and Sonny's band was the opening act. \"Well, I guess we were right there sort of at the beginning of rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "\"What was Elvis like backstage?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"He was just an old boy.\"",
      "The band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money.",
      "So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman. \"He treated me kind of like a little brother,\" Curtis said. \"I remember I'd be on the stage and he'd come over and say, 'Now don't be nervous.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Buddy Holly formed a new band, which would prove to be seminal. The Crickets shot to fame, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"When that was happening, did you feel a little left out, like, 'Ugh'?\"",
      "\"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis replied.",
      "But on February 3, 1959, Curtis' friend and former bandmate died in a plane crash near Clear Lake Iowa.",
      "Curtis served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Buddy Holly was 22 when he died,\" Rocca said.",
      "\"Yes. Can you imagine the amount of music he pumped into the system in a short period of, like, 18 months? No telling how much he would've contributed had he been around.\"",
      "By that time, Curtis had joined the Crickets. But with Holly gone, the band felt rudderless.",
      "It was Curtis' talent for songwriting that helped put the wind back in his sails. His song \"Walk Right Back'' became a big hit for the Everly Brothers:",
      "And then there's this classic, which Curtis claims he wrote in about 20 minutes: \"I Fought the Law\":",
      "\"I Fought the Law\" has been covered by artists from The Bobby Fuller Four to The Clash.",
      "Sonny Curtis is 84 now. He and Louise, his wife of more than 50 years, live outside Nashville, where they raised their daughter, Sarah. He is enshrined in Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame \u2013 as is his old guitar.",
      "In 2012, the year the Crickets retired, they were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "But it's a song Curtis wrote for the small screen that may be his most enduring legacy.",
      "In 1970, he was living in Los Angeles when he got a call from a friend about a new sitcom being produced for Mary Tyler Moore: \"It was just this young girl gets jilted in this small community, and she moves to the big city of Minneapolis, gets a job at a news station. And that was about it.\"",
      "Curtis wrote the theme song based on a four-page description of the show. \"I honed in on the part that she rented an apartment she had a hard time affording, and wrote, 'How will you make it on your own?' \u2026 'This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone.'\"",
      "Within just a few hours, Curtis was summoned to the studio to play his song for producer James L. Brooks. Curtis recalled, \"I got my guitar out and I sang it to him. He smiled and said, 'Sing that again.' And I had to sing it about ten times. And before I left that afternoon, the room was full of people standing all around the walls. I thought, 'I believe I got a shot at this!'\"",
      "WEB EXTRA: Sonny Curtis on writing the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" theme song",
      "Rocca said, \"It wasn't a given that you'd write and sing it.\"",
      "\"No. As a matter of fact they didn't want me to sing it. I said, 'I wanna sing this,' you know? And I was probably more pushy than I should have been, if I'da known better. But fortunately, I didn't know better at the time!\"",
      "When the show became a hit, Curtis was asked to rework his song: \"When they started to do the second season, he said, 'Sonny, she's obviously made it. And we have to have some new lyrics.'\"",
      "For a man whose career dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, Sonny Curtis remains disarmingly humble. \"Oh, I've always sort of had a rule, don't give advice in a crowd,\" he laughed.",
      "But when pressed, he will share some wisdom: \"If they say, 'Man, you oughta go back to Texas 'cause you'll never make it,' just look at them and say, 'No, you're wrong, because I am gonna make it.'\"",
      "Rocca replied, \"You know, I should write this down, 'cause this sounds like a song right here!\"",

    "summary": "Sonny Curtis died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press.",
    "story": [
      "Sonny Curtis, a vintage rock 'n' roller who wrote the raw classic \"I Fought the Law\" and posed the enduring question \"Who can turn the world on with her smile?\" as the writer-crooner of the theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" has died at 88.",
      "Curtis, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Crickets in 2012, died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press. A statement from his family on his Facebook page Saturday said that he had become suddenly ill.",
      "\"He made a mark on this world, and he made a mark on the hearts of all who knew him. It's a sad day, but what a life. May we look at his life with joy rather than sadness. He would have wanted that,\" the statement read.",
      "The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum also acknowledged Curtis' death.",
      "\"Sonny Curtis was a gentle, humble man who wrote extraordinary songs,\" said Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, in a statement.",
      "Curtis wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs, from Keith Whitley's country smash \"I'm No Stranger to the Rain\" to the Everly Brothers' \"Walk Right Back,\" a personal favorite Curtis completed while in Army basic training. Bing Crosby, Glen Campbell, Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead were among other artists who covered his work.",
      "Curtis' start with Buddy Holly",
      "Born during the Great Depression to cotton farmers outside of Meadow, Texas, Curtis was a childhood friend of Buddy Holly's and an active musician in the formative years of rock, whether jamming on guitar with Holly in the mid-1950s or opening for Elvis Presley when Elvis was still a regional act. Curtis' songwriting touch also soon emerged: Before he turned 20, he had written the hit \"Someday\" for Webb Pierce and \"Rock Around With Ollie Vee\" for Holly.",
      "Curtis had left Holly's group, the Crickets, before Holly became a major star. But he returned after Holly died in a plane crash in 1959 and he was featured the following year on the album \"In Style with the Crickets,\" which included \"I Fought the Law\" (dashed off in a single afternoon, according to Curtis, who would say he had no direct inspiration for the song) and the Jerry Allison collaboration \"More Than I Can Say,\" a hit for Bobby Vee, and later for Leo Sayer.",
      "Meanwhile, it took until 1966 for \"I Fought the Law\" and its now-immortal refrain \"I fought the law \u2014 and the law won\" to catch on: The Texas-based Bobby Fuller Four made it a Top 10 song. Over the following decades, it was covered by dozens of artists, from punk (the Clash) to country (Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith) to Springsteen, Tom Petty and other mainstream rock stars.",
      "\"It's my most important copyright,\" Curtis told The Tennessean in 2014.",
      "\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\"",
      "Curtis' other signature song was as uplifting as \"I Fought the Law\" was resigned. In 1970, he was writing commercial jingles when he came up with the theme for a new CBS sitcom starring Moore as a single woman hired as a TV producer in Minneapolis. He called the song \"Love is All Around,\" and used a smooth melody to eventually serve up lyrics as indelible as any in television history:",
      "\"Who can turn the world on with her smile? / Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? / Well it's you girl, and you should know it / With each glance and every little movement you show it.\"",
      "The song's endurance was sealed by the images it was heard over, especially Moore's triumphant toss of her hat as Curtis proclaims, \"You're going to make it after all.\" In tribute, other artists began recording it, including Sammy Davis Jr., Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Minnesota's H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. A commercial release featuring Curtis came out in 1980 and was a modest success, peaking at No. 29 on Billboard's country chart.",
      "Curtis would recall being commissioned by his friend Doug Gilmore, a music industry road manager who had heard the sitcom's developers were looking for an opening song.",
      "\"Naturally I said yes, and later that morning, he dropped off a four-page format \u2014 you know 'Girl from the Midwest, moves to Minneapolis, gets a job in a newsroom, can't afford her apartment etc.,' which gave me the flavor of what it was all about,\" said Curtis, who soon met with show co-creator (and later Oscar-winning filmmaker) James L. Brooks.",
      "\"James L. Brooks came into this huge empty room, no furniture apart from a phone lying on the floor, and at first, I thought he was rather cold and sort of distant, and he said 'We're not at the stage of picking a song yet, but I'll listen anyway,'\" Curtis recalled. \"So I played the song, just me and my guitar, and next thing, he started phoning people, and the room filled up, and then he sent out for a tape recorder.\"",
      "Curtis would eventually write two versions: the first used in Season 1, the second and better known for the remaining six seasons. The original words were more tentative, opening with \"How will you make it on your own?\" and ending with \"You might just make it after all.\" By Season 2, the show was a hit and the lyrics were reworked. The producers had wanted Andy Williams to sing the theme song, but he turned it down and Curtis' easygoing baritone was heard instead.",
      "Solo career",
      "Curtis made a handful of solo albums, including \"Sonny Curtis\" and \"Spectrum,\" and hit the country Top 20 with the 1981 single \"Good Ol' Girls.\" In later years, he continued to play with Allison and other members of the Crickets. The band released several albums, among them \"The Crickets and Their Buddies,\" featuring appearances by Eric Clapton, Graham Nash and Phil Everly. One of Curtis' more notable songs was \"The Real Buddy Holly Story,\" a rebuke to the 1978 biopic \"The Buddy Holly Story,\" which starred Gary Busey.",
      "Curtis settled in Nashville in the mid-1970s and lived there with his wife, Louise. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1991 and, as part of the Crickets, into Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. Five years later, he and the Crickets were inducted into the Rock Hall, praised as \"the blueprint for rock and roll bands (that) inspired thousands of kids to start up garage bands around the world.\"",

      "Stephen Colbert, whose show was canceled by CBS two months ago,\u00a0called Kimmel's suspension \"blatant censorship.\"",

      "Kimmel's show was \"preempted indefinitely\" by ABC on Wednesday following comments he made about the reaction to Kirk's killing on Monday and Tuesday nights.

Sinclair Broadcast Group, another major station owner, also said it was pulling the show.",

      "California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington on Wednesday issued unified recommendations on COVID-19, influenza and RSV vaccines that differ from those issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Governors of the states, which make up the newly-formed West Coast Health Alliance, said in a joint press statement that their alliance was \"fighting back against the Trump administration's assault on science.\" Earlier this month, the states announced the formation of the alliance as a response to what it called the \"weaponization\" of the CDC, spearheaded by Health Secretary and vocal vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Kennedy's moves included firing all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine recommendations committee\u00a0and\u00a0replacing them with apointees that include vaccine skeptics, and\u00a0rolling back recommendations on who should receive COVID vaccines.",
      "\"Public health leaders warn these moves dismantle independent, science-based oversight and inject politics into decisions that protect Americans' health \u2014 undermining the CDC's credibility at a moment when trust and clarity are most needed,\" the alliance said Wednesday.",
      "The West Coast Health Alliance's recommendations for respiratory viruses say the COVID vaccine should be given to \"all who choose protection,\" and specifically children 6 months to 23 months old, all adults over 65, those younger than 65 with risk factors, and anyone pregnant or planning to get pregnant.",
      "The recommendations largely mirror what the CDC previously advised until this year, when Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID vaccine for children and pregnant women.",
      "U.S. Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon criticized the alliance's recommendations in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "\"Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people's trust in public health agencies,\" Nixon said. \"HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.\"",
      "The alliance also recommended that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, and that all babies, people 50-74 years old with risk factors, and everyone 75 and\tolder receive the RSV vaccine.",
      "Separately, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he had signed a new law, AB 144, which allows the state to base future immunization guidance on independent medical organizations rather than the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The law is designed to address which vaccines health insurance companies will cover, since insurers typically cover only those vaccines recommended by ACIP.",
      "Wednesday's announcement by the Western states comes on the same day former CDC chief Susan Monarez\u00a0told a Senate committee that she was fired by Kennedy for refusing to pre-approve childhood vaccine guidance regardless of the scientific data and refusing to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy, without cause.",
      "Other states, including Colorado, Illinois,\u00a0Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania have issued COVID vaccine guidelines that differ from the CDC. Meanwhile, Florida this month announced it would be the first state to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates.",

      "Introduced in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act signed, the federal tax credits \u2014 $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used \u2014 are being phased out due to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is also\u00a0ending a series\u00a0\u00a0of other clean energy credits over the next several months.",
      "With just one week to go until the expiration date of the Biden-era EV credit, customers are flocking to dealerships to cash in. EV sales reached a record high in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% year over year and used EV sales up 59% for the same period, data from Cox Automotive shows.",
      "\"As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,\" Cox Automotive said in its report.",
      "The findings jibe with data from Cars Commerce \u2014 whose holdings include\u00a0Cars.com\u00a0\u2014 that shows\u00a0 a 33% surge in EV demand since last year as shoppers rush to take advantage of the credits. The automotive tech company also found that used EVs are on dealers' lots for 46 days on average, a nearly 30% decrease from last last year that indicates the sector of the EV market is rising in popularity.",
      "Deals to be had",
      "Anxious to clear out EV inventory before the arrival of new models in November, dealerships have been offering their own incentives, such as monthly lease rates that are are as little as 1% of the car's sticker price.",

      "September 2025 could end up being the \"single biggest EV month in history,\" Tim Horvick, owner of the San Tan Ford dealership outside of Phoenix, told CBS' Van Cleave. But come October, when the EV credit is no longer in effect, the sales landscape could shift.",
      "\"It is the concern,\" Horvick said. \"It could be challenging.\"",
      "As a result of the coming end of the tax credit, along with other\u00a0policy changes introduced by the Trump administration, automakers have already slowed their production of electric vehicles, shifting their attention to more popular gas and hybrid models, CBS News reported.",
      "But not all experts believe the expiration of the tax credit will have a huge effect on future EV sales, and that's simply because sales were low to begin with.",
      "EV sales \"can't fall off a cliff because they're not very high,\" Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy, told CBS News' Van Cleave. \"They're gonna fall off a small hill because that's as high as they got.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans will dish out more money to heat their homes this winter as electricity and natural gas costs continue to soar.",
      "That's according to a new study from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) which predicts that\u00a0Americans will see their energy bill rise 7.6% to $976 on average this cold weather season. Those who rely on natural gas to heat their home could see an 8.4% jump in their bill, while those who use electricity could see a 10.2% increase.",
      "While electricity\u00a0prices vary\u00a0by state, overall the cost is rising. In August, prices increased by 6.2% compared with the same month last year, according to the latest inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Those costs will continue to escalate as much as 18% in the next few years, according to a May\u00a0report\u00a0from The U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Natural gas prices are up 13.8% from last year, far outpacing the rate of inflation, which rose 2.9% in August on an annual basis.",
      "Not all Americans will see an increase in their winter energy bills. Heating oil and propane users \u2014 roughly only 10% of U.S. households \u2014 could see their energy bills decrease by 4% and 5% respectively.",
      "The overall rising home-heating costs follow greater summer air-conditioning use, amid warmer temperatures. \"The average summer household electricity bill reached an estimated $776 in 2025, the highest in at least 12 years compounding household strain,\" the report states.",
      "\"We had a period of relatively stable electric bills and then last year electricity went up twice the rate of inflation,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As a result, more American households are falling behind on their energy bills.",
      "Since Dec. 31, 2023, energy arrearages \u2014 unpaid energy bills that homeowners owe to their utility company \u2014 have risen by about 31%, from approximately $17.5 billion to $23.0 billion by June 30, 2025, NEADA said in its report.",
      "The surge in energy arrearages comes as Americans are carrying\u00a0record amounts of debt. With inflation continuing to ramp up the cost of daily living, ahead of wages, total household debt reached $18.39 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with unpaid credit card balances exceeding $1.21 trillion.",
      "Why are energy prices rising?",
      "The main factors driving up energy prices is the ongoing high cost of maintaining and upgrading the grid, along with rising natural gas prices and increasing electricity demand from data centers according to the NEADA report.",
      "\"As demand goes up and supply is not matching that, prices are going to go up,\" Abe Scarr, director of the Energy and Utilities Program at the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), told CBS MoneyWatch",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine also\u00a0created volatility\u00a0in energy prices, government data shows.",
      "So far this year, approximately 60 utility companies have either increased electricity and gas prices or proposed further increases,\u00a0according to the Center for American Progress, a Washington D.C.-based think tank.

      "How to lower your utility bills",
      "As winter approaches, what can Americans do to lower their utility bill?",
      "Scarr suggests that people check with their utility companies, which often offer incentive programs to help customers implement cost-saving measures. Offerings vary by utility, but many companies provide free home energy assessments and discounts for people who want to insulate their homes.",
      "For those interested in fortifying the envelope of their home to minimize heat loss, options include hiring a contractor for a professional retrofit or, for straightforward insulation projects, DIY tips, he said.",
      "When it comes to general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. While it might seem obvious, people can also turn down the temperature in the home a few degrees to save money, said Scarr.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-h1b-visa-faq-100000-fee-uscis/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:09:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Heavy new H-1B visa fee raises numerous questions, immigration law experts told CBS News. Here's what employees and employers should know.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is sowing confusion among some immigrant workers and their employers, including whether it's safe for current holders of the visa to travel outside the U.S.",
      "The new fee, which President Trump announced in a proclamation on Friday, represents a major change to a 35-year-old program that has enabled millions of immigrants to work legally in the U.S. The visa has become a mainstay in the technology industry, including among bellwethers such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and is also widely used in the financial sector.",
      "Over the weekend, the White House sought to\u00a0clarify\u00a0the new policy, stating that the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and that it is a one-time cost required only when initially applying for the visa.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the addition of a $100,000 charge for H-1B visas on top of the existing fees reflects President Trump's promise \"to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "She added, \"The text of the proclamation is very clear, and it is unfortunate that uninformed reporters and corporate lawyers attempt to sow chaos and confusion. Americans have another reason to celebrate unprecedented action by President Trump to protect Americans from cheap foreign labor.\"",
      "After the White House outlined the new policy on Friday, some tech companies including Google and Microsoft this weekend instructed H-1B employees who were traveling outside the U.S. to return immediately, expressing concern they might not be allowed to re-enter without the $100,000 payment, according to workers and immigration lawyers.",
      "Despite the White House's clarification that the new fee applies only to new visa applications, not existing H-1B holders, there remains \"a great degree of uncertainty on the ground,\" Parul Koul, president of the union that represents employees at Google owner Alphabet, said during a press conference on Monday to address the new policy.",
      "On Tuesday, the Trump administration published a proposal to change how H-1B visas are allotted, switching from a randomized lottery to a system that would favor immigrants with higher skills and incomes.",
      "CBS News spoke with attorneys and other sources about the new policy \u2014 here's what to know.",
      "Who pays the $100,000 fee?",
      "Under current H-1B rules, employers pay the application fees on behalf of workers. Assuming that approach continues, that could deter many employers from picking up the additional $100,000 fees \u2014 roughly 10 times what they previously paid for an applicant, Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney and managing partner at Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Very few employers would be willing to shell out that kind of money,\" she said.",
      "Such an outcome would appear to align with the White House's goals of spurring employers to hire within the U.S. rather than recruiting foreign workers.",
      "\"It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",
      "When does the fee go into effect?",
      "The new fee must be paid in submitting any new H-1B visa application and went into effect at 12:01 am EST on Sept. 21, according to a White House\u00a0statement.",
      "Each year, the federal government approves 85,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled non-U.S. workers, who typically require at least a bachelor's degree and a skill in a highly specialized field,\u00a0according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An estimated 700,000 people in the U.S. hold a H-1B visa, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The USCIS says it has already reached its applicant cap for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means those applications would be excluded from having to pay the fee, but new applicants filing during the next fiscal year would be subject to it, Neumann explained.",
      "What are the main issues for current H-1B holders?",
      "According to the White House, the proclamation \"does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa from traveling in and out of the United States.\"",
      "H-1B visas are valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years. A White House official said the one-time $100,000 fee is only charged when applying for a visa for the first time \u2014 the payment is not required for current visa holders or those renewing the document, and those fees aren't changing.",
      "Yet the new rules leave some gray areas for current H-1B holders, Neumann said. For instance, the new fee is targeted at new visa applicants residing outside the U.S. That raises questions about whether current H-1B visa holders who are applying for changes, such as a visa renewal or a change of employer, might be caught up in the new requirement if they leave the U.S., Neumann and other immigration attorneys said.",
      "\"Where the question comes in is, what if after September 21 they file that extension and then they need to travel \u2014 are they going to be expected to pay that in order to get back into the U.S.?\" she said. \"That's kind of an open question right now.\"",
      "Although the White House said the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and won't impact their travel, Neumann said she believes more guidance is needed because the White House's Sept. 21 FAQ notes the fee applies to \"any other H-1B petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025.\"",
      "\"This makes it sound like it could apply to an employee who travels with any petition filed after September 21, 2025. Although it seems clear that it does not apply to individuals currently in the United States, it is not clear how it impacts those who later travel and have a petition filed after the relevant date,\" she said.",
      "For now, Neumann said she is advising her corporate clients to direct their H-1B employees not to leave the U.S.. That was echoed by Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and an immigration attorney.",
      "\"Until we have more clarification, which hopefully we'll have soon, we're telling people to just sit tight and not travel,\" Joseph said.",
      "Asked about the issue of H-1B holders who are applying for a change and who travel outside the U.S., the White House said the one-time $100,000 fee doesn't apply to renewals or current visa holders.",
      "How does the new fee impact the H-1B program?",
      "The $100,000 fee is likely to have a \"chilling effect\" on skilled foreign workers moving to the U.S.,\u00a0Joseph of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said.",
      "Although the tech industry has long been the biggest beneficiary of the H-1B program, the visa is designed for highly skilled workers across many industries, he added. Employers who rely on the visa include those in health care, which often recruit medical professionals outside the U.S. in areas where they have shortages, he said.",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders come from a range of countries, including Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a 2022 USCIS\u00a0report.",
      "What about the national security exemption?",
      "A provision in Mr. Trump's proclamation exempts some workers, companies and even entire industries from the new $100,000 fee if they are deemed to support the \"national interest\" and are adjudged not to pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S.",
      "For now, however, it's unclear how to receive such an exemption, including which federal agency will be charged with approving them, Neumann said.",
      "\"There's no guidance out there yet,\" she said. \"What are the national interest exemptions going to be? How would a company apply for that, if they can get the entire company to get the exemption? How would the individual apply?\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about how the national security exemption would be applied or which agency will be handling the issue.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-us-china-deal-trump/",
    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:12:12 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

    "summary": "The two sides will spend the next two weeks presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that threatens to dismantle the search giant's empire.",
    "story": [
      "After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising.",
      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",
      "Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions.",
      "Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission.",
      "No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined.",
      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",
      "If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology \u2014 a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would \"invite disruption and damage\" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",
      "Google believes it has already made enough changes to its \"Ad Manager\" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling.",
      "The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct.",
      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \"radical\" proposals.",
      "The Justice Department is \"fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,\" Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial.",

      "Emeline Lakrout, a busy New Yorker with a knack for running, rock climbing and swimming, doesn't let being legally blind stop her from living an active lifestyle.",
      "Despite being declared blind at 8 years old, Lakrout has taken on challenges, such as running the New York City Marathon and joining the U.S. National Paraclimbing Team. A new piece of technology \u2014 Meta's AI glasses \u2014 is her latest tool to help her stay savvy and adaptable on a daily basis.",
      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",
      "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the technology.",
      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",
      "The glasses, however, are work in progress says Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind.",
      "\"(They) work well for some things, doesn't work well in other situations,\" he said.",
      "Lakrout discovered this for herself. When she tried the glasses on in a restaurant, they read the menu to her perfectly but couldn't tell her the price for a specific item on second prompt. When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

    "story": [
      "Quinn Cochran-Zipp went to the emergency room three times with severe abdominal pain before doctors figured out that she had early-stage cancer in the germ cells of her right ovary. After emergency surgery four years ago, the Greeley, Colorado, lab technician is cancer-free.",
      "The two hospitals that treated Cochran-Zipp at the time determined that she qualified for 100% financial assistance, since her income as a college student was extremely low. Not having to worry about the roughly $100,000 in bills she racked up for her care was an enormous relief, she said.",
      "Then she started receiving unexpected bills from doctors who worked at the hospitals but, because they weren't on staff there, didn't have to abide by the facilities' financial assistance policies.",
      "Those bills, which came from specialists in emergency medicine, anesthesiology, and radiology who treated her, totaled more than $5,000. Although it was a fraction of the total cost of her care, to Cochran-Zipp it was an enormous amount. She went on payment plans and used scholarship and COVID stimulus money to help cover the bills.",
      "Cochran-Zipp, now 25 and working at a community health center, is applying to medical schools and hopes to enroll next fall. Her experience as a patient has shaped how she thinks about becoming a doctor.",
      "\"I don't think that I could be a provider that, in good conscience, charges patients money in addition to the hospital fees,\" she said.",
      "Hospital financial assistance programs are commonplace, and many patients rely on them. Most offer varying amounts of financial help to uninsured and lower-income people. Eligibility is typically based on a sliding income scale. Some hospitals apply other tests, such as residency.",
      "But even if people qualify for assistance, they may not get discounts. That's because many physicians working at but not for a hospital aren't bound by its financial assistance policies. Hospitals themselves might limit the types of services eligible for discounted or \"charity care,\" as it's sometimes called.",
      "\"It's a hole in the system,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation, a nonprofit that helps patients with serious illnesses cover their medical bills. Case managers who work with patients report that they've seen these problems repeatedly, Donovan said.",
      "In the coming years, more patients will encounter difficulties as demand for financial assistance grows. More than 14 million people are projected to lose health insurance over the next decade, primarily because of changes to the federal Medicaid program and state insurance marketplaces in recently passed tax and spending legislation championed by the Trump administration. Some of these people will likely qualify for discounted care.",
      "Nonprofit hospitals do not pay taxes on the money they make, but to maintain that tax-exempt status, they are required to have policies to help patients pay for emergency and other medically necessary care. For-profit hospitals are not required to offer financial assistance to needy patients, but many do.",
      "However, physicians and other providers who work in a hospital as independent contractors rather than as employees are often not subject to a hospital's financial assistance policy. According to an analysis by the Lown Institute, a health care think tank, physician services in the emergency, radiology, anesthesia, and pathology specialties are commonly excluded from hospital charity care.",
      "For example, at Hartford HealthCare, a large nonprofit health system serving Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, services performed by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants employed by HHC, including emergency department physicians at four of its hospitals, are covered by its financial assistance policy. But treatment by emergency physicians at three HHC hospitals is not covered by the financial assistance policy, since they are not employees. Care by doctors working in radiology, pathology, and anesthesia isn't covered by the financial assistance policy at any HHC facility.",
      "Hartford HealthCare declined to comment on the record for this article.",
      "Health system researchers have identified another potential barrier to patients' receiving help from hospital financial assistance policies. IRS rules require that nonprofit hospitals include emergency and medically necessary care in their charity care policies, but they give hospitals substantial leeway to define what \"medically necessary\" care means.",
      "Historically, excluded care has been limited to services that insurance doesn't typically cover, like cosmetic surgery or experimental treatment. But in recent years, hospitals appear to be defining medically necessary care more narrowly, eliminating financial assistance for care that is needed but not urgently required. Care that might fall into this category could be a kidney stone removal, a cancer biopsy, or a cardiac valve replacement, according to a study published this year in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Although the study of 209 nonprofit hospitals with more than 200 beds found only isolated examples of hospitals \u2014 about 6% of them \u2014 that substantially excluded medically necessary care, researchers are concerned that it could be the leading edge of a larger trend, said Mark Hall, a professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, who co-authored the study.",
      "\"There's not really much in the way of regulatory guidance in what should be in or out\" of a financial assistance policy, said Christopher Goodman, a clinical assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, who has published several studies examining hospital financial assistance policies.",
      "The American Hospital Association declined to comment for this article. American Medical Association spokesperson Robert Mills said that the AMA doesn't have a position on whether all contracted physicians should be required to participate in hospital financial assistance policies.",
      "For-profit hospitals have more latitude to fashion their financial assistance policies as they wish.",
      "At HCA Healthcare, one of the country's largest for-profit health care systems, with nearly 200 hospitals in 20 states and the United Kingdom, discounted or free care is available only for \"emergent or non-elective services.\"",
      "\"Facility charity policies and uninsured discounts are typically specific to emergency services\" at HCA Healthcare, said Harlow Sumerford, an HCA Healthcare spokesperson. \"Any third-party providers are independent and would have their own financial policies.\"",
      "In recent years, several states have passed medical debt protection laws. A few apply to some doctors and other health care providers who practice at health care facilities and bill patients separately for their care.",
      "Colorado's is the most expansive. Under its Hospital Discounted Care law that first took effect in September 2022, covered hospitals have to screen all uninsured people and others who request it for eligibility for Medicaid and other health programs, and provide discounted care to people whose income is up to 250% of the federal poverty level (about $80,000 for a family of four). There are limits on how much qualifying patients can be billed each month and, after three years, their debt is retired.",
      "Under the Colorado law, licensed health care professionals who work at a covered hospital can charge qualified patients no more than the rates set by the state.",
      "\"This rule has been a game changer for folks in Colorado,\" said Melissa Duncan, consumer assistance program manager at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, which helps patients access health care and cover their bills.",
      "Unfortunately, the law didn't pass in time to help Cochran-Zipp.",
      "As hospitals grapple with the changes expected under the federal health care legislation passed this summer, discounted care programs may make a tempting target, say some health care financing experts. Facing higher rates of uncompensated care and trouble collecting payments from patients, facilities may reduce the financial assistance that they offer.",
      "Hospitals may say \"we are going to do all we can to protect our spending,\" said Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University. \"In that environment, charity care will be a burden.\"",

      "\"We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson clarified to CBS News in an email Saturday that the fee \"does not apply to anyone who has a current visa,\" and \"only applies to future applicants in the February [2026] lottery who are currently outside the U.S. It does not apply to anyone who participated in the 2025 lottery.\"",
      "\"The Proclamation does not impact the ability of any current visa holder to travel to/from the U.S.,\" Jackson said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Saturday that the $100,000 is a one-time fee that only applies to new visas and is not an annual payment. It does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, the official said.",
      "This comes after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had told reporters Friday that the fee was \"annual.\"",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CBS News in a statement Saturday. \"It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system.\"",
      "The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have\u00a0relied on the program\u00a0to hire foreign workers.",
      "The plan was\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by Bloomberg News.",
      "H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.",
      "The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.",
      "Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the\u00a0most H1-B visas\u00a0of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.",
      "\"This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,\" a White House aide said.",
      "Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.",
      "\"The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,\" Anderson told CBS News.",
      "Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.",
      "President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.",
      "The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March\u00a0study\u00a0from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.",

    "summary": "Here's why groceries are costing more, and what American consumers can do to save money at the supermarket.",
    "story": [
      "Americans' grocery bills are growing, causing some shoppers to cut back on discretionary spending as they find themselves struggling to afford the basics.",
      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",
      "\"What they want to do is they want to protect themselves. A lot of these big food companies are public companies. So what they've gotta do is they've gotta report back to their shareholders on profit margins. So they've been hedging their bets,\" Lempert said.",
      "Sometimes, packaged-goods companies disguise price hikes by offering consumers less product for the same amount of money. The covert inflation strategy has been dubbed \"shrinkflation,\" Lempert explained.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not gonna observe that and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" he said",
      "Climate change",
      "Increasing temperatures and\u00a0shifts in weather patterns have made conditions for growing some fruits and vegetables in the U.S. inhospitable. As a result, a lot of domestic production has been moved to Central and Latin America, according to Lempert.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" he said.",
      "Labor shortage",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including raids on workplaces that employ large numbers of immigrants, plus waning interest in agricultural work, have led to an industrywide labor shortage, Lempert explained.",
      "Consumers are reacting to higher prices by looking for deals, purchasing store brand goods instead of name-brands and buying shelf-stable groceries in bulk at shopping clubs like Costco.",
      "Lempert said a little planning can go a long way to ensure that consumers can buy what they need.",
      "\"The number one thing that people want to do if they want to save money \u2014 stop wasting food,\" Lempert said.",
      "\"Forty percent of all of our food in this country is wasted. A lot of that's in our homes. So, take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers, don't waste food and you'll save a substantial amount of money,\" he said.",

      "Under the Gold Card program, which Mr. Trump first floated in February, non-Americans who give a gift of at least $1 million to the Commerce Department will be eligible for an \"expedited process\" to gain an immigrant visa, the executive order states. Corporations can sponsor people for Gold Cards if they give the government at least $2 million.",
      "Some 80,000 Gold Cards will be made available, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said the program is still in the \"implementation phase.\"",
      "People who are approved for a Gold Card after vetting by the State Department and Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and who pay a $15,000 \"vetting fee\" \u2014 will be considered lawful permanent residents, more commonly known as green-card holders, Lutnick told reporters Friday. He said Gold Cards will take the place of the existing EB-1 and EB-2 visa programs, which offer green cards to people with \"exceptional ability\" in business or other fields.",
      "\"You can prove exceptional value for the United States of America by contributing $1 million to the United States of America. That's a pretty good expectation that they're highly valuable,\" he said.",
      "Lutnick said: \"In less than a month, the other visa Green Card categories are likely to be suspended, and this will be the model that people can come into the country.\"",
      "The administration is also considering offering a $5 million \"Platinum Card\" that will allow people to spend up to 270 days in the country without paying taxes on their non-U.S. income. That program, which Lutnick said would not offer a pathway to citizenship, will need approval from Congress before it launches. The federal government has set up an online waiting list.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump signed an executive order Friday that imposes an extra $100,000 fee for people who wish to enter the U.S. on an H-1B visa, a non-immigrant visa that allows tens of thousands of people to live and work in the U.S. for up to six years.",
      "The change could mark a substantial crackdown on the H-1B program. Critics argue that the visas allow employers to undercut U.S. workers by sponsoring foreign job applicants willing to work for lower salaries. But supporters of the program argue it is essential to industries like tech that often struggle to find qualified U.S.-based workers \u2014 with firms like Amazon applying for thousands of H-1Bs per year \u2014 and employers are already required to pay H-1B recipients no less than the wages earned by similarly qualified workers.",
      "Asked Friday how he believes tech companies will react to the new H-1B fee, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I think they're going to be very happy.\"",
      "\"And we're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases, these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" the president said.",

    "summary": "Overall grocery prices in August 2025 rose 2.7% compared to one year ago, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index.",
    "story": [
      "Santa Monica, California \u2014 It's no secret that a trip to the grocery store is costing more these days. Food prices grew by a half-percent from July to August, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index \u2014 the fastest monthly change since the fall of 2022.",
      "And overall grocery prices in August rose 2.7% compared to one year ago, according to the CPI.",
      "\"Tariffs have a huge impact on grocery prices,\" food industry analyst Phil Lempert, editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert believes the Trump administration's tariffs are one of three primary reasons that Americans are seeing a rise in grocery prices, with the others being climate change and labor shortages.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" Lempert said of the impact of climate change. \"... Now it's had to move to Central and Latin America... Number two is the labor shortage... And then third is our tariffs.\"",
      "One of the products that has seen some of the biggest price jumps is coffee, which has jumped 21.7% compared to one year ago, according to the CPI.",
      "\"We got 50% tariffs on coffee from Brazil, and we import about 35% of our coffee beans, unroasted, from Brazil,\" Lempert said. \"... Yes, coffee's going to get more expensive.\"",
      "He also says the U.S. should brace for shrinkflation \u2014 when food and product manufacturers keep prices the same, but reduce the size of items, meaning consumers are ultimately paying more for the same amount.",
      "A September 2024 analysis from Lending Tree found that about one-third of approximately 100 common consumer products had shrunk in size or servings since the start of the pandemic.",
      "As an example, Lempert showed CBS News coffee bean packets in one grocery store in Santa Monica, California, that used to be sold in 16-ounce sizes, but are now 10.5 ounces.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not going to observe that, and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" Lempert explained.",
      "Lempert says shrinkflation is \"absolutely not\" going away. According to his analysis, higher prices are changing consumer behavior, with more shoppers choosing less expensive store brands, shopping at multiple stores in an effort to find deals, and buying in bulk.",
      "\"No. 1, always have a shopping list,\" says Lempert on his advice on seeking out savings. \"... Don't waste food... Take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers. And then, obviously, use your coupons. Use your frequent shopper card. Do everything you can to compare prices before you head to the store.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hyundai Motor Group on Thursday confirmed it is going forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, just weeks after an immigration raid delayed the startup of an electric vehicle battery plant at the site.",
      "As part of a broader investment strategy, Hyundai said it would spend $2.7 billion to increase production capacity at the Ellabell site by 200,000 over the next three years, to a total of 500,000 vehicles a year.",
      "The company first announced the expansion in March at the grand opening of the plant west of Savannah, and had said in August that it would invest an additional $5 billion in the United States overall. But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S.",
      "The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production. Hyundai says it's still on track to expand production worldwide to 5.6 million vehicles a year by 2030. The automaker pledged that 60% of those vehicles will be electric or hybrid powered, targeting sales in South Korea, North America and Europe.",
      "Hyundai said that it plans to make more than 80% of vehicles sold in the United States domestically by 2030, with total domestic content increasing from 60% to 80%. For the first time, the vehicles would include a mid-sized pickup truck, a key vehicle class in the U.S. market. The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.",
      "Hyundai CEO Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz has said the immigration raid will delay opening\u00a0the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.",
      "Both Hyundai executives and Georgia officials have been trying to calm the situation since the raid, which mushroomed into a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and the United States.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters Tuesday at a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle plant that he remains confident Georgia's business advantages would \"win out\" in terms of foreign investment. The raid may even wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States, he said.",
      "\"I've had good conversations with companies that are here doing business in Georgia, companies that are looking to do business here,\" Kemp said. \"And I've had good conversations with people in the White House about the visa issue.\"",
      "Brent Stubbs, the chief administrative officer of the Ellabell site, wrote in an opinion piece published Wednesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the company is still committed to Georgia.",
      "\"This situation doesn't change our plans to continue expanding and localizing in the United States,\" Stubbs wrote. \"Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.\"",
      "The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said. Hyundai and its onsite affiliates currently have 3,129 employees in Ellabell, he said.",
      "Hyundai and its joint-venture partner in the battery plant, LG Energy Solution, had previously announced $12.6 billion of investments at the Georgia site, with pledges to hire at least 8,500 workers by the end of 2031. State and local governments have promised $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.",
      "The boost at the Ellabell site is the biggest part Hyundai's plan to raise production by 1.2 million vehicles a year worldwide. That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai's electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea. The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.",
      "Hyundai underlined a previous announcement to deepen its investment in robotics and said that by 2027 it would launch extended-range electric vehicles with gasoline motors to extend the range of its electric batteries to more than 600 miles (960 kilometers).",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow President Trump to fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the high court, the Justice Department said that the justices should freeze a lower court decision that ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled earlier this week that Cook could remain\u00a0in her role while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "Mr. Trump's emergency appeal to the high court comes after Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's committee that sets interest rates this week. The central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, its first cut since December. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed for moving too slowly to lower interest rates.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the request to the Supreme Court. \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "Lisa Cook's firing",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook last month over allegations she made misrepresentations on mortgage filings. She has not been charged with any crime and denies wrongdoing. Cook's removal by Mr. Trump was unprecedented \u2014 no president has attempted to remove a Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics warned that it threatened the independence of the Fed.",
      "Cook swiftly filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act. The law specifies that a president can only remove a governor \"for cause.\" Cook also argued her due process rights were violated because she was not provided notice of the allegations against her and a meaningful opportunity to respond.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with Cook earlier this month, finding that her firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. She ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The Trump administration sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which left Cobb's order intact. Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion that Cook is likely to succeed in her claim that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate her violated her due process rights. But he wrote that the court did not need to address the meaning of \"for cause\" at this stage in the case.",
      "The White House had said the administration would seek the Supreme Court's intervention, as it has done in several other legal challenges to Mr. Trump's efforts to remove Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies. The high court has so far allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, but it acknowledged in May that the Fed is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "In his filing, Sauer argued that Cook received adequate notice and opportunity to contest her removal.",
      "\"The President notified Cook of the charges against her and waited five days for her to respond before removing her,\" he wrote. \"Having declined to bring any defense to the President's attention or to dispute any material facts, Cook cannot complain about insufficient process.\"",
      "The solicitor general noted that the administration is not contesting the constitutionality of the for-cause removal protection for members of the Fed Board, but instead believes the president's firing of Cook complies with it. Still, Sauer said the district court's finding that conduct that occurred before Cook was appointed to the Fed does not constitute \"cause\" under the Federal Reserve Act\u00a0 was \"flawed.\"",
      "\"The President's strong concerns about the appearance of mortgage fraud, based on facially contradictory representations made to obtain mortgages by someone whose job is to set interest rates that affect Americans' mortgages, satisfies any conception of cause,\" he wrote. \"That is especially true here, where Cook has not disputed any material fact or offered any plausible justification for her conduct.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he was\u00a0firing Cook, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud.\" Documents obtained by The Associated Press this week showed that Cook referred to the property as a \"vacation home\" in a loan estimate, potentially undercutting the Trump administration's claims of fraud.",

      "\"It's been overwhelming...I've heard from all the people in the world over the last six days,\" Kimmel joked to open his monologue, going on to thank all those who came out in his defense, including conservatives.",
      "\"Most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,\" Kimmel said. \"I never would have imagined that Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, even my old pal Ted Cruz, who believe it or not said something very beautiful on my behalf. It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration. They did and they deserve credit for it.\"",
      "The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, had announced Monday that Kimmel would return to the air.",
      "It followed a political and media firestorm that began after the comedian addressed Kirk's slaying in a Sept. 15 monologue, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"",
      "An emotional Kimmel Tuesday said that \"it's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,\" adding that he had taken to social media following Kirk's death to send his condolences to Kirk's family.",

I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company\u2026they welcomed be back on the air.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!\"",
      "He went on, \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,\" Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, \u2014 which the network settled in December by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million towards Mr. Trump's legal fees.",
      "\"This one sounds even more lucrative,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"A true bunch of losers!\"",

    "story": [
      "A malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter at the United Nations' New York City headquarters drew President Trump's frustration on Tuesday \u2014 though the U.N. says a videographer from Mr. Trump's delegation may have triggered the escalator's safety shutoff.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump entered U.N. headquarters to address world leaders at this year's General Assembly session, they stepped onto an escalator. But the machine ground to a halt almost immediately, forcing both Trumps to start climbing the stairs on their own, videos of his arrival show.",
      "Later, as Mr. Trump began his speech to the General Assembly, he remarked that his teleprompter wasn't working. \"I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,\" the president said, drawing laughs from the audience.",
      "The president brought up the two mishaps later in his speech, framing them as metaphors for what he views as the incompetence of the United Nations \u2014 which he accused of offering up little more than \"empty words.\"",
      "\"All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would've fallen,\" the president said. \"These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later floated a different explanation, writing in a post on X: \"If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately.\"",
      "Leavitt shared a screenshot from a Times of London article that reported U.N. workers had been overheard joking they might intentionally shut off escalators during Mr. Trump's visit and blame funding shortfalls. There is no evidence that U.N. staff followed through on those jokes.",
      "The press secretary later told Fox News that the Secret Service is looking into the matter.",
      "\"When you put all of this together, it doesn't look like a coincidence to me,\" Leavitt said on Fox News' \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\" \"And if we find that these were U.N. staffers who were purposefully trying to trip up, literally trip up, the president and the first lady of the United States, well, there better be accountability for those people.\"",
      "However, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday the escalator may have suddenly stopped because of a videographer from the U.S. delegation who can be seen walking ahead of the president and first lady on the escalator, seemingly to film their arrival.",
      "\"A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator. The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing. The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function described above,\" St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said in a statement.",
      "Separately, a U.N. official told CBS News that the White House operated the teleprompter for Mr. Trump when it malfunctioned during his speech.",
      "A federal law enforcement source confirmed to CBS News that the Secret Service is looking into the matter.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump's speech came as his second administration distances itself from the U.N., withdrawing the U.S. from agencies like the Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. The administration has also cut its financial contributions to the U.N. and criticized its approach to Israel.",
      "\"The U.N. has such tremendous potential,\" the president said in his speech, \"but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.\"",

      "Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that Zelenskyy's forces are \"in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form\" with Europe's help.\u00a0 The unexpected remarks \u2014 which called the Russian military a \"paper tiger\" \u2014 came after Mr. Trump met with Zelenskyy for about an hour Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.",
      "The comments appear to mark a dramatic shift for Mr. Trump, who said last month he expected \"some swapping of territories\" as part of an eventual Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal. Russia occupies large parts of eastern Ukraine, including territories captured in 2014 and in the current war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Asked later Tuesday by Fox News' Bret Baier if he was surprised by the U.S. president's about-face, Zelenskyy laughed and responded, \"a little bit.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said he and Mr. Trump had a positive conversation on Tuesday, and he believes Mr. Trump's position on territorial swaps has changed.",
      "\"I think he understands for today that we can't just swap territories. It's not fair,\" he said.",
      "During their meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that Zelenskyy was \"putting up one hell of a fight,\" and he believes the \"biggest progress\" is that the Russian economy is \"terrible.\" But the U.S. leader didn't appear optimistic about a quick resolution to the war, telling reporters, \"It looks like it's not going to end for a long time.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire deal to end their more than three-year-long war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "But a deal has remained elusive as both sides' public positions remain far apart. The Kremlin has pushed Zelenskyy to fully withdraw from large swaths of eastern Ukraine, an idea Zelenskyy has rejected as unfair and unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Ukraine has sought international security guarantees to deter another Russian attack if the current conflict ends.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin at various points. He met with Putin in Alaska last month, but he has criticized the Russian leader for continued strikes on Ukraine, and said last week that Putin had \"really let me down.\"",
      "The U.S. president also pressed NATO countries earlier this month to stop buying Russian oil and to impose hefty tariffs on China, which has remained aligned with Russia, writing that those moves could \"be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.\"",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he believes NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace, after Russian drones entered Poland earlier this month and Russian fighter jets allegedly entered Estonian airspace.",
      "At other points, though, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy have had a rocky relationship. An Oval Office meeting between the two leaders earlier this year descended into a shouting match, and Mr. Trump has occasionally blamed Zelenskyy for the war.",
      "During his interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he believes his relationship with his American counterpart has improved.",
      "\"I think we have better relation[s] than before,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I think we didn't have close relation[s] because we didn't have, maybe, time. I don't know.\"",

      "In the largest seizure of its kind, the U.S. Secret Service announced Tuesday that the agency found active SIM farms at abandoned apartment buildings located at more than five sites. In total, law enforcement discovered 300 SIM servers \u2013 over 100,000 SIM cards \u2013 enabling encrypted, anonymous communication and capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. Officials say the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch.",
      "\"This network had the potential to disable cell phone towers and essentially shut down the cellular network in New York City,\" U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool said in a video released by the agency.",
      "An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that this week, the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes,\" later adding, \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "Telephonic threats to multiple senior U.S. officials this past spring \u2013 including multiple people protected by the Secret Service \u2013 first triggered the investigation, but officials say the network was seized within the last three weeks.",
      "\"We cannot share which officials were targeted out of concerns for their privacy, but as the forensics investigation continues, we do expect that we will find more targeted officials once we get through that data,\" McCool said.",
      "Early analysis shows the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement, including members of known organized crime gangs, drug cartels and human trafficking rings, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. The U.S. Secret Service says it is combing through the more than 100,000 SIM cards in an ongoing, exhaustive forensic analysis.",
      "\"Each SIM basically has the equivalent data of a cell phone. So we're working through every call, every text, every search made on those SIM cards,\" an official told CBS News, adding, \"Early analysis indicates that this network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement here in the U.S.\"",
      "The equipment was found within 35 miles of the United Nations in New York, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. Investigators also found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, plus computers and phones.",
      "\"This isn't a group of people in a basement playing a video game and trying to play a prank,\" one official said. \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "\"The timing, the location, the proximity of this network had the potential to impact the U.N. and that was clear and something that we had to consider,\" added McCool.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rfk-jr-distort-facts-autism-tylenol-vaccines/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 19:48:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The White House's autism announcement exaggerates links to Tylenol, misleads on vaccines, and sets back the field by ignoring decades of research, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Ann Bauer, a researcher who studies Tylenol and autism, felt queasy with anxiety in the weeks leading up to the White House's much-anticipated autism announcement.",
      "In August, Bauer and her colleagues published an analysis of 46 previous studies on Tylenol, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Many found no link between the drug and the conditions, while some suggested Tylenol might occasionally exacerbate other potential causes of autism, such as genetics.",
      "Bauer, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, and her team called for more judicious use of the drug until the science is settled.",
      "On Monday, President Trump stood beside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what he called a \"historic\" announcement on autism. \"If you're pregnant, don't take Tylenol, and don't give it to the baby after the baby is born,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines and don't take any pills that have no autism,\" he added, without providing evidence. \"They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it's a disgrace.\"",
      "A fact sheet released alongside the White House briefing cited Bauer's analysis. But she was alarmed by Mr. Trump's comments. If prenatal Tylenol has any association, which it may not, it would help account for only a fraction of cases, she said. Further, research has not deeply examined Tylenol risks in young children, and many rigorous studies refute a link between vaccines and autism.",
      "Bauer worries such statements will cut both ways: People may put themselves at risk to avoid vaccines and Tylenol, the only safe painkiller for use during pregnancy. And she frets that scientists might outright reject her team's measured concerns about Tylenol in a backlash against misleading remarks from Mr. Trump and other members of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement.",
      "\"I'm really concerned about how this message is going to play out,\" she said. \"It's a sound-bite universe, and everyone wants a simple solution.\"",
      "Autism experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were neither consulted for the White House's long-awaited autism announcement nor asked to review a draft of the findings and recommendations, CDC scientists told KFF Health News, which agreed not to identify them because they fear retaliation.",
      "\"Typically, we'd be asked to provide information and review the report for accuracy, but we've had absolutely no contact with anyone,\" one CDC researcher said. \"It is very unusual.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Kennedy promised this year that under their leadership the federal government would swiftly figure out what causes autism. Scientists who work in the field have been skeptical, noting that decades of research has shown that no single drug, chemical, or other environmental factor is strongly linked to the developmental disorder. In addition, both Mr. Trump and Kennedy have repeated the scientifically debunked notion that childhood vaccines may cause autism.",
      "Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence at Boston University, called Mr. Trump's comments dangerous. Fevers can harm the mother and the developing fetus, she said, adding that fevers are more strongly associated with autism than Tylenol.",
      "In an emailed response to queries, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, \"We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America's unprecedented rise in autism rates.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote, \"President Trump pledged to address America's rising rate of autism, and to do so with Gold Standard Science.\"",
      "Had CDC scientists been allowed to brief Kennedy, they say they would have cautioned that simple fixes won't make a dent in the number of autism cases in the United States: As many as 1 in 31 8-year-old children had autism spectrum disorder in 2022.",
      "Systemic changes, such as regulations on air pollution, which has been linked to asthma and developmental disabilities including autism, and assistance for parents of disabled children, could improve lives for far more Americans with autism and other conditions than actions taken by the Trump administration on Sept. 22, researchers say.",
      "One federal action is to consider updating the label on Tylenol and to \"encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.\" The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already recommends acetaminophen \"as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.\"",
      "\"Political crusade\"",
      "Despite Kennedy's many years of speaking about autism, he rarely cites credible autism research or expert recommendations, Tager-Flusberg said. Instead, Kennedy repeats fringe, scientifically debunked theories linking vaccines to autism, despite rigorous studies published in peer-reviewed journals that refute a link.",
      "At the Sept. 22 briefing, Mr. Trump said he spoke with Kennedy about autism 20 years ago: \"We understood a lot more than a lot of people who studied it,\" he said. Ahead of Mr. Trump's first term in 2017, Kennedy said he met with the president to consider a commission on vaccine safety and autism. It didn't happen then. But soon after Kennedy was confirmed as health secretary, he called autism \"preventable,\" pointed to \"environmental toxins,\" and contradicted the results of a CDC study finding that the main driver of rising autism diagnoses was that doctors increasingly recognize the disorder.",
      "At a televised Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Mr. Trump, \"By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures.\"",
      "\"You stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it's a shot,\" Mr. Trump replied.",
      "\"He is on a political crusade,\" Tager-Flusberg said of Kennedy, adding that vaccines, Tylenol, aluminum, and food dyes make for simple targets to rally against. \"We know genetics is the most significant risk factor,\" she said, \"but you can't blame Big Pharma for genetics, and you can't build a political movement on genetics research and ride to victory.\"",
      "\"RFK makes our work harder,\" said Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher and the author of a book about his autistic daughter, \"Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism.\" He said the book stemmed from conversations with Kennedy in 2017, in which Hotez shared studies pinpointing more than a hundred genes linked to autism, and research into the complex interplay between genetics, biological processes, and things that children and fetuses encounter during development.",
      "\"I sat down with him and explained what the science says, but he was unwilling or incapable of thinking deeply about it,\" Hotez said. \"He is extremely careless.\"",
      "In addition to its focus on Tylenol, the White House said it would move to update \"prescribing information\" on leucovorin \u2014 a medication related to the B vitamin folate \u2014 to reflect its use as an autism treatment. A small clinical trial in 2012-13 suggested the drug may help treat language problems in some children with autism. Tager-Flusberg said the findings warrant further study but clarified these were \"old data, not a breakthrough.\"",
      "Likewise, studies finding a modest association between autism and prolonged Tylenol use were published years ago. Researchers have suggested the medicine might occasionally exacerbate factors associated with autism, such as genetics and oxidative stress, a biological condition that occurs for a variety of reasons that scientists are still unraveling.",
      "Still, these studies couldn't rule out the possibility that fevers prompting women to take Tylenol, rather than the medicine itself, might instead be to blame. Fevers and infections \u2014 including those prevented by vaccines \u2014 have also been linked to autism.",
      "Nonetheless, Bauer's recommendation would be to pause before taking acetaminophen while pregnant \u2014 blanket advice that doctors give for all medications during that period, but which may be ignored. \"Try to alleviate discomfort in some other ways, like with a cold compress, hydration, or massage, before taking it,\" Bauer said.",
      "She welcomed the White House's motion to consider labeling Tylenol to emphasize judicious use of the drug but worries about how the MAHA movement might distort a careful message. On Sept. 2, the right-wing news outlet One America News Network posted an interview with newly appointed CDC vaccine adviser Robert Malone, writing that Malone \"speculates RFK Jr. may have an important announcement this month regarding a potential link between Tylenol, multiple vaccinations and autism in children.\"",
      "\"I was sick to my stomach,\" Bauer said, concerned that Kennedy would link her study to discredited theories, causing doctors and scientists to reject her far more measured work.",
      "\"The boy who cried wolf\"",
      "Several medical and scientific associations have called for Kennedy's removal or resignation. Many scientists are skeptical of what he says because much of it has been misleading or wrong. For example, he's said HIV isn't the only cause of AIDS (it is), that antidepressant drugs cause mass shootings (they don't), that older adults don't have severe autism (some do), that the measles vaccine causes brain swelling (it doesn't), that COVID vaccines were the deadliest vaccines ever made (they aren't), that vaccines aren't safety-tested (they are), and that vaccines contribute to autism (they don't).",
      "\"This is like the boy who cried wolf,\" said Brian Lee, an epidemiologist at Drexel University. \"One day he might be right about something and Americans who are not prone to conspiracies won't trust it because it's coming from RFK's mouth. And that could be a problem.\"",
      "What's more, the Trump administration is eroding scientists' ability to probe the safety of pharmaceuticals, said Robert Steinbrook, head of health research at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer protection group.",
      "\"Public Citizen is very supportive of research on medications that could be linked to diseases,\" he said. \"But it needs to be through an open process, which looks at scientific evidence, and which doesn't cherry-pick studies to support a preconceived point of view.\"",
      "Steinbrook said the administration has undermined his confidence in the government's ability to conduct credible work. The Food and Drug Administration has held less than a third the number of advisory committee meetings this year as it did last, meaning fewer opportunities for experts to discuss research on the risks and benefits of drugs. The Trump administration has fired hundreds of career scientists at the CDC and FDA and cut millions of dollars in research funds, including to projects studying autism.",
      "In early September, the CDC issued an unusual contract with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to analyze datasets for signs that vaccinated children were more likely to have autism. Unlike with other research initiatives, the CDC didn't post an open call for applications in advance. This allows agency experts to review proposals and select studies best designed to answer the question at hand.",
      "CDC researchers told KFF Health News that experts in the agency's autism and disability group weren't aware of the contract or asked to review the proposal. That's important, they said, because researchers digging through data to find clues about autism must show how they'll rule out biological and environmental exposures that muddy the results, and ensure that children have been accurately diagnosed. One researcher said, \"It absolutely looks like Kennedy has subverted the grantmaking process.\"",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to KFF Health News' requests for information on the grant, including through a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "The new vaccine study is separate from Kennedy's autism data-science initiative, which was posted as an open call at the National Institutes of Health. \"The hope is that something good comes of it, and that the government won't cherry-pick or censor what scientists find out,\" Lee said.",
      "Bauer said she didn't apply to be part of the initiative because of Kennedy's outsize presence at HHS.",
      "\"I would not take his funding because it could take away from the credibility of my study,\" she said, \"in the same way that taking money from pharmaceutical companies does.\"",

      "Health experts from around the globe are joining the chorus of doctors and organizations pushing back against the Trump administration's announcement Monday\u00a0linking the use of acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications \u2014 during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children.",
      "\"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,\" President Trump said at a news conference with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the European Union's European Medicines Agency said there is currently \"no new evidence\" that would require changes to the current EU recommendations for use of acetaminophen, also commonly called paracetamol outside the U.S.",
      "\"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,\" Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. \"Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.\"",
      "The United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said Tuesday, \"taking paracetamol during pregnancy remains safe.\"",
      "\"There is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children,\" the agency's chief safety officer Dr. Alison Cave said in the statement.",
      "In a combined statement, Australia's chief medical officer and the country's medicine regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, said they were joining \"other global medicines regulators, leading clinicians and scientists worldwide in rejecting claims regarding the use of paracetamol in pregnancy, and the subsequent risk of development of ADHD or autism in children.\"",
      "\"Robust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims,\" the statement continued.",
      "While sharing a statement from Spain's Ministry of Health that stated paracetamol can be used during pregnancy, the country's minister of health, M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda, called out Mr. Trump specifically for misinformation and lack of evidence.",
      "\"Trump's new crusade is against paracetamol during pregnancy, ignoring all scientific evidence,\" she wrote on X. \"This denialism only sows alarm and misinformation. It's better to listen to health authorities than to the person who suggested injecting bleach against COVID,\" referring to a remark Mr. Trump made in 2020.",
      "A World Health Organization spokesperson said Tuesday that evidence of a link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism \"remains inconsistent,\" according to Reuters.",
      "International-based studies have been part of the evidence that shows acetaminophen use during pregnancy is safe.",
      "In a\u00a0major study published last year, for example, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "In the U.S., organizations \u2014 including one that represents those who treat pregnant patients, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u2014 have countered the claimed link, saying there's \"no clear evidence.\"",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump suggested Tuesday that London officials want to \"go to sharia law,\" a comment London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office called \"bigoted\" and \"appalling.\"",
    "story": [
      "London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office called President Trump's comments \"bigoted,\" after the president appeared to make the false claim that London wants to \"go to sharia law\" and was a city that had \"changed\" under the mayor's leadership.",
      "\"I have to say, I look at London where you have a terrible mayor \u2014 terrible, terrible mayor \u2014 and it's been so changed, so changed,\" Mr. Trump said during his address to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. \"Now they want to go to sharia law ... Both their immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump used the word \"they\" without clarifying if he meant Khan and London, his comments echoed long running far-right conspiracy theories online linking Khan, who is the first Muslim to be elected mayor of London, to Islamic fundamentalism. There is no evidence that Khan has advocated for London to officially adopt Sharia, a system of religious laws that is used in some Muslim countries but not by the U.K. government.",
      "\"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response,\" a spokesperson for London's mayor told CBS News in an e-mailed statement Tuesday. \"London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.\"",
      "In response, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said: \"President Trump is right \u2014 unchecked migration into western countries is making the world a more dangerous place.\"",
      "A number of politicians in Britain came to Khan's defense following Mr. Trump's comments, including members of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. Khan is a member of Starmer's ruling, left-leaning Labour party.",
      "\"Sadiq Khan is not trying to impose Sharia Law on London,\" U.K. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in a post on X Tuesday. \"This is a Mayor who marches with pride, who stands up for differences of background and opinion, who's focused on improving our transport, our air, our streets, our safety, our choices and chances.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks \u2014 made within a wider context of criticizing the immigration policy of European countries \u2014 revived a spat between Khan and the president that stretches back nearly a decade.",
      "In 2015, Sadiq Khan roundly condemned then-candidate Donald Trump after he called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" on national security grounds, following a terrorist attack in California. Early in his first term, Mr. Trump moved to restrict travel to the U.S. by residents of several mostly Muslim countries, though it did not explicitly ban entry to the U.S. by all Muslims.",
      "That initial criticism has led to a colorful back-and-forth between the two over the years. Just last week, Mr. Trump said Khan was \"among the worst mayors in the world,\" and told reporters that he asked that Khan not be present at the banquet hosted by King Charles III during the president's state visit to the U.K.",
      "Mr. Trump has also often claimed that crime in London has risen dramatically during Khan's tenure, including in last week's comments to reporters, when he said crime in London was \"through the roof.\"",
      "Overall recorded crime in London has increased by 31.5% over the past 10 years, with violent crime increasing by 40%, according to U.K. office for National Statistics data cited by CBS News' partners at the BBC. Khan first took office as London's mayor in May 2016.",
      "But data from the Metropolitan Police shows that London had a homicide rate of 11.8 per million people in 2024. That makes the homicide rate in England's capital lower than in a number of major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., according to data cited by the White House.",

      "A Florida jury on Tuesday found Ryan Routh guilty of an assassination attempt against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.",
      "Routh represented himself in the trial. He was found guilty of all five charges, which included attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer.",
      "Routh was arrested in September 2024 at Mr. Trump's golf course. A Secret Service agent testified last week that he spotted Routh before the then-presidential candidate came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot, the agent said.",
      "After the verdict was read, Routh apparently tried to harm himself, possibly using a pen that was on his desk, to stab himself in the neck. His daughter cried out during the incident and U.S. marshals eventually tackled him.",
      "It was the second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in 2024, after shots were fired in a separate incident at a Pennsylvania rally. A bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear in that incident.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the guilty verdict against Routh \"illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence,\" and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the verdict sends \"a clear message\" that an \"attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate is an attack on our Republic and on the rights of every citizen.\"",
      "A federal district judge will determine his sentence. He faces life in prison.",
      "In a nearly hourlong closing argument on Tuesday, Routh said that there was no intent to kill because the trigger was never pulled, the gun was never fired and that no one was hurt, so \"no crime.\"",
      "\"I wanted to kill, my actions within the community and toward my co-workers and family should show my obvious non-violence and gentleness,\" Routh said. Speaking about himself in the third person, he said the shooting was never going to happen because it was \"never in his heart.\"",
      "But prosecutors said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Mr. Trump, who was then running for president. Prosecutors laid out Routh's actions ahead of the incident, saying \"those aren'tcoincidences \u2026 that's a plan,\" prosecutor Christopher Brown said in his closing argument.",
      "\"He had a loaded round in the chamber and the safety off,\" Brown said. \"We don't have to prove motive, but you already have it. You only have to decide intent.\"",
      "Prosecutors also alleged in court filings that Routh attempted to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane.",
      "Routh had initially submitted a witness list that included Mr. Trump, as well as Columbia activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi \u2014 to whom his connections are unclear \u2014 and several prominent authors. Judge Aileen Canon had rejected many of these potential witnesses.",

      "\"After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Last week, the House approved a measure to keep the government funded until Nov. 21, along with funds for additional security for lawmakers and other officials in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. Democrats put forward their own proposal, which would extend government funding until Oct. 31 and boost security funding. The Democrats' proposal also includes a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, and a clawback of the some of the policies put in place by Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year.",
      "Both proposals fell short in the Senate last Friday, raising fears that government funding will lapse at the end of the month.",
      "Congress is now in recess until next week, when the Senate will return with just days to act. House GOP leaders extended the lower chamber's break past the Oct. 1 deadline to pressure the Senate to adopt their bill.",
      "Meanwhile, Schumer and Jeffries have repeatedly asked GOP leaders to negotiate with them on a short-term funding extension. In a letter to Mr. Trump over the weekend, Schumer and Jeffries demanded a meeting with the president, saying Democrats would not support a \"dirty spending bill\" that does not address their health care priorities. Earlier Tuesday, the Democrats announced that following \"weeks of Republican stonewalling in Congress, President Trump has agreed to meet this week in the Oval Office.\"",
      "In his Truth Social post, the president railed against the Democratic proposal to extend government funding, which would roll back cuts to Medicaid, and restore funding for public radio and TV stations that was cut earlier this year in a rescissions package. He said \"I look forward to meeting with them if they get serious about the future of our Nation.\"",
      "\"To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for,\" he said. \"DO THE RIGHT THING!\"",
      "In a post on X in response, Jeffries said \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump just cancelled a high stakes meeting in the Oval Office with myself and Leader Schumer,\" Jeffries said. \"The extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America.\"",
      "Schumer also chimed in, telling the president, \"When you're finished ranting, we can sit down and discuss health care.\"",
      "\"Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job. Democrats are ready to work to avoid a shutdown\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Trump and Republicans are holding America hostage. Donald Trump will own the shutdown.\"",

      "This year, the Trump administration's immigration crackdowns, a federally led English-only initiative and an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion push have changed the national climate in which these celebrations occur. Organizers across the country, from Massachusetts and North Carolina to California and Washington state, have postponed or canceled heritage month festivals altogether.",
      "Celebrated each year from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, the month is a chance for many in the U.S. to learn about and celebrate the contributions of Hispanic cultures, the country's fastest-growing racial or ethnic minority, according to the U.S. Census. The group includes people whose ancestors come from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America.",
      "More than 68 million people identify as ethnically Hispanic in the U.S., according to the latest census estimates.",
      "Before there was National Hispanic Heritage Month, there was Hispanic Heritage Week, which was created through legislation sponsored by Mexican American U.S. Rep Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles and signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.",
      "The weeklong commemoration was expanded to a month two decades later, with legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.",
      "\"It was clustered around big celebrations for the community,\" Alberto Lammers, director of communications at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute said. \"It became a chance for people to know Hispanic cultures, for Latinos to get to know a community better and for the American public to understand a little better the long history of Latinos in the U.S.\"",
      "Sept. 15 was chosen as the starting point to coincide with the anniversary of \"El Grito de Dolores,\" or the \"Cry of Dolores,\" which was issued in 1810 from a town in Mexico that launched the country's war for independence from Spain.",
      "The Central American nations of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica celebrate their independence on Sept. 15 and Mexico marks its national day on Sept. 16, the day after the cry for independence.",

      "Hispanic was a term coined by the federal government for people descended from Spanish-speaking cultures. But for some, the label has a connotation of political conservatism and emphasizes a connection to Spain. It sometimes gets mistakenly interchanged with \"Latino\" or \"Latinx.\"",
      "For some, Latino reflects their ties to Latin America. So some celebrations are referred to as Latinx or Latin Heritage Month.",
      "Latin Americans are not a monolith. There are several other identifiers for Latin Americans, depending largely on personal preference. Mexican Americans who grew up during the 1960s Civil Rights era may identify as Chicano. Other may go by their family's nation of origin such as Colombian American or Salvadoran American.",
      "Each culture has unique differences when it comes to music, food, art and other cultural touchstones.",
      "September typically has no shortage of festivities. Events often include traditional Latin foods and entertainment like mariachi bands, folkl\u00f3rico and salsa dance lessons. The intent is to showcase the culture of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and other Latin countries.",
      "Masked ICE agents carrying out President Trump's policies via workplace raids at farms, manufacturing plants and elsewhere - which has included detaining legal residents - led some to fear large gatherings would become additional targets for raids. Another obstacle heritage celebrations face is the perception that they'd violate bans on DEI programming - something Mr. Trump has discouraged across federal agencies. Some companies and universities have followed suit.",
      "Early in September, organizers of a Mexican Independence festival in Chicago announced they would postpone celebrations due to Trump's promises of an immigration crackdown in the city.",
      "\"It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake - and that's a risk we are unwilling to take,\" said the organizers of the festival.",
      "A new date has not yet been announced. Though Mexican Independence Day falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago typically span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants for lively parades, festivals, street parties and car caravans.",
      "\"The fact that the federal government is sending troops as we start these celebrations is an insult,\" Illinois state Sen. Karina Villa, a Democrat, said at a news conference. \"It is a fear tactic. It's unforgivable.\"",
      "Similarly, Sacramento's annual Mexican Independence Day festival was canceled with organizers citing the political climate and safety concerns.",
      "Other events that have been canceled include the Hispanic Heritage Festival of the Carolinas, Hispanic Heritage Fest in Kenner, Louisiana and FIESTA Indianapolis.",

      "Before\u00a0Charlie Kirk died, that group had scheduled an event at the University of Minnesota. In the wake of his death, the American Comeback Tour, put on by Turning Point USA, continued as planned.",

He took time to speak about the man Charlie Kirk was and the fight he had in him, and asked supporters to honor him by turning to their faith. Several students WCCO spoke to said that was the message they wanted to hear.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 09:25:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Legal experts say Trump lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, but the planned move could still affect some law enforcement approaches.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed an executive order Monday labeling antifa as a \"domestic terrorist organization\" after teasing the move last week. But what that action means for the movement remains unclear, given that antifa has no official leadership or organization structure, and the president lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, experts say.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order directs the federal government to use \"all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle\" illegal operations conducted by antifa or any purported adherent, including taking investigatory or prosecutorial action against those who provide funding.",
      "The president's move came as he and his supporters have continued to denounce \"radical left wing political violence\" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. After Kirk's killing, Mr. Trump blamed rhetoric from the \"radical left,\" saying that it is \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Officials described the attack on Kirk as \"targeted,\" and family members of the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, said he had \"become more political\" in recent years. Robinson wrote in text messages to his roommate that he had carried out the attack because he \"had enough of [Kirk's] hatred,\" according to court filings. There has not been evidence presented to the public linking Robinson to antifa.",
      "This is not the first time Mr. Trump has argued antifa poses a threat \u2014 in his first term, he claimed the movement was behind looting and rioting during protests against police brutality in 2020. A November 2021 report on anarchist and left-wing violence in the U.S. from George Washington University's Program on Extremism and the National Counterrorism, Innovation, Technology and Education Center noted that the first Trump administration largely labeled the threat from anarchist violent extremists as originating from antifa.",
      "What is antifa?",
      "Short for \"anti-fascist,\" antifa activism can be traced back to antiracists who opposed the activities of members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, according to a June 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service. But the movement gained attention after the violent clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.",
      "The Congressional Research Service describes antifa as \"decentralized\" and lacking a \"unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\" Instead, it consists of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" that largely believe in the principles of anarchism, socialism and communism.",
      "\"There is no single organization called antifa. That's just not the way these activists have ever organized themselves,\" said Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied antifa. \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"",
      "The FBI has warned about violence perpetrated by antifa adherents, and in 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress that the bureau was looking into \"a number of what we would call anarchist extremist investigations, where we have properly predicated subjects who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" according to CRS.",
      "Wray, who was appointed FBI director by Mr. Trump during his first term, also acknowledged in congressional testimony in 2019 that the FBI doesn't investigate ideology, but does investigate violence. Then, in 2020, he said antifa is a \"movement or an ideology,\" not an organization.",
      "A 2020 assessment from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that far-right attacks and plots have outpaced those from other perpetrators, including far-left networks. A 2022 study from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism also found that \"right-wing extremists\" are more violent than left-wing actors.",
      "But CSIS said its data has indicated a rise in violent activity by \"antifa extremists, anarchists and related far-left extremists,\" which it said is likely connected to the \"concurrent increase in violent far-right activity.\"",
      "What could Trump's suggested designation do?",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May 2020 that the U.S. would be designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization following nationwide unrest in response to the death of George Floyd,\" but nothing followed from that.",
      "Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the president does not have the authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, even if this were an \"organization.\"",
      "\"There is no legal mechanism that I'm aware of within U.S. code that would give the president or the federal government the power to declare a domestic 'group' as a major terrorist organization or a major terrorist group,\" he said.",
      "The administration could, however, shift antifa to a higher priority for federal law enforcement, Baumgartner said, which could lead to more frequent investigations or arrests.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security don't officially designate U.S. extremist groups as \"domestic terrorist organizations,\" in part because of First Amendment concerns, according to CRS.",
      "A 2023 report from the research entity also noted that the government does not provide a \"precise, comprehensive, and public explanation of any particular groups it might consider to be domestic terrorist organizations,\" and it warned that listing groups in that way may infringe on free speech rights or \"the act of belonging to an ideological group, which in and of itself is not a crime in the United States.\"",
      "\"At this point, it's not a crime in America to have 'leftist' political beliefs along the lines that some anti-fascists do,\" Kenney said.",
      "He added that designating groups as domestic terrorist organizations could also raise Fourth Amendment concerns regarding surveillance.",
      "\"Do we as Americans still enjoy the right to free speech, to nonviolent political expression of our views, however unpalatable the Trump administration might find those views? Yes,\" Kenney said.",
      "While the U.S. does not have a list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does have a Foreign Terrorist Organizations list. Among the groups on the list are Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS, which are known to operate transnationally. These groups are not related to the antifa movement.",
      "Kenney said that if the president were to try to designate antifa as a foreign terrorist organization, it would unlock tools like economic sanctions to bring greater pressure on the movement. Mr. Trump hasn't said he has this in mind, though he said he'd recommend \"those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated.\" A foreign terrorist designation, if it were possible, would make it a crime to provide material support to antifa. Making this designation would present other challenges, however.",
      "\"When the president refers to antifa, whether in remarks to reporters or speeches, he's usually referring to domestic non-state actors and domestic incidents, so how are they going to portray that as foreign? That's not clear to me,\" Kenney said.",
      "Can the Justice Department charge someone associated with antifa with domestic terrorism?",
      "No. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as \"violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\" But it is not a chargeable offense under federal law.",
      "\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.",
      "But there are numerous federal criminal statutes that could apply to domestic terrorism.",
      "In the case of Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, he was convicted of 33 counts of federal hate crimes, obstruction of religious exercise and firearms charges.",
      "Payton Gendron, who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, is facing federal hate crime and weapons charges. Gendron also pleaded guilty to a state terrorism charge.",
      "Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia criminalize the act of domestic terrorism, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law. In 21 states and D.C., it is a crime to provide support to further an act of terrorism or a terror.",
      "Harsher punishments a possibility",
      "But Baumgartner said that where alleged domestic terrorism does come into play at the federal level is in increased penalties for perpetrators. Prosecutors have sought harsher punishments for felony offenses that \"involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked federal judges in 2023 to apply a terrorism adjustment in cases involving members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right organizations whose members were convicted on charges stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, including seditious conspiracy.",
      "When ex-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was sentenced for multiple crimes related to the riot, prosecutors succeeded in applying the terrorism enhancement to his sentencing, although the judge did not allow it to heavily affect the length of the 22-year sentence. Mr. Trump issued Tarrio a full pardon upon taking office in January. He also commuted the sentences of members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.",

      "Schumer and Jeffries have repeatedly asked Republican leaders to negotiate with them on a short-term funding patch.

    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 20:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration announced it believes acetaminophen is linked to autism risk, but the maker of Tylenol and medical experts have strongly pushed back on the claims.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced the Food and Drug Administration believes the use of acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications \u2014 during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism, though medical experts have said the medication is safe.",
      "\"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,\" the president said. \"So, taking Tylenol is not good, alright? I'll say it. It's not good. For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.\"",
      "\"Ideally, a woman won't take Tylenol,\" he said, and pivoted to discussion of childhood vaccination, saying vaccines should be given in \"smaller doses\" and spread out \"over a period of years,\" without citing medical evidence for his claims about vaccines. On his various vaccine recommendations, the president said, \"You know, I'm just making these statements from me, I'm not making them from these doctors.\"",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the FDA based its decision on acetaminophen on \"clinical and laboratory studies\" that \"suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,\" including one study in the public health journal Environmental Health, but added that \"NIH [National Institutes of Health] research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses.\"",
      "However, in a major study published last year, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "After Mr. Trump's announcement, the FDA shared an open letter encouraging physicians to \"consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers\" \u2014 though the agency was more cautious than some of the president's statements.",
      "\"To be clear, while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,\" the letter states, calling the issue an \"ongoing area of scientific debate.\"",
      "The letter also stated physicians should balance the possible risks of acetaminophen with the fact that it is still safer than other over-the-counter painkillers and fever-reducing drugs during pregnancy, like aspirin and ibuprofen.",
      "The announcement comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS would undertake a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said later that month it could be as long as a year before the findings are released.",
      "\"To meet the president's challenge, I ordered HHS to launch unprecedented, all-agency effort to identify all causes of autism, including toxic and pharmaceutical exposures,\" Kennedy said.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary also announced FDA approval of the drug leucovorin to treat autism in children. It has previously been used off-label for that purpose.",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why. Most experts say it is likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in the way the condition is diagnosed.",
      "Tylenol maker responds to autism claims",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said \"independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.\"",
      "\"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise,\" the statement continues, highlighting what the company says is the greater health risk for expecting mothers from other conditions if they give up on taking the drug. \"Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\"",
      "\"The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,\" the company said, adding that it \"will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"",
      "Medical experts on acetaminophen and autism research",
      "In a statement to CBS News when reports of the administration's plans first surfaced, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said, \"There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",
      "Following the administration's announcement Monday, ACOG President Dr. Steven J. Fleischman said in a statement: \"Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy.\"",
      "\"Today's announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,\" Fleischman said. \"It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.\"",
      "\"The best evidence does not show an association between Tylenol and autism,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"The medical community, the scientific community has the same consensus, which is that Tylenol, acetaminophen, is safe in pregnancy.\"",
      "Gounder said acetaminophen is considered the safest option for treating issues like pain and high fever during pregnancy.",
      "\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" Gounder explained, adding she's worried that expectant mothers may turn to other options that would be less safe.",
      "\"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby,\" she said.",
      "While some previous research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have found no connection.",
      "\"Any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science and is premature given the current science,\" the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",
      "\"Scientific and medical authorities around the world recognize acetaminophen as the only analgesic considered safe for use during pregnancy when used according to the Drug Facts label, which specifically reminds pregnant women to always consult their healthcare provider before use,\" the group said.",
      "What is leucovorin?",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said autism \"may also be due to an autoimmune reaction to a folate receptor on the brain not allowing that important vitamin to get into the brain cells.\"",
      "He announced FDA approval of the drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid (also known as folate or vitamin B9), to treat autism in children. Leucovorin is an inexpensive, generic drug that was previously approved to ease the side effects of cancer chemotherapy.",
      "Pregnant women are prescribed multivitamins with folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. The neural tube develops into the brain and spinal cord.",
      "Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"You can have a perfectly normal folate level in your blood, but it may not be getting into the brain, and so there's a defect in the transport of folate into the brain. Leucovorin works around that,\" Gounder explained. \"Not all children with autism have this defect, so there's a test you can do to assess whether that's what's at play. For those kids, leucovorin has been shown to help, particularly with speech, getting kids to be more verbal than they were before.\"",
      "Leucovorin isn't a cure for autism, but \"it could really have a substantial impact on a very good percentage of children with autism,\" Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, told CBS News earlier this year.",

      "Kirk, who routinely debated progressive students at his Turning Point USA events and espoused controversial opinions on his podcast, was a stalwart proponent of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Hate speech does not exist legally in America,\" he wrote on X last year. \"There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.\"",
      "But over the last several days, the administration he supported and the president he helped reelect have vowed to crack down on some speech about his death.",
      "Last week, Pentagon officials promised to \"address\" federal employees who mock or celebrate Kirk's death. On Monday, the State Department said it will revoke visas\u00a0over social posts that \"celebrate\" Kirk's death.",
      "That same day, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's podcast and encouraged listeners to call the employers of anyone \"celebrating Charlie's murder.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday said people who post \"hate speech\" should be \"shut down\" and suggested that the Trump administration would pursue people who engage in hate speech.",
      "\"There's free speech, and then there's hate speech,\" Bondi said in an\u00a0interview. \"We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.\" The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld free speech rights, even if it is hate speech. She later said on X that \"hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected.\" The Justice Department referred CBS News to Bondi's comments when asked whether the administration considers celebrations of Kirk's assassination as threats of violence.",
      "\"Democrat critics are lying about the Administration's actions \u2014 this effort will target those committing criminal acts and hold them accountable,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Asked about Bondi's remarks, President Trump told ABC News' Jonathan Karl on Tuesday: \"We'll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly; it's hate.\"",
      "Kimmel \"indefinitely\" taken off air",
      "Late Wednesday, ABC announced it would \"indefinitely\" pre-empt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said the network should \"take action\" for the comedian's suggestion that Kirk's alleged killer is a Trump supporter. ABC's move came after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they were pulling the show indefinitely. Carr thanked Nexstar and Sinclair for taking action.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the FCC to approve it. Nexstar told CBS News in a statement it made the decision to pre-empt Kimmel \"unilaterally\" and did not consult with the FCC beforehand.",
      "On Truth Social, Mr. Trump referred to it as a cancellation and congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" and added: \"That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"",
      "Anna Gomez, one of two FCC commissioners working with Carr and the lone Democrat on the commission, called Kimmel's penalty a dangerous new precedent.",
      "\"This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power and reflects views they oppose,\" she said on CNN Wednesday.",
      "In a statement on Thursday, she added: \"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. \u2026 Free speech is the foundation of our democracy, and we must push back against any attempt to erode it.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also criticized the move.",
      "\"When the head of the FCC is talking openly about taking away the broadcast license, then that is the government trying to exercise censorship. It's not a question of whether you agree with Mr. Kimmel or disagree with Mr. Kimmel. The point is one of the government not coming in and making decisions about whose speech gets heard,\" she said, adding, \"Everyone should care, no matter what your political view is.\"",
      "After nearly a week of controversy, Disney said Kimmel's show would return on Tuesday, Sept. 23. The company said some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive,\" but after several days of \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy ... we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.\"",
      "The First Amendment and hateful speech",
      "In general, the First Amendment \u2014 which bars the government from \"abridging the freedom of speech\" \u2014 protects most forms of hateful speech, aside from a narrow set of exceptions that include threats of violence and incitement.",
      "Bondi's initial comments about hate speech stood out among those made by administration officials because of her position as the nation's top prosecutor, said Adam Goldstein, vice president of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "\"I especially don't want to see an attorney in charge of the Justice Department saying that,\" he said. \"It's the kind of thing that would get you a bad grade in your constitutional law class.\"",
      "Jenin Younes, a First Amendment attorney who worked on a case accusing the Biden administration of social media censorship, told CBS News, \"These are all the same people who were railing against cancel culture and the idea of hate speech just a few years ago, when it was the left doing it.\"",
      "\"The worry is that lawmakers will just define hate speech to mean anything the opposite party says, and so that's why the court has said it's not up to the government to decide what's within the bounds of acceptable discourse and what's not,\" Genevieve Lakier, a University of Chicago law professor, told CBS News. \"There's no definition of hate speech, because the whole point is there's no neutral definition of hate speech.\"",
      "In most cases, Lakier said, \"simply saying 'he had it coming' \u2026 does not fit the very, very, very narrow definition of incitement that is available in the case law.\"",
      "Are offensive comments illegal?",
      "First Amendment legal scholar Eugene Volokh told CBS News that, in most circumstances, the government cannot go after ordinary people for making insensitive or offensive public comments about Kirk's killing.",
      "\"It may be in bad taste. It may be bad for the country when people are trying to normalize political violence. But it is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Volokh, a professor emeritus of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\"I would say it's basically prohibited for the government to say you can't mock or make fun of or even celebrate his death,\" said Younes, who currently serves as national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.",
      "Volokh says comments like Bondi's \"are likely to further confuse people, whether citizens or law enforcement or others, about what's protected and what's not protected.\"",
      "\"I think they may also kind of send a message that we are going to try to find a way of punishing this speech,\" Volokh added.",
      "Bondi also said Monday the Justice Department could prosecute businesses that refuse to print photos of Kirk for customers, citing a worker at an Office Depot who declined to print flyers for a Kirk vigil. Office Depot called the incident \"completely unacceptable\" and said the staff member no longer works for the company.",
      "\"There is no federal law that prohibits copy shops or print shops from discriminating based on the content of the message,\" Volokh said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Bondi was solely referencing the Office Depot incident, which the department's civil rights division looked into.",
      "Less clear, according to legal experts, is whether the federal government can deport non-citizens or revoke their visas over their views on Kirk, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has floated. Volokh says the laws around this are \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"While it is true that the executive's power when it comes to immigration is very vast, I think the First Amendment constrains it,\" Younes said. She pointed to the Trump administration's attempts to remove students for participating in pro-Palestinian protests, which have been met with pushback at the district court level.",
      "What can private companies do?",
      "The First Amendment doesn't stop private employers from choosing to fire people for speech, though some states like California have their own legal protections.",
      "However, in some cases, it can be illegal for the government to use its power to pressure a private company into firing a staff member \u2014 a concept known as \"jawboning.\"",
      "Government officials can try to persuade private companies to take a certain action, according to Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, but they cannot coerce companies by making threats.",
      "Volokh said it likely doesn't qualify as jawboning if elected officials merely express the view that people should be fired, as long as they don't cross the line into threatening to take action. For example, on Vance's call for people to contact the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's death, Volokh said, \"it's hard to see that as unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"You would have to show the private employer didn't want to fire you, but they were just acting because they were afraid of some kind of repercussions from the government,\" noted Younes.",
      "There's a fine line between broadly encouraging companies to fire employees who praised Kirk's assassination, and giving instructions to specific firms, according to Goldstein. He pointed to a contrast between Vance's comments advising podcasts listeners to call people's employers, and a tweet by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Duffy praised American Airlines, United and Delta for suspending employees, and wrote, \"The next step should be to fire them.\"",
      "\"A rational airline who sees this message might feel some coercive effect on their decision making,\" said Goldstein, noting Duffy's power over the airline industry.",
      "Lakier said it's not a violation of the First Amendment if a company fires an employee of their own volition. But, she said, \"the problem is, in many of these cases, it's going to be because of political sympathy.\"",
      "\"The employers who are firing them, maybe implicitly fear that if they don't, they're going to face the government's wrath or they want to curry favor by firing,\" she said.",
      "In general, however, \"If we're talking about private companies and you are an at-will employee, then that means exactly as it sounds like, which is that an employer can fire you at will,\" said CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.",
      "Government workers have some free speech protections, but it's complicated",
      "In many cases, Trump allies have spotlighted public employees who criticize Kirk.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called celebrations of Kirk's death by service members or civilian workers \"unacceptable\" last week, and said the Pentagon is \"tracking\" them. Since then, at least one Marine officer has been relieved of his recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post about Kirk, and two Army officers have been suspended pending a review into their posts, according to a Marine official and an Army official.",
      "A Secret Service agent who expressed negative opinions about Kirk on Facebook was also placed on leave last week.",
      "At the state level, Oklahoma's top education official has said teachers who celebrate Kirk's assassination \"will be banned from teaching,\" and teachers in several other states have been investigated or placed on leave over their comments. Others have pushed for action against employees at public colleges like Clemson University.",
      "People who work for the government have some free speech protections, especially for speech that they make while off the clock, legal experts say.",
      "\"Government employees do have First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,\" said Calvert. \"However, those rights are not unlimited and may be restricted if the employee's speech somehow interferes with the ability of the employer \u2026 to effectively and efficiently deliver its services to the public.\"",
      "Calvert said \"every case is going to be unique.\"",
      "Prior court rulings have established several factors for assessing the speech rights of government employees, according to Calvert and Volokh. Those include whether the worker spoke in their personal capacity, whether it relates to a matter of public concern and whether the worker's right to speak out outweighs the government's interest in delivering its services.",
      "But the military is a slightly separate case, according to Volokh, because \"there are more restrictions that are permissible on service members' speech.\"",
      "Volokh said the military is different \"in part because of a sense that \u2026 this is an environment where discipline is really important, where self-discipline is really important, where unit cohesion is really important, where commitment to the right ideas is very important.\"",
      "\"It's going very, very far\"",
      "Some First Amendment advocates are uncomfortable with vocal calls for people to be fired \u2014 even if they don't run afoul of the Constitution.",
      "\"It's going very, very far. This is not being limited to people saying, 'I'm glad Charlie Kirk is dead and I wish everyone like him was dead, too,'\" Younes said. \"It's being applied to people who just are saying they didn't like Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Goldstein said that some officials may be understandably lashing out after the death of their friend, but particularly in the context of Kirk's career as free speech advocate, the reaction has gone too far.",
      "\"What a weird way to react in memory of Charlie Kirk, who was known for listening to people and disagreeing with them, and moving on,\" Goldstein said.",
      "Graham  Kates, \n                                                  \n                                  Eleanor  Watson, \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",
      "\"All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,\" he said.",
      "The discovery comes just a few months after\u00a0 scientists identified the Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, a new T. rex ancestor that researchers called the \"missing link\" between apex predators.",

      "Vibrio vulnificus is a bacteria that occurs in warm coastal waters, CBS News previously reported, and is more common between May and October. It can cause illness including life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis, according to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About one in five people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, according to the CDC.",
      "It's not clear how the person contracted the bacteria. The person was not identified in a news release from state health officials.",
      "People can contract the bacteria by exposing an open wound to contaminated water or by eating raw or undercooked seafood, including oysters. Two of the Vibrio vulnificus deaths in Louisiana this year were in people who ate contaminated raw oysters, the state health department said in August.",
      "Louisiana and other states have been seeing an increase in Vibrio vulnificus diagnoses. Experts suggest the trend may be because of\u00a0warming oceans. The bacteria is usually found in the Gulf Coast, but has begun to become more common further north, said Dr. Fred Lopez, an infectious disease specialist at LSU Health.",

      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",
      "\"It was a different kind of forest,\" said Herrera.",
      "The amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.",

    "summary": "The capture by the International Space Station's robot arm came a day late because of an unexpected, but now resolved, software issue.",
    "story": [
      "Running a day late because of software issues, Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship caught up with the International Space Station early Thursday and then stood by while the lab's robot arm latched on to a grapple fixture to wrap up a successful, if extended, rendezvous.",
      "The capture came after Northrop Grumman engineers adjusted the sensitivity of the main engine fault detection software that prematurely triggered shutdowns during two rendezvous thruster firings Tuesday.",
      "As it turned out, the main engine was healthy all along and once the software was adjusted, the spacecraft was able to press ahead with the rendezvous, pulling up to a point just below the station so robot arm operator Jonny Kim, assisted by Zena Cardman, could capture the ship.",
      "\"A big congratulations to the NASA and Cygnus teams for a successful Cygnus launch, rendezvous and capture,\" Kim radioed mission control. \"Adapting and overcoming unforeseen challenges is something we do at NASA, and I'm very proud to be a part of this team.\"",
      "Unlike SpaceX's cargo Dragon and Russian Progress freighters, which carry out autonomous dockings at their respective ports, the Cygnus was designed to be captured by the station's arm and pulled in for berthing.",
      "After locking onto the Cygnus XL at 7:24 a.m. EDT, Kim handed off arm operations to flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston so the ship could be pulled in for berthing at the Earth-facing port of the central Unity module.",
      "Northrop Grumman names its cargo ships after notable figures in the space community. The Cygnus XL was named in honor of shuttle pilot William \"Willie\" McCool, who lost his life in the 2003 Columbia disaster.",
      "Space station astronaut Mike Fincke, a member of the 1996 astronaut class along with McCool, said he was \"a gifted pilot, a devoted crewmate and a man of deep humility, his life continues to inspire us.\"",
      "\"To see a ship bearing his name safely arrive at the station is a reminder that his courage and kindness are still circling our beautiful planet Earth,\" he said.",
      "On board: more than 5 tons of needed spare parts, research material and crew supplies, including holiday treats for the station crew.",
      "\"The (Cygnus) is packed with consumables, like nitrogen, oxygen, food and toilet parts, and it has a large number of spare parts that are required for systems like, for example, our urine processor,\" said Dina Contella, deputy manager of the space station program at the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"We're stocking up on these items since we were short over the past year, and we'd like to have a good reserve for the future,\" she said.",
      "That shortfall was caused, in part, by damage an earlier Cygnus suffered during shipment from a subcontractor in Europe to Cape Canaveral, Florida. That vehicle is still grounded pending analysis and repairs.",
      "Sunday's launch of the Cygnus XL marked the maiden flight of an upgraded version of the cargo ship, which is about 5 feet longer than the original, allowing it to carry about 2,600 pounds of additional cargo.",
      "NASA pays for cargo delivery flights using Cygnus and Dragon spacecraft. To date, SpaceX has successfully carried out 32 Dragon resupply missions while Northrop Grumman has executed 21 successful flights, including the current mission.",
      "Bill Spetch, operations integration manager for the space station, said the resupply flights \"and especially this great capability that Cygnus brings and the amount of cargo that it brings to us, is critical for us to keep us running smooth and doing the things that we need ... to do the research.\"",

In total, law enforcement discovered 300 SIM servers \u2013 over 100,000 SIM cards \u2013 enabling encrypted, anonymous communication and capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. Officials say the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch.",

      "An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that this week, the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes,\" later adding, \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "Telephonic threats to multiple senior U.S. officials this past spring \u2013 including multiple people protected by the Secret Service \u2013 first triggered the investigation, but officials say the network was seized within the last three weeks.",
      "\"We cannot share which officials were targeted out of concerns for their privacy, but as the forensics investigation continues, we do expect that we will find more targeted officials once we get through that data,\" McCool said.",
      "Early analysis shows the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement, including members of known organized crime gangs, drug cartels and human trafficking rings, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. The U.S. Secret Service says it is combing through the more than 100,000 SIM cards in an ongoing, exhaustive forensic analysis.",
      "\"Each SIM basically has the equivalent data of a cell phone. So we're working through every call, every text, every search made on those SIM cards,\" an official told CBS News, adding, \"Early analysis indicates that this network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement here in the U.S.\"",
      "The equipment was found within 35 miles of the United Nations in New York, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. Investigators also found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, plus computers and phones.",
      "\"This isn't a group of people in a basement playing a video game and trying to play a prank,\" one official said. \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "\"The timing, the location, the proximity of this network had the potential to impact the U.N. and that was clear and something that we had to consider,\" added McCool.",
      "The investigation was launched by a new division within the U.S. Secret Service established by Director Sean Curran and dubbed the \"Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit,\" in conjunction with Homeland Security Investigations.",
      "\"These devices no longer pose any threat to New York,\" an official said. \"We've taken care of and dismantled that threat\u2026There is currently no credible threat against the UN.\"",

      "The investigation remains ongoing, according to the U.S. Secret Service.

      "Robot umpires are getting called up to the big leagues next season.",
      "Major League Baseball's 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026.",
      "Human plate umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams can challenge two calls per game and get additional appeals in extra innings. Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter \u2014 signaled by tapping their helmet or cap \u2014 and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.",
      "Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.",
      "Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.",
      "The Automated Ball-Strike Challenge System, powered by T-Mobile, is coming to MLB's Regular Season \u26be\ufe0f https://t.co/97raRHFtsT pic.twitter.com/SHxKuRTKu8",
      "ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that year's Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "In 2019, Fred DeJesus became the first umpire in a regular-season game to use ABS. He remembers the first pitch he tested \u2013 it was a strike \u2013 and how he was hesitant about the new technology at first.",
      "\"Initially, it was like, no way, we're not doing this. I spent way too much money trying to learn the craft of calling balls and strikes,\" he told CBS News in 2021.",
      "At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.",
      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.",
      "At Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.",
      "ABS was used in this year's All-Star Game as well and has generally received positive reviews, CBS Sports reported. Four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna's calls were successful in July.",
      "Teams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. However, the proposal approved by the MLB on Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don't have challenges remaining.",
      "MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",
      "This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, restrictions on defensive shifts, pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts and larger bases.",
      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers. While there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, not everyone considers the skill a good thing.",
      "\"The idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that's not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension,\" former manager Bobby Valentine said.",
      "Texas manager Bruce Bochy, a big league catcher from 1978-87, maintained old-school umpires such as Bruce Froemming and Billy Williams never would have accepted pitch framing.

    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

    "story": [
      "Emeline Lakrout, a busy New Yorker with a knack for running, rock climbing and swimming, doesn't let being legally blind stop her from living an active lifestyle.",
      "Despite being declared blind at 8 years old, Lakrout has taken on challenges, such as running the New York City Marathon and joining the U.S. National Paraclimbing Team. A new piece of technology \u2014 Meta's AI glasses \u2014 is her latest tool to help her stay savvy and adaptable on a daily basis.",
      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",
      "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the technology.",
      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",
      "The glasses, however, are work in progress says Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind.",
      "\"(They) work well for some things, doesn't work well in other situations,\" he said.",
      "Lakrout discovered this for herself. When she tried the glasses on in a restaurant, they read the menu to her perfectly but couldn't tell her the price for a specific item on second prompt. When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

      "The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company.

      "This story is a CBS News collaboration with The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million of federal grants for animal testing as major federal health agencies are phasing out research on live animals in favor of new alternatives, a joint investigation by CBS News and The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, has found.",
      "\"We're witnessing a watershed moment right now,\" said Justin Goodman, the senior vice president of White Coat Waste, an animal rights nonprofit. \"We have an administration that's skeptical of spending, skeptical of establishment science. \u2026 We are trying to slash and burn as much animal testing funding as possible.\"",
      "The pressure for change comes from an unlikely coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress who want to halt what animal rights groups estimate as $20 billion a year in federal spending for animal experiments. Long considered a cause of the left, the animal rights movement has expanded and gained steam under the Trump administration. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is leading the charge against high drug costs, vaccine safety and the grinding approval process required to bring innovations to market.",
      "Animal tests, often involving painful experiments that end in euthanasia, have played a crucial role in developing novel vaccines for COVID-19, malaria, polio and popular medications such as Tylenol and Ozempic, which ushered in a craze for weight-loss drugs.",
      "\"In conventional medicine, those procedures, those diagnostics, those therapeutics, for the most part, were discovered in animals,\" said Steven Marks, the dean of the veterinary school at Clemson University. \"But they're changing the landscape of human health right now.\"",
      "No one knows where it will end.",
      "Since President Trump took office, all major federal health agencies have promised to phase out animal research, with varying degrees of effectiveness. The Veterans Administration says it is on track, as promised, to end all primate research that's been used to develop new treatments for neurological disorders, alcoholism and mental problems.",
      "The sprawling National Institutes of Health has agreed to phase out experiments with dogs, cats and primates, but watchdogs have found recent examples of the agency launching new animal research. Federal money has continued to flow to incomplete research projects and to contractors who breed and care for thousands of animals bound for laboratories.",
      "The effort has sparked uncertainty in South Carolina, where a research company maintains a free-ranging monkey colony on secluded Morgan Island, where nearly 4,000 federally owned rhesus monkeys bask in the sun until they are shipped off to federal laboratories.",
      "U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Charleston Republican, has been a leader in the animal rights fight, joined by White Coat Waste, a group that counts billionaire Elon Musk among its supporters. Mace has introduced legislation to end federally funded animal research. She also recently inserted language in a House spending bill to force the NIH to justify continued spending on Morgan Island, which is more popularly known as \"Monkey Island.\"",
      "\"Honestly, it's heartbreaking,\" Goodman told CBS News and The Post and Courier on a recent visit to waters surrounding the island.",
      "As Goodman watched, rhesus mothers and babies romped on the island's sandy beach and stared down from palmetto trees. But each year, hundreds are \"taken from this wild habitat with their friends, with their families and shipped to laboratories. They're gonna be socially isolated in tiny cages by themselves and subjected to some of the most barbaric painful experiments you can imagine,\" he said.",
      "His group's mission, Goodman said, is to \"slash as much animal funding as possible.\"",
      "Patients who stand to benefit from continued animal research hang in the balance. Animal experiments have helped develop breakthrough drugs, like the immunotherapy that's saving the life of 11-month-old Max Harbin of Folly Beach, South Carolina. Max has a spinal condition that once ranked as the leading genetic cause of infant deaths.",
      "Before Max's therapy was approved for pediatric use in 2019, it went through years of studies with mice and monkeys. A Food and Drug Administration official described the therapy as a way to \"change the lives of those patients who may have faced a terminal condition.\"",
      "Max's mother Laura, an animal lover, said she was unaware of the rigorous animal experiments that led to human approval for Zolgensma, a single-dose therapy made by Novartis.",
      "\"It's odd to think that it's a step in the process, but it's a necessary one, and without it, my son would be in a very, very different place. I'm definitely grateful there's a way to test it so we know it's safe.\"",
      "Now, the FDA is now among the agencies promising to make a \"paradigm shift\" in how new drugs are approved.",
      "It wants to use new techniques like AI-based computational modeling, lab testing on human organs and data analysis to \"get safer treatments to patients faster and more reliably while also reducing R&D costs and drug prices,\" said FDA commissioner Martin Makary. \"It is a win-win for public health and ethics.\"",
      "There's still a major hurdle with phasing out all federal animal research. The science behind alternatives is rapidly evolving, but many experts say it's not yet ready to serve as the only gauge of safety and effectiveness in humans.",
      "\"I want to see us get out of the business of using animals in research,\" said Paul Locke, who is an environmental health lawyer at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and serves on the board of the school's Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing. \"The question is when. When can we do that and reach the double goal of having better science and virtually no animals? The answer is not tomorrow.\"",
      "Locke testified this year at a congressional hearing organized by Mace about the need for federal agencies to step up in support of alternative research and \"set the global standards in these fields.\"",
      "The hearing won more attention, including supportive social media posts from President Trump, about Mace's charge that the federal government spent more than $10 million to create transgender mice and other animals and study their behaviors.",
      "Parents like Justin and Rosalyn Porcano in San Rafael, California, are watching the debate with concern. Their 7-year-old daughter Lia has a rare genetic disorder, Usher Syndrome 1B. She was born deaf and is facing blindness, with no treatments currently available. Without medical advancements in treatment of the disorder, she will likely go blind by the time she's in high school.",

      "Routh was arrested in September 2024 at Mr. Trump's golf course. A Secret Service agent testified last week that he spotted Routh before the then-presidential candidate came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot, the agent said.",

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the guilty verdict against Routh \"illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence,\" and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the verdict sends \"a clear message\" that an \"attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate is an attack on our Republic and on the rights of every citizen.\"",
      "A federal district judge will determine his sentence. He faces life in prison.",
      "In a nearly hourlong closing argument on Tuesday, Routh said that there was no intent to kill because the trigger was never pulled, the gun was never fired and that no one was hurt, so \"no crime.\"",
      "\"I wanted to kill, my actions within the community and toward my co-workers and family should show my obvious non-violence and gentleness,\" Routh said. Speaking about himself in the third person, he said the shooting was never going to happen because it was \"never in his heart.\"",
      "But prosecutors said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Mr. Trump, who was then running for president. Prosecutors laid out Routh's actions ahead of the incident, saying \"those aren'tcoincidences \u2026 that's a plan,\" prosecutor Christopher Brown said in his closing argument.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 14:27:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Government scientists say infection rates from drug-resistant \"nightmare bacteria\" have been increasing dramatically.",
    "story": [
      "Infection rates from drug-resistant \"nightmare bacteria\" rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.",
      "Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in an article published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said.",
      "Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.",
      "\"The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,\" said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.",
      "It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.",
      "That may play out in doctors' offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat \u2014 like urinary tract infections \u2014 could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report's authors.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise \u2014 unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn't kill the germs made them stronger.",
      "In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to \"nightmare bacteria\" resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.",
      "Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.",
      "They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.",
      "The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 \u2014 an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 \u2014 an increase of 460%, the authors said.",
      "A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,\" said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.",
      "The CDC's count is only a partial picture.",
      "Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren't able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.",
      "The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections \"is definitely underestimated,\" Burnham said.",
      "This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC report published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024.",

    "story": [
      "For 25 years,\u00a0Bill Gates\u00a0says the world has seen what he calls \"miraculous\" progress. He told \"CBS Mornings\" that annual child deaths have dropped globally from more than 10 million to fewer than 5 million.",
      "But now, he warns, 2025 could mark the first year in decades when more children die than the year before.",
      "\"We shouldn't have this be the first year that more children die than the year before,\" Gates told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We should continue the progress that Americans should be very proud of.\"",
      "Gates delivered the warning as he announced a $912 million pledge over three years to fight infectious diseases worldwide, calling this moment a crossroads that will test whether the U.S. continues its role in saving lives.",
      "The Microsoft co-founder pointed to breakthrough innovations \u2014 from AI-driven tools that prevent HIV infections to new methods of eliminating malaria-carrying mosquitoes \u2014 but cautioned that progress will stall without sustained funding. At stake, he said, is whether the U.S. will continue devoting roughly 1% of its budget to global health, an investment that has delivered unprecedented results.",
      "\"If we just maintain that modest level, because of the great innovations and incredible people in the field doing this work, we can cut it in half again,\" Gates said.",
      "He recently testified before the Senate about the consequences of cutting foreign health aid. The Trump administration has already reduced funding, and delayed payments have fueled rising debts. Gates said he has spoken directly with President Trump about the issue but admitted future funding levels remain uncertain.",
      "\"Well, there have been a lot of payments that aren't being made right now, and so we are seeing debts go up,\" he said. \"The big question is, when they set the new budget, what level will it be set at, and will that money actually be sent out? This is a great time that the Congress gets to show its sense of values to continue the fight against polio, to make sure mothers get the nutrition they need.\"",
      "Gates, who plans to give away nearly all of his wealth within the next 20 years, stressed that the 1% investment produces outsized benefits. It supports disease detection systems that can identify pandemics before they reach the U.S. and helps poorer nations stabilize, grow their economies, and join the global marketplace.",
      "Faith leaders have also framed the issue as a moral imperative, Gates added, noting that the other 99% of the federal budget remains dedicated to domestic priorities.",
      "\"When you say American first, can you still have the charity for that 1%?\" he asked.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 17:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump administration figures have vowed to pursue anyone who mocks or celebrates Kirk's death, alarming First Amendment advocates.",
    "story": [
      "In the week since conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated at a Utah university event, comments from some of his critics have ignited a battle over free speech in an increasingly polarized nation.",
      "Kirk, who routinely debated progressive students at his Turning Point USA events and espoused controversial opinions on his podcast, was a stalwart proponent of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Hate speech does not exist legally in America,\" he wrote on X last year. \"There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.\"",
      "But over the last several days, the administration he supported and the president he helped reelect have vowed to crack down on some speech about his death.",
      "Last week, Pentagon officials promised to \"address\" federal employees who mock or celebrate Kirk's death. On Monday, the State Department said it will revoke visas\u00a0over social posts that \"celebrate\" Kirk's death.",
      "That same day, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's podcast and encouraged listeners to call the employers of anyone \"celebrating Charlie's murder.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday said people who post \"hate speech\" should be \"shut down\" and suggested that the Trump administration would pursue people who engage in hate speech.",
      "\"There's free speech, and then there's hate speech,\" Bondi said in an\u00a0interview. \"We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.\" The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld free speech rights, even if it is hate speech. She later said on X that \"hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected.\" The Justice Department referred CBS News to Bondi's comments when asked whether the administration considers celebrations of Kirk's assassination as threats of violence.",
      "\"Democrat critics are lying about the Administration's actions \u2014 this effort will target those committing criminal acts and hold them accountable,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Asked about Bondi's remarks, President Trump told ABC News' Jonathan Karl on Tuesday: \"We'll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly; it's hate.\"",
      "Kimmel \"indefinitely\" taken off air",
      "Late Wednesday, ABC announced it would \"indefinitely\" pre-empt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said the network should \"take action\" for the comedian's suggestion that Kirk's alleged killer is a Trump supporter. ABC's move came after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they were pulling the show indefinitely. Carr thanked Nexstar and Sinclair for taking action.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the FCC to approve it. Nexstar told CBS News in a statement it made the decision to pre-empt Kimmel \"unilaterally\" and did not consult with the FCC beforehand.",
      "On Truth Social, Mr. Trump referred to it as a cancellation and congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" and added: \"That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"",
      "Anna Gomez, one of two FCC commissioners working with Carr and the lone Democrat on the commission, called Kimmel's penalty a dangerous new precedent.",
      "\"This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power and reflects views they oppose,\" she said on CNN Wednesday.",
      "In a statement on Thursday, she added: \"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. \u2026 Free speech is the foundation of our democracy, and we must push back against any attempt to erode it.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also criticized the move.",
      "\"When the head of the FCC is talking openly about taking away the broadcast license, then that is the government trying to exercise censorship. It's not a question of whether you agree with Mr. Kimmel or disagree with Mr. Kimmel. The point is one of the government not coming in and making decisions about whose speech gets heard,\" she said, adding, \"Everyone should care, no matter what your political view is.\"",
      "After nearly a week of controversy, Disney said Kimmel's show would return on Tuesday, Sept. 23. The company said some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive,\" but after several days of \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy ... we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.\"",
      "The First Amendment and hateful speech",
      "In general, the First Amendment \u2014 which bars the government from \"abridging the freedom of speech\" \u2014 protects most forms of hateful speech, aside from a narrow set of exceptions that include threats of violence and incitement.",
      "Bondi's initial comments about hate speech stood out among those made by administration officials because of her position as the nation's top prosecutor, said Adam Goldstein, vice president of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "\"I especially don't want to see an attorney in charge of the Justice Department saying that,\" he said. \"It's the kind of thing that would get you a bad grade in your constitutional law class.\"",
      "Jenin Younes, a First Amendment attorney who worked on a case accusing the Biden administration of social media censorship, told CBS News, \"These are all the same people who were railing against cancel culture and the idea of hate speech just a few years ago, when it was the left doing it.\"",
      "\"The worry is that lawmakers will just define hate speech to mean anything the opposite party says, and so that's why the court has said it's not up to the government to decide what's within the bounds of acceptable discourse and what's not,\" Genevieve Lakier, a University of Chicago law professor, told CBS News. \"There's no definition of hate speech, because the whole point is there's no neutral definition of hate speech.\"",
      "In most cases, Lakier said, \"simply saying 'he had it coming' \u2026 does not fit the very, very, very narrow definition of incitement that is available in the case law.\"",
      "Are offensive comments illegal?",
      "First Amendment legal scholar Eugene Volokh told CBS News that, in most circumstances, the government cannot go after ordinary people for making insensitive or offensive public comments about Kirk's killing.",
      "\"It may be in bad taste. It may be bad for the country when people are trying to normalize political violence. But it is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Volokh, a professor emeritus of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\"I would say it's basically prohibited for the government to say you can't mock or make fun of or even celebrate his death,\" said Younes, who currently serves as national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.",
      "Volokh says comments like Bondi's \"are likely to further confuse people, whether citizens or law enforcement or others, about what's protected and what's not protected.\"",
      "\"I think they may also kind of send a message that we are going to try to find a way of punishing this speech,\" Volokh added.",
      "Bondi also said Monday the Justice Department could prosecute businesses that refuse to print photos of Kirk for customers, citing a worker at an Office Depot who declined to print flyers for a Kirk vigil. Office Depot called the incident \"completely unacceptable\" and said the staff member no longer works for the company.",
      "\"There is no federal law that prohibits copy shops or print shops from discriminating based on the content of the message,\" Volokh said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Bondi was solely referencing the Office Depot incident, which the department's civil rights division looked into.",
      "Less clear, according to legal experts, is whether the federal government can deport non-citizens or revoke their visas over their views on Kirk, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has floated. Volokh says the laws around this are \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"While it is true that the executive's power when it comes to immigration is very vast, I think the First Amendment constrains it,\" Younes said. She pointed to the Trump administration's attempts to remove students for participating in pro-Palestinian protests, which have been met with pushback at the district court level.",
      "What can private companies do?",
      "The First Amendment doesn't stop private employers from choosing to fire people for speech, though some states like California have their own legal protections.",
      "However, in some cases, it can be illegal for the government to use its power to pressure a private company into firing a staff member \u2014 a concept known as \"jawboning.\"",
      "Government officials can try to persuade private companies to take a certain action, according to Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, but they cannot coerce companies by making threats.",
      "Volokh said it likely doesn't qualify as jawboning if elected officials merely express the view that people should be fired, as long as they don't cross the line into threatening to take action. For example, on Vance's call for people to contact the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's death, Volokh said, \"it's hard to see that as unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"You would have to show the private employer didn't want to fire you, but they were just acting because they were afraid of some kind of repercussions from the government,\" noted Younes.",
      "There's a fine line between broadly encouraging companies to fire employees who praised Kirk's assassination, and giving instructions to specific firms, according to Goldstein. He pointed to a contrast between Vance's comments advising podcasts listeners to call people's employers, and a tweet by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Duffy praised American Airlines, United and Delta for suspending employees, and wrote, \"The next step should be to fire them.\"",
      "\"A rational airline who sees this message might feel some coercive effect on their decision making,\" said Goldstein, noting Duffy's power over the airline industry.",
      "Lakier said it's not a violation of the First Amendment if a company fires an employee of their own volition. But, she said, \"the problem is, in many of these cases, it's going to be because of political sympathy.\"",
      "\"The employers who are firing them, maybe implicitly fear that if they don't, they're going to face the government's wrath or they want to curry favor by firing,\" she said.",
      "In general, however, \"If we're talking about private companies and you are an at-will employee, then that means exactly as it sounds like, which is that an employer can fire you at will,\" said CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.",
      "Government workers have some free speech protections, but it's complicated",
      "In many cases, Trump allies have spotlighted public employees who criticize Kirk.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called celebrations of Kirk's death by service members or civilian workers \"unacceptable\" last week, and said the Pentagon is \"tracking\" them. Since then, at least one Marine officer has been relieved of his recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post about Kirk, and two Army officers have been suspended pending a review into their posts, according to a Marine official and an Army official.",
      "A Secret Service agent who expressed negative opinions about Kirk on Facebook was also placed on leave last week.",
      "At the state level, Oklahoma's top education official has said teachers who celebrate Kirk's assassination \"will be banned from teaching,\" and teachers in several other states have been investigated or placed on leave over their comments. Others have pushed for action against employees at public colleges like Clemson University.",
      "People who work for the government have some free speech protections, especially for speech that they make while off the clock, legal experts say.",
      "\"Government employees do have First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,\" said Calvert. \"However, those rights are not unlimited and may be restricted if the employee's speech somehow interferes with the ability of the employer \u2026 to effectively and efficiently deliver its services to the public.\"",
      "Calvert said \"every case is going to be unique.\"",
      "Prior court rulings have established several factors for assessing the speech rights of government employees, according to Calvert and Volokh. Those include whether the worker spoke in their personal capacity, whether it relates to a matter of public concern and whether the worker's right to speak out outweighs the government's interest in delivering its services.",
      "But the military is a slightly separate case, according to Volokh, because \"there are more restrictions that are permissible on service members' speech.\"",
      "Volokh said the military is different \"in part because of a sense that \u2026 this is an environment where discipline is really important, where self-discipline is really important, where unit cohesion is really important, where commitment to the right ideas is very important.\"",
      "\"It's going very, very far\"",
      "Some First Amendment advocates are uncomfortable with vocal calls for people to be fired \u2014 even if they don't run afoul of the Constitution.",
      "\"It's going very, very far. This is not being limited to people saying, 'I'm glad Charlie Kirk is dead and I wish everyone like him was dead, too,'\" Younes said. \"It's being applied to people who just are saying they didn't like Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Goldstein said that some officials may be understandably lashing out after the death of their friend, but particularly in the context of Kirk's career as free speech advocate, the reaction has gone too far.",
      "\"What a weird way to react in memory of Charlie Kirk, who was known for listening to people and disagreeing with them, and moving on,\" Goldstein said.",
      "Graham  Kates, \n                                                  \n                                  Eleanor  Watson, \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday he was surprised by President Trump's post arguing the Eastern European country could regain all of its territory captured by Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that Zelenskyy's forces are \"in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form\" with Europe's help.\u00a0 The unexpected remarks \u2014 which called the Russian military a \"paper tiger\" \u2014 came after Mr. Trump met with Zelenskyy for about an hour Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.",
      "The comments appear to mark a dramatic shift for Mr. Trump, who said last month he expected \"some swapping of territories\" as part of an eventual Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal. Russia occupies large parts of eastern Ukraine, including territories captured in 2014 and in the current war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Asked later Tuesday by Fox News' Bret Baier if he was surprised by the U.S. president's about-face, Zelenskyy laughed and responded, \"a little bit.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said he and Mr. Trump had a positive conversation on Tuesday, and he believes Mr. Trump's position on territorial swaps has changed.",
      "\"I think he understands for today that we can't just swap territories. It's not fair,\" he said.",
      "During their meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that Zelenskyy was \"putting up one hell of a fight,\" and he believes the \"biggest progress\" is that the Russian economy is \"terrible.\" But the U.S. leader didn't appear optimistic about a quick resolution to the war, telling reporters, \"It looks like it's not going to end for a long time.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire deal to end their more than three-year-long war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "But a deal has remained elusive as both sides' public positions remain far apart. The Kremlin has pushed Zelenskyy to fully withdraw from large swaths of eastern Ukraine, an idea Zelenskyy has rejected as unfair and unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Ukraine has sought international security guarantees to deter another Russian attack if the current conflict ends.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin at various points. He met with Putin in Alaska last month, but he has criticized the Russian leader for continued strikes on Ukraine, and said last week that Putin had \"really let me down.\"",
      "The U.S. president also pressed NATO countries earlier this month to stop buying Russian oil and to impose hefty tariffs on China, which has remained aligned with Russia, writing that those moves could \"be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.\"",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he believes NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace, after Russian drones entered Poland earlier this month and Russian fighter jets allegedly entered Estonian airspace.",
      "At other points, though, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy have had a rocky relationship. An Oval Office meeting between the two leaders earlier this year descended into a shouting match, and Mr. Trump has occasionally blamed Zelenskyy for the war.",
      "During his interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he believes his relationship with his American counterpart has improved.",
      "\"I think we have better relation[s] than before,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I think we didn't have close relation[s] because we didn't have, maybe, time. I don't know.\"",

      "\"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,\" President Trump said at a news conference with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the European Union's European Medicines Agency said there is currently \"no new evidence\" that would require changes to the current EU recommendations for use of acetaminophen, also commonly called paracetamol outside the U.S.",
      "\"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,\" Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. \"Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.\"",
      "The United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said Tuesday, \"taking paracetamol during pregnancy remains safe.\"",
      "\"There is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children,\" the agency's chief safety officer Dr. Alison Cave said in the statement.",
      "In a combined statement, Australia's chief medical officer and the country's medicine regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, said they were joining \"other global medicines regulators, leading clinicians and scientists worldwide in rejecting claims regarding the use of paracetamol in pregnancy, and the subsequent risk of development of ADHD or autism in children.\"",
      "\"Robust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims,\" the statement continued.",
      "While sharing a statement from Spain's Ministry of Health that stated paracetamol can be used during pregnancy, the country's minister of health, M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda, called out Mr. Trump specifically for misinformation and lack of evidence.",
      "\"Trump's new crusade is against paracetamol during pregnancy, ignoring all scientific evidence,\" she wrote on X. \"This denialism only sows alarm and misinformation. It's better to listen to health authorities than to the person who suggested injecting bleach against COVID,\" referring to a remark Mr. Trump made in 2020.",
      "A World Health Organization spokesperson said Tuesday that evidence of a link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism \"remains inconsistent,\" according to Reuters.",
      "International-based studies have been part of the evidence that shows acetaminophen use during pregnancy is safe.",
      "In a\u00a0major study published last year, for example, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "In the U.S., organizations \u2014 including one that represents those who treat pregnant patients, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u2014 have countered the claimed link, saying there's \"no clear evidence.\"",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",
      "And the\u00a0Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement that any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on \"limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump suggested Tuesday that London officials want to \"go to sharia law,\" a comment London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office called \"bigoted\" and \"appalling.\"",
    "story": [
      "London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office called President Trump's comments \"bigoted,\" after the president appeared to make the false claim that London wants to \"go to sharia law\" and was a city that had \"changed\" under the mayor's leadership.",
      "\"I have to say, I look at London where you have a terrible mayor \u2014 terrible, terrible mayor \u2014 and it's been so changed, so changed,\" Mr. Trump said during his address to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. \"Now they want to go to sharia law ... Both their immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump used the word \"they\" without clarifying if he meant Khan and London, his comments echoed long running far-right conspiracy theories online linking Khan, who is the first Muslim to be elected mayor of London, to Islamic fundamentalism. There is no evidence that Khan has advocated for London to officially adopt Sharia, a system of religious laws that is used in some Muslim countries but not by the U.K. government.",
      "\"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response,\" a spokesperson for London's mayor told CBS News in an e-mailed statement Tuesday. \"London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.\"",
      "In response, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said: \"President Trump is right \u2014 unchecked migration into western countries is making the world a more dangerous place.\"",
      "A number of politicians in Britain came to Khan's defense following Mr. Trump's comments, including members of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. Khan is a member of Starmer's ruling, left-leaning Labour party.",
      "\"Sadiq Khan is not trying to impose Sharia Law on London,\" U.K. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in a post on X Tuesday. \"This is a Mayor who marches with pride, who stands up for differences of background and opinion, who's focused on improving our transport, our air, our streets, our safety, our choices and chances.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks \u2014 made within a wider context of criticizing the immigration policy of European countries \u2014 revived a spat between Khan and the president that stretches back nearly a decade.",
      "In 2015, Sadiq Khan roundly condemned then-candidate Donald Trump after he called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" on national security grounds, following a terrorist attack in California. Early in his first term, Mr. Trump moved to restrict travel to the U.S. by residents of several mostly Muslim countries, though it did not explicitly ban entry to the U.S. by all Muslims.",
      "That initial criticism has led to a colorful back-and-forth between the two over the years. Just last week, Mr. Trump said Khan was \"among the worst mayors in the world,\" and told reporters that he asked that Khan not be present at the banquet hosted by King Charles III during the president's state visit to the U.K.",
      "Mr. Trump has also often claimed that crime in London has risen dramatically during Khan's tenure, including in last week's comments to reporters, when he said crime in London was \"through the roof.\"",
      "Overall recorded crime in London has increased by 31.5% over the past 10 years, with violent crime increasing by 40%, according to U.K. office for National Statistics data cited by CBS News' partners at the BBC. Khan first took office as London's mayor in May 2016.",
      "But data from the Metropolitan Police shows that London had a homicide rate of 11.8 per million people in 2024. That makes the homicide rate in England's capital lower than in a number of major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., according to data cited by the White House.",

Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes in Lebanon, and the two sides became locked in conflict.",
      "Since the ceasefire took effect, Israel has continued to launch near-daily airstrikes in southern Lebanon. Israeli officials frequently say it is targeting Hezbollah militants or infrastructure. Hezbollah has only acknowledged firing across the border once since the ceasefire, but Israel says the militant group is trying to rebuild its capabilities.",

      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",
      "\"All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,\" he said.",

      "Lee, who is a New Zealand citizen, had traveled to South Korea and changed her name in 2018, shortly after the children are believed to have been killed. She was born in South Korea and went by the name Ji Eun Lee previously.",
      "The 45-year-old woman was arrested in South Korea in September 2022 and extradited one month later. She denied the charges, with her lawyers arguing that she was insane at the time of the murders.",
      "Lawyers for Lee admitted she had killed the children by giving them an anti-depressant medication called nortriptyline, but they said the deaths happened after their client had \"descended into madness.\" Lee had always been \"fragile,\" said lawyer Lorraine Smith, but her mental illness became worse after her husband's death.",
      "During the trial, a palliative care counselor said in a statement read to the court that Lee had said she \"wanted it all to be over\" and often mentioned ending both her and her husband's life, the Australian national broadcaster ABC reported.",
      "At one point, Lee thought it would be best if the whole family died, Smith said, but that she had got the dose wrong and when she woke up, the children were dead.",
      "After Tuesday's verdict, Justice Geoffrey Venning ordered that Lee remain in custody until she is sentenced on Nov. 26. Murder carries a mandatory life sentence in New Zealand, with judges required to set a prison term of at least 10 years before an offender can apply for parole.",
      "Prosecutors said Lee had likely suffered from depression but that it was not severe enough to support an insanity defense. In New Zealand, such a claim requires a murder defendant to prove they were incapable of understanding what they were doing or that it was wrong.",
      "There was a \"cold calculation\" to Lee's actions, prosecutor Natalie Walker told the court. Walker said Lee had killed her children out of selfishness and planned to begin a new life without them.",
      "The children's remains were discovered after Lee stopped paying rental fees for an Auckland storage unit when she ran into financial difficulties in 2022.",
      "The pair were found in separate peach-colored suitcases, wrapped in plastic, a police officer who first investigated the matter told the court. The grisly discovery came after an unsuspecting family bought a trailer-load of items \u2014 including the suitcases \u2014 at an auction for abandoned goods near Auckland.",
      "Venning said when the trial began on Sept. 8 it would be distressing to Lee and granted her permission to watch the proceedings from another room in the courthouse. She returned to the dock for the verdict, and stood with her head bowed and her hair covering her face, New Zealand news outlets reported.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists say they've discovered an ancient, long-submerged Mediterranean port, but for the head of the mission, the real treasure is still hidden.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0Archaeologists say they have discovered evidence of an ancient, long-submerged Mediterranean port that was linked to the Taposiris Magna Temple near Egypt's northern coastal city of Alexandria. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery last week, expanding on what's known about the temple complex about 30 miles west of Alexandria that dates to the Ptolemaic period, more than 2,000 years ago.",
      "The Egyptian-Dominican archaeological mission, led by Dr. Kathleen Martinez from the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henriquez Ure\u00f1a, along with Dr. Robert Ballard, who located the Titanic shipwreck in 1985, has been conducting geological and archaeological surveys of the coastal area surrounding the temple.",
      "Working in collaboration with Dr. Larry Mayer, from the University of New Hampshire, and the Egyptian Navy Hydrographic Department (ENHD) and the Egyptian Department of Underwater Antiquities, it was this team that uncovered the evidence of an ancient submerged port.",
      "Martinez told CBS News that after mapping the seabed with state-of-the-art sonar technologies, and then using software to simulate pre-submersion conditions, the team revealed a submerged ancient shoreline about 2.5 miles from the present coast, including a site with an old inner harbor that would have been protected by coral reefs.",
      "Their research also revealed an extension of a tunnel linking the temple, the remains of which are about half of a mile from the current coastline, to the old port. The tunnel extended to an area known as \"Salam 5,\" where divers found basalt base fragments similar to those from statues inside the sanctuary.",
      "The team also found several stone and metal anchors of various shapes and sizes scattered near the reef, along with numerous broken amphorae that were recovered from inside the sunken harbor, all dating to the Ptolemaic period.",
      "Martinez told CBS News that, along with the discovery of seven shafts connected to an underground passage near the sanctuary of Taposiris Magna, linked with other subsurface structures and some contemporary buildings in front of the sanctuary, the findings \"strongly indicate that Taposiris Magna functioned as an active maritime zone with at least an inner harbor in antiquity.\"",
      "\"The development of peripheral harbors, towards the decongestion of the central one in Alexandria, would be a matter of necessity. Taposiris Magna would be part of the network of peripheral harbor towns, providing access to Egypt from the west, and assisting in the distribution of Egyptian products across the Mediterranean,\" she said.",
      "As no ancient texts refer to a harbor at Taposiris Magna, the results of the research represent a significant contribution of new knowledge, throwing open an entirely new chapter in the history of the site, Martinez said.",
      "The quest for Cleopatra's tomb",
      "But while discovering the port is important, she's looking for something else. Like many other archaeologists, Martinez wants to find the tomb of Egypt's last queen, Cleopatra VII, who ruled from about 51 B.C. - 30 B.C.",
      "While many of her contemporaries in the field have long focused their hunt for Cleopatra's tomb among the ruins of Alexandria's Royal Quarters, Martinez has trained her sights for the last 20 years on Taposiris Magna.",
      "\"I dedicated 10 years previous to that to studying Cleopatra's life and death,\" said Martinez.",
      "The ancient queen allied herself with Roman general Mark Antony after Julius Caesar's death, to jointly face Caesar's heir Octavian (or Octavius).",
      "When they were defeated at the Battle of Actium, they fled to Egypt. Octavius pursued them, and in 30 B.C. they both committed suicide separately, but they are believed by many historians to have been buried together in Alexandria.",
      "Martinez, however, believes the tomb is actually in Taposiris Magna, about 30 miles further southwest down Egypt's Mediterranean coast. She considers it \"the perfect final resting place for Queen Cleopatra.\"",
      "When she started the project, Martinez presented her hypothesis to Egyptian officials.",
      "\"Of course, they didn't believe me,\" she told CBS News.",
      "She said she predicted they would find a necropolis at the site, likely from the time of Cleopatra.",
      "\"We did,\" she told CBS News. \"We have already discovered and excavated 21 catacombs. We have a projection that at least we have 20 or 25 more\u2026\u00a0 We have more than 600 human remains and more than 30 mummies\u2026 And we will discover the tomb [of Cleopatra].\"",
      "There are archeologists who disagree with Martinez and stand by the theory that Cleopatra's tomb is in the Royal Quarters, in the center of ancient Alexandria. But she's unmoved.",
      "\"It's not there, because the Romans hated Queen Cleopatra. And they wanted desperately to take her to Rome and parade her,\" Martinez told CBS News. \"Octavius would have done anything to bring Cleopatra to Rome and parade her in chains, and maybe give her the most horrible death that the Romans could inflict.\"",
      "\"But Cleopatra didn't want to go to Rome, and she tried to find a way to escape from that destiny and she wanted to stay in Egypt.\"",
      "Martinez said the new Roman emperor could have taken her alive, or brought her remains to Rome, so she needed to secure a location where her remains could not be easily discovered, which she believes would have made the Royal Quarters a very unlikely choice.",
      "Taposiris Magna was built as a temple dedicated to the goddess Isis, and Cleopatra, Martinez said, \"presented herself always, as the new Isis.\"",
      "She explained that the location had a strong religious context, and crucially, it was not under the control of the Romans at the time, unlike the Royal Quarters.",
      "\"She outsmarted the Romans,\" said Martinez.",
      "Martinez told CBS News that the team will continue their exploration of the harbor site in about a week, and it is set to go on for at least another two months.",
      "\"This is the first time that we're going to actually excavate underwater. It is going to be very exciting,\" she said, adding that nobody is known to have ever dived at the site before. \"We don't know what we're going to discover there because this is the beginning of the search.\"",
      "\"It's a mystery. There was very little information about this place,\" she said. \"The site itself sometimes leads you in a certain direction.\"",
      "For two millennia, Cleopatra has been successful in hiding the location of her remains, not just from the Romans, but from archaeologists.",
      "Martinez has no hangups about dedicating herself to the quest for Cleopatra for nearly three decades.",
      "\"Well, it's a 2,000-year-old puzzle, and you are putting the pieces together,\"\u00a0 she told CBS News, adding that she remains \"100% convinced that it's a matter of time\" before her work finally pays off.",

We would like to thank her for her kindness and support in the past.\"",
      "The Teenage Cancer Trust, which had an association with Ferguson for 35 years, also dropped her as a patron.",
      "The email referred to a 2011\u00a0interview with the Evening Standard newspaper in which she apologized for accepting 15,000 pounds from Epstein.",
      "\"I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf. I am just so contrite I cannot say,'' Ferguson said in the interview. \"Whenever I can, I will repay the money and have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again.\"",
      "But the following month, Ferguson sent an email to Epstein in which she \"humbly apologized\" for linking him to sex abuse, saying \"you have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family,\" The Sun newspaper reported over the weekend.",

      "Epstein\u00a0died by suicide in 2019 while he was in custody facing federal sex trafficking charges.",

      "\"Today's act of recognition reflects Australia's longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, which has always been the only path to enduring peace and security for the Israeli and Palestinian people,\" Albanese said in a statement.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded with an angry statement on Sunday, saying the establishment of a Palestinian state \"will not happen.\"",
      "He accused Britain and other Western allies of giving a \"reward\" to Hamas.",
      "\"I have a clear message for those leaders who recognise a Palestinian state after the horrific massacre on October 7: you are granting a huge reward to terror,\" he said. \"And I have another message for you: it will not happen. No Palestinian state will be established west of the Jordan River.\"",
      "The prime minister said he would announce Israel's response to Sunday's announcements after a trip next week to the U.S., where he is to meet with President Trump at the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump voiced his disapproval of the U.K.'s recognition of a Palestinian state during a state visit to Britain last week.",
      "\"I have a disagreement with the prime minister on that score,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Though the move is largely symbolic, it is a historic moment as the U.K. arguably laid the groundwork for the creation of the Israeli state when it was in control of what was then known as Palestine in 1917.",
      "More than 140 countries have already taken that step and more are expected to do so at the U.N. General Assembly this week, including France.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that France's decision to recognize a Palestinian state is necessary to combat Hamas.",
      "\"The objective of Hamas is absolutely not to create a Palestinian state,\" he said. \"The objective of Hamas is to destroy Israel, to convince the maximum number of people that they have no chance to have peace and stability, and precisely a Palestinian state. And to kill the maximum number of Israeli people. And this is why, if we want to stop this war, if we want to isolate Hamas, the recognition process and the peace plan which goes with this recognition process is a precondition.\"",
      "Critics, including the U.S. and the Israeli government, which has shown no interest in a two-state solution, have condemned the plans, saying it rewards Hamas for its attack on Oct. 7, 2023. As well as arguing that recognition is immoral, critics argue that it's an empty gesture given that the Palestinian people are divided into two territories \u2014 the West Bank and Gaza \u2014 with no recognized international capital.",
      "The war started on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in their attack on southern Israel. Forty-eight hostages remain in Gaza, with many released through ceasefires or other agreements. Israel believes about 20 are still alive, though the bodies of two hostages were recovered during a joint operation in late August.",
      "The Palestinian head of mission in the U.K., Husam Zomlot, told CBS News partner the BBC that recognition would right a colonial-era wrong.",
      "\"The issue today is ending the denial of our existence that started 108 years ago, in 1917,\" he said. \"And I think today, the British people should celebrate a day when history is being corrected, when wrongs are being righted, when recognition of the wrongs of the past are beginning to be corrected.\""

      "Authorities in the Dominican Republic said Sunday they have confiscated some of the cocaine transported by a speedboat that was destroyed recently by the U.S. Navy, in what the Caribbean nation called the first operation of its kind.",
      "In a news conference, the Dominican Republic's National Directorate for Drug Control (DNCD) said it recovered 377 packages of cocaine from the boat which was allegedly carrying 1,000 kilograms, or more than 2,200 pounds, of the drug. The drugs were recovered after \"an aerial military strike by the United States against a speedboat of narcoterrorists,\" the DNCD said in a statement.",
      "At the news conference, a spokesperson for the U.S. embassy said the attack is the one President Donald Trump first announced Friday without saying where it had taken place, following several U.S. attacks on alleged drug boats off Venezuela. Mr. Trump at the time said three \"male narcoterrorists\" were killed.",
      "Officials said the boat was destroyed about 80 nautical miles south of Isla Beata, a small island that belongs to the Dominican Republic. They said the Dominican's Republic Navy worked in conjunction with U.S. authorities to locate the speedboat which was allegedly trying to dock in the Dominican Republic and use the nation as a \"bridge\" to transport cocaine to the United States.",
      "Officials released a video of the operation, showing officers unloading and inspecting bricks of the alleged drugs, some bearing the word \"MEN\" on the packaging.",
      "\"This is the first time in history that the United States and the Dominican Republic carry out a joint operation against narco terrorism in the Caribbean,\" the directorate said in a statement.",

      "The White House says the naval flotilla has destroyed at least three boats carrying drugs so far. The separate strikes have killed more than a dozen people aboard the vessels.",
      "Human rights groups have said the strikes on the boats amount to extra judicial killings, and on Friday two Democratic senators introduced a resolution in Congress that seeks to block the administration from carrying out further strikes.",
      "The Trump administration says two of the boats that have been sunk left from Venezuela, whose president is often described by White House officials as a drug trafficker and leader of a gang known as the Cartel of the Suns.",
      "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro denies the charges and has described the U.S naval build up in the Caribbean as an attack on his country. Maduro has called the warships an \"absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\"",
      "On two occasions earlier this month, Venezuelan fighter jets flew near a U.S. naval ship, in what multiple Defense Department officials\u00a0described to CBS News\u00a0as a \"game of chicken.\"",

      "His favorite move for stability is the Paloff press. \"Anchor a band, press it straight out and resist rotation,\" he instructed. \"Do it standing or kneeling. This is how you teach your body to brace and protect your back during everyday life.\"",

      "Marfred cautioned that when strength training, \"safety is everything, especially after midlife.\"",

      "DOT said these unfulfilled grants were to help install safety fencing, grade crossing upgrades and a trespassing alert system. The grants included $24.9 million for a trespassing and intrusion mitigation project, $15.4 million for a Broward County sealed corridor project, $1.6 million for a trespassing identification and classification system and a $150,000 grant for Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office to support overtime costs for enforcement of pedestrian trespassing at hot spots.",

      "How Wisconsin's solar battery park powers 130,000 homes",
      "The Paris Solar farm began producing power in December 2024 and generates 200 megawatts of renewable electricity during the day. That amount is enough to supply about 55,000 homes each year.",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s first large-scale solar battery park combines solar power with storage, providing reliable clean energy day and night. (We Energies)",
      "Now, a 110-megawatt battery storage system has been added. These batteries capture excess energy from the solar panels and release it at night, during cloudy weather, or when demand suddenly rises. The battery system can power about 130,000 homes for up to four hours.",

      "Why Wisconsin's solar battery park is a historic energy shift",
      "Energy use is climbing, and nearly 79 percent of electricity in the United States still comes from fossil fuels. That dependence contributes to increased carbon pollution, higher costs and leaves the grid vulnerable during extreme conditions.",
      "The Paris Solar-Battery Park reduces reliance on fossil fuels while strengthening Wisconsin's grid. It also provides a model other states can follow.",
      "Mike Hooper, president of project partner We Energies, called the project\u00a0\"historic\" and stressed that customers can count on dependable and affordable power in any weather. That level of reliability is especially crucial as storms, heatwaves and cold snaps put additional pressure on power systems.",

      "What Wisconsin's solar battery park means for clean energy",
      "Battery storage is becoming a cornerstone of the clean energy movement. Without storage, solar power only helps while the sun is shining. With it, renewable energy becomes flexible, consistent and available around the clock.",
      "This shift benefits both the environment and consumers. Solar farms have been shown to cut electric bills by 5 to 20 percent. Additionally, the Paris Solar-Battery Park is eligible for federal tax credits, which can pass on savings to residents.",
      "Recent policy changes may reduce some of those incentives in the future. Even so, pairing solar with battery storage remains one of the most effective ways to lower costs and reduce emissions.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018The Cyberguy\u2019 Knutsson explains how to keep your Windows computer safe and security risks of online retail giant Temu.",
      "Earlier this year, Australian police arrested a passenger for running a malicious Wi-Fi network both at an airport and during a flight. The setup looked just like the airline's own Wi-Fi service, but it wasn't. Instead, it was what cybersecurity researchers call an \"evil twin,\" a fake hotspot designed to trick people into handing over their credentials.",
      "The idea isn't new, but the setting is. For years, fake Wi-Fi networks have been a common trick in cafes, hotels, and airports. What makes this case stand out is that the attacker took it to the skies, exploiting the growing reliance on in-flight Wi-Fi for entertainment and internet access.",

      "What is an evil twin Wi-Fi attack?",
      "An evil twin hotspot is a wireless network that impersonates a legitimate one by copying its name, also known as the SSID. When multiple networks with the same name exist, your phone or laptop often connects to the one with the stronger signal, which is usually the attacker's.",
      "Travelers check their phones while navigating delays and flight cancellations at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on July 19, 2024, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)",
      "Once connected, victims are often redirected to a fake login or landing page. In this case, the malicious portal requested passengers' email addresses, passwords, or even social media credentials under the pretense of granting access to the airline's entertainment system. The stolen information could then be used for account takeovers, identity theft, or further attacks.",
      "Why travel Wi-Fi is a prime target",
      "Travel creates a perfect storm for these kinds of attacks. Whether you're in a hotel, airport, cruise ship or airplane, you often have limited choices for getting online. Mobile data may be patchy or expensive, which pushes people toward the available Wi-Fi networks. Because these services feel official and are tied to trusted brands, travelers tend to assume they're safe and let their guard down when login requests pop up.",
      "Another trend adds to the risk. Travel providers are increasingly moving entertainment and services onto personal devices instead of offering built-in options. Airlines replace seatback screens with streaming portals, cruise lines promote app-based services and hotels direct guests to digital check-in platforms. All of these require a Wi-Fi connection, which means more people are logging on than ever before.",
      "QANTAS DATA BREACH EXPOSES MILLIONS OF CUSTOMER RECORDS",
      "How hackers trick you with fake in-flight Wi-Fi",
      "Here's how it worked in the Australian case. The attacker carried a portable hotspot onboard and named it to match the airline's official Wi-Fi network. Passengers, seeing the fake network with stronger signal strength, connected automatically. They were then taken to a counterfeit login page asking for personal details.",
      "A traveler awaits their delayed luggage after United Airlines grounded flights due to a tech outage at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, Aug. 6, 2025.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Ryan Murphy)",

      "YOUR DISCARDED LUGGAGE TAGS ARE WORTH MONEY TO SCAMMERS",
      "Why you need a VPN for in-flight Wi-Fi security",
      "One of the best defenses against rogue Wi-Fi is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, making it far harder for attackers to intercept your data even if you connect to the wrong hotspot.",
      "There is a catch, though. In-flight Wi-Fi systems often require you to disable your VPN temporarily to access the onboard portal. Even then, a VPN remains an important safeguard. Once you have cleared the login page and, if you have paid, connected to the internet, enabling your VPN ensures that any browsing, messaging, or app traffic stays private.",

      "A VPN is important, but it isn't the only defense you should rely on. Here are some other ways to stay safe when connecting midair:",
      "Before you even think about connecting to in-flight Wi-Fi, make sure your device has a strong antivirus installed. It's your first line of defense against malicious sites and apps that attackers may try to push through fake portals. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Even if an attacker manages to steal your login credentials,\u00a02FA can stop them from getting into your accounts. Use app-based authenticators rather than SMS codes whenever possible, since they work offline and are harder to intercept.",
      "Most phones and laptops are set to reconnect automatically to familiar networks. This makes it easier for a fake hotspot with the same name to trick your device. Before you board, switch off auto-connect and manually choose the correct airline Wi-Fi.",
      "When browsing in-flight, check for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar. HTTPS encrypts the connection between your device and the website, making it harder for attackers on public Wi-Fi to intercept your data.",
      "Even with precautions, in-flight Wi-Fi should be treated as untrusted. Avoid logging in to sensitive accounts like online banking or work systems. Stick to light browsing, streaming or messaging until you're back on a secure connection.",
      "Outdated operating systems and apps often have security holes attackers exploit. Before your trip, install the latest updates on your phone, tablet or laptop. Many updates include security patches that protect you against known vulnerabilities.",
      "When possible, switch your device to airplane mode and then enable only Wi-Fi. This reduces exposure from other radios (like Bluetooth or cellular roaming) that attackers sometimes target on flights.",
      "Some fake in-flight portals use pop-ups or redirects designed to trick you into entering login details or clicking on malicious links. If a page asks for unnecessary information, like your full Social Security number, banking details or unrelated logins, treat it as a red flag. Close the page immediately and don\u2019t click.",
      "When the flight is over, sign out of the airline's Wi-Fi portal and any accounts you accessed. This prevents session hijacking if the system keeps tokens cached.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The rise of evil twin attacks in the air is a reminder that convenience often comes with hidden risks. As airlines push more passengers toward in-flight Wi-Fi, attackers are finding ways to exploit that dependency. Next time you fly, think twice before blindly connecting to the first Wi-Fi network that pops up. Sometimes, the safest choice is to stay offline until you land.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "AI browsers are no longer just an idea; they're already here. Microsoft has built Copilot into Edge, OpenAI is testing a sandboxed browser in agent mode and Perplexity's Comet is one of the first to fully embrace the concept of browsing for you.",
      "This is agentic AI stepping into our daily routines, from searching and reading to shopping and clicking. Instead of simply assisting us, these tools are beginning to replace us.",
      "But with this shift comes a new era of digital deception. AI-powered browsers may promise convenience by handling shopping, emails and other tasks, yet research shows they can stumble into scams faster than humans ever could. This dangerous mix of speed and trust is what experts call Scamlexity, a complex, AI-driven scam landscape where your agent gets tricked, and you pay the price.",

      "Falling for the same old tricks",
      "AI browsers are not immune to classic scams. In fact, they can fall for them even faster. When researchers at Guardio Labs told an AI browser to buy an Apple Watch, it confidently completed the purchase on a fake Walmart store set up in minutes. It autofilled personal and payment details without hesitation. The scammer got the money, while the human never saw the red flags.",
      "AI browsers promise convenience, but security experts warn they can fall for online scams faster than humans. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Handling phishing emails from \"your bank\"",
      "Old phishing tactics also remain effective. In testing, researchers at Guardio Labs sent a fake Wells Fargo email to the AI browser. The browser clicked the malicious link with no verification and even helped the user fill out login credentials on the phishing page. By removing human intuition from the loop, the AI created a perfect trust chain that scammers could exploit.",
      "PromptFix: A modern AI injection scam",
      "The real danger comes from attacks designed specifically for AI. Researchers at Guardio Labs created PromptFix, a scam disguised as a CAPTCHA page. While humans would only see a checkbox, the AI agent read hidden malicious instructions in the page code. Believing it was \"helping,\" the AI clicked the button, triggering a download that could have been malware. This type of prompt injection bypasses human awareness and targets the AI's decision-making directly. Once compromised, the AI can send emails, share files or execute harmful tasks without the user ever knowing.",
      "The growing risks of AI browsers",
      "As agentic AI becomes mainstream, scams will scale at an alarming speed. Instead of fooling millions of people individually, attackers need only to compromise one AI model to reach millions at once. Security experts warn this is a structural risk, not just a phishing problem.",
      "Tips to protect yourself from AI browser scams",
      "AI browsers can save time, but they can also put you at risk if you rely on them too much. Use these practical steps to stay in control and reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Always double-check sensitive actions like purchases, downloads or logins. Keep final approval in your hands instead of letting the AI complete tasks on its own. This way, you prevent scammers from sneaking past your awareness.",
      "Scammers rely on exposed personal details to make their tricks more convincing. A trusted data removal service can help scrub your information from broker sites, reducing the chance that your AI agent hands over details that are already floating around online. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "Install and keep strong antivirus software updated. It adds an extra line of defense that can catch threats your AI browser may miss, including malicious files and unsafe downloads. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "1) Refurbished does not always mean like new",
      "In the tech industry, the label refurbished carries no uniform standard. From factory-certified devices that meet stringent quality checks to third-party refurbishments that address only surface-level defects, the range is vast. My experience shows that treating refurbished items as \"like new\" is a mistake. Many come with cosmetic blemishes or partially worn components, and some sellers stop at a basic reset and cleaning.",
      "The key is to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process and request detailed specifications or photos to ensure the item is in good condition. Look for transparency about what has been repaired or replaced. A reputable refurbisher will disclose whether critical components such as screens, batteries or motherboards were replaced or simply tested.",
      "Pro tip: Many refurbishers use a grading system (A, B, C). Grade A means near new, Grade B usually has light scratches, while Grade C shows heavier wear. Knowing the grade helps set realistic expectations.",
      "2) Check the warranty and return policy",
      "One of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of buying refurbished electronics is the warranty and return policy. Through years of testing products, I've seen warranties vary wildly from generous 90-day coverage to none at all. A solid warranty is not just a formality; it's a reflection of the refurbisher's confidence in the quality of the product. Without it, you're taking a gamble.",
      "Industry best practices suggest opting for sellers who provide at least a 90-day warranty and a clear, no-hassle return window. I have consistently seen reliable refurbishers like Amazon Renewed, eBay Certified Refurbished and Back Market stand by their work with transparent policies.",
      "Also look at Apple Certified Refurbished and Dell Outlet, which are industry leaders for high-quality laptops, tablets and phones.",
      "3) Know the seller's reputation",
      "Not all sellers are equal when it comes to refurbished tech. My years covering consumer electronics have made it clear that choosing a reputable seller is more important than chasing the lowest price. Factory-certified refurbishers and authorized resellers tend to follow strict testing and quality control procedures. In contrast, independent sellers often vary in quality and reliability.",
      "I always emphasize researching the seller's history, reading verified customer reviews and ensuring they offer clear refurbishment guarantees. Established marketplaces and brand-certified stores provide additional layers of security, including dispute resolution mechanisms.",
      "Red flags include: vague warranty language, listings with only stock photos, \"open box\" items marketed as refurbished and any product sold \"as-is.\" If you see those, walk away.",
      "4) Don't forget accessories and packaging",
      "A less obvious but important consideration is the state of accessories and packaging. In industry practice, refurbished products rarely arrive in original packaging or with the full set of accessories. I've seen that some sellers ship devices with generic boxes and subpar third-party accessories or omit chargers and manuals altogether.",
      "If accessories are important to your workflow, don't assume they'll be included. Always verify the listing description and, when in doubt, ask the seller directly. Knowing exactly what comes in the box prevents surprises and ensures you don't have to hunt for compatible chargers or cables after the fact, potentially eroding any savings you initially gained.",
      "5) Battery life may not be the same",
      "A common misconception is that refurbished devices come with batteries that perform like new, but that's not the case. Batteries naturally degrade with use, and not all refurbishers replace them.",
      "Some sellers disclose battery replacement while others do not. It is critical to confirm whether the battery is new, tested or original. Otherwise, expect performance issues such as rapid discharge or failure to hold a charge. A device with a worn-out battery is rarely worth the lower upfront cost, as you'll likely need to replace the battery soon after purchase.",

      "A good warranty and return policy are essential safeguards for choosing refurbished devices. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "6) Software updates and compatibility",
      "You should only use electronic items like phones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches as long as they're receiving software updates. Many might disagree with this, but the truth is that once software support ends, your device becomes vulnerable to all kinds of unpatchable security flaws. Some good brands known for reliable software support are Apple, Samsung, Google, MSI and Lenovo.",
      "Before purchasing, always verify that the device is still supported with regular updates. This information is often available on the manufacturer's website or through trusted tech resources.",
      "7) Test the device thoroughly after purchase",
      "Testing a refurbished device thoroughly upon arrival is a best practice I've recommended repeatedly in my writing. Even trusted sellers can occasionally miss a defect. I always advise checking every essential function, such as the screen, charging port, Wi-Fi, sound and camera, within the seller's return period. Many problems won't be obvious from photos or descriptions alone.",
      "Immediate testing ensures you catch issues early enough to return or replace the product without hassle. It's a small investment of time that prevents far bigger frustrations later.",
      "And don't forget to perform your own factory reset on\u00a0iPhone,\u00a0Android,\u00a0PC or Mac to ensure no old accounts, locks or data are lingering on the device. For Apple devices, make sure \"Find My iPhone\" has been disabled before purchase, or it may be unusable.",
      "8) Install strong antivirus software",
      "Refurbished devices can sometimes carry hidden risks, especially if the previous owner didn't wipe the device properly or if the seller missed deep software issues. Installing\u00a0 strong antivirus software is essential to protect your device from malware, spyware or other security threats that may be lurking.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "9) Use a password manager",
      "Security doesn't end with antivirus protection. Many refurbished devices come with pre-installed software or misconfigured settings that could expose you to risk. One of the smartest moves you can make is using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "10) Know the real value of your savings",
      "Refurbished doesn't always mean a bargain. As a rule of thumb, expect to save 20-40% compared to new, depending on the brand, age and condition. If you're only saving 10-15%, the trade-off on warranty, lifespan or battery may not be worth it. Calculate the long-term cost, especially if you'll need to buy a new battery or accessories soon after.",

      "Refurbished products often arrive without original packaging or accessories, leaving buyers unprepared. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Bonus: The eco-friendly upside",
      "Every refurbished device purchased keeps one more gadget out of the landfill and reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Studies show buying refurbished can cut a product's carbon footprint nearly in half. That means you're not only saving money but also helping the planet.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Buying refurbished electronics can be a great way to save money and reduce e-waste. But it pays to be careful. By sticking with certified sellers, knowing what \"refurbished\" really means and insisting on warranties and clear return policies, you can protect both your wallet and your data.",

So, it's just a conversation that I really recommend parents have with their children.\"\u00a0According to Whitcomb you can also score points with your children by using Sony's parental control features to encourage better habits away from the screen, including more game time as a reward for doing chores around the house.",

      "Avoid printing your full home address or primary phone number. Instead, use your name, a travel-only email and either a P.O. box or work address. You can even create a simple alias email just for travel, which forwards to your main inbox but keeps your real address private. This way, airlines and honest finders can still reach you without exposing sensitive personal details to scammers.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Another way to protect yourself is by putting a small tracker inside your luggage, such as an\u00a0Apple AirTag or a\u00a0similar Bluetooth tracker. These devices connect to your phone and let you see where your bag is in near real-time. If your suitcase goes missing or ends up in the wrong place, you\u2019ll know faster than waiting for the airline to track it down.",
      "Place the tracker inside your bag rather than on the handle so it can\u2019t be easily removed. Check its location through your phone before leaving the airport, and keep an eye on it during layovers. While AirTags can\u2019t prevent someone from misusing an old luggage tag, they give you proof of where your bag actually is if you ever need to dispute a lost luggage claim or theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "While the luggage tag scam may not be widespread yet, it exploits a simple oversight that most travelers rarely consider. Until airlines and airports put better safeguards in place, the burden falls on passengers to protect their own information. That means treating something as ordinary as a bag tag like sensitive data.",

He wanted to hear what I had to say on issues he expected to be asked about. Why would he do that if he had abandoned Israel? The very fact the meeting happened proves he had not.\"",

      "Stefanik described several hostages who required specialized care. One hostage was being treated for cancer on Oct. 7. Another lost his hand during a grenade explosion at the Nova festival. A third was kidnapped while nine months pregnant and gave birth while held captive. \"None is included in MSF\u2019s \u2018humanitarian\u2019 advocacy,\" Stefanik said.",
      "Stefanik also called into question the \"extremist actions and rhetoric\" of MSF staff, which have led to criticism of the organization. In one case, after MSF lamented the death of a staffer who was killed in Gaza in June 2024; the Israel Defense Forces confirmed he was a rocket expert for Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In another, a staffer publicly called for Palestinians to \"fight and die as martyrs\" according to the French publication Le Journal du Dimanche in March 2024.",
      "A Palestinian woman carries a box as people seek aid supplies from the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in the central Gaza Strip, Aug. 4, 2025. (Reuters/Stringer)",

      "\"This is not a matter of routine oversight,\" Stefanik concluded. \"It is a matter of national security, the protection of U.S. taxpayers and donors, and the defense of legitimate humanitarian organizations in one of the most dangerous conflict zones in the world. President Trump has made clear that the United States will never tolerate support for terrorist organizations in any form, and this case demands that same clarity and resolve.\"",

      "Jimmy Kimmel broke his silence after his brief suspension from the airwaves, posting a picture to Instagram on Tuesday of a Hollywood figure who once described himself as being on President Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cenemies list.\u201d",
      "Kimmel shared a photo of himself and Norman Lear, the television producer who was best known for his progressive activism. Lear died in 2023 at age 101. The late-night host captioned the photo, which features his arm around Lear, \u201cMissing this guy today.\u201d",
      "\u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d is set to return to ABC on Tuesday night after the network suspended the show over what it described as \u201cill-timed\u201d comments from Kimmel on the murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.",
      "During his Sept. 15 show, Kimmel criticized some Republicans for how they were responding to Kirk\u2019s killing.",
      "\u201cThe MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\u201d Kimmel said during his monologue.",
      "Disney\u2019s ABC said last week that it was pre-empting Kimmel\u2019s show \u201cindefinitely\u201d following threats of regulatory action from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr.",
      "Many, including a handful of celebrities, expressed outrage toward ABC for choosing to pull Kimmel\u2019s show following Carr\u2019s threats.",
      "After increasing public pressure and calls to boycott, Disney announced Monday that Kimmel would return to late night. In its announcement, the company did not address the concerns that Kimmel\u2019s freedom of speech rights had been violated.",
      "Kimmel had not spoken publicly about the suspension since it happened.",
      "The late-night host has described Lear as one of his idols.",
      "Lear developed now-beloved sitcoms such as \u201cAll in the Family\u201d \u201cGood Times,\u201d \u201cThe Jeffersons\u201d and \u201cOne Day at a Time.\u201d His work was defined by being unafraid to tackle social issues long considered taboo.",
      "Over six decades, Lear\u2019s work took up racism, sexism, the women\u2019s liberation movement, antisemitism, abortion, homophobia, the Vietnam War and class conflict.",
      "Lear said his work put him on Nixon\u2019s \u201cenemies list\u201d because he was angry about Lear \u201cglorifying\u201d homosexuality on TV, according to Smithsonian magazine. He appeared delighted to learn of Nixon\u2019s reaction to his work after a tape leaked of the president ranting about \u201cAll in the Family.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought it was delicious that in the Oval Office \u2014 I didn\u2019t care for what he was saying, I didn\u2019t care for that particular president in any shape, way or form \u2014 but to hear the president and his confederates talking about that show and at some length, reasoning about it and comparing it to the Greek civilization, that could not have been more interesting,\u201d he told Talking Points Memo in 2015.",
      "In a 2016 interview with \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d Lear compared Nixon\u2019s rant about his show in the leaked tapes to being \u201cTrumpish.\u201d He also said that he remembered his civics education as a child, which taught him that he was protected by the Founding Fathers.",
      "\u201cBut when I was a boy, I learned to love my Declaration of Independence \u2014 and I underline \u2018my\u2019 \u2014 and my Constitution and my Bill of Rights, because they were the protections Americans needed in a free society where everybody is equal under the law,\u201d Lear said at the time."

    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:16:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts say Turning Point USA's Professor Watchlist laid the groundwork for subsequent attempts to limit what professors and teachers say in the classroom.",
    "story": [
      "In 2016, Charlie Kirk wasn\u2019t yet a household name. The young activist had co-founded Turning Point USA four years earlier to help spread conservative ideas on college campuses. But shortly after President Donald Trump\u2019s first election, the group launched an ambitious new project \u2014 the Professor Watchlist \u2014 aimed at highlighting what it saw as left-leaning bias in higher education.",
      "The list, easily available online, now has more than 300 professor names, listed under categories like \u201cTerror Supporter,\u201d \u201cLGBTQ,\u201d \u201cAntifa\u201d and \u201cSocialism.\u201d Once dismissed by critics as a fringe culture war stunt, education experts say the list helped kick off a movement that continues today to monitor and expose perceived ideological opponents.",
      "Since Kirk\u2019s assassination earlier this month, that movement has accelerated, with conservative activists systematically outing people in what critics have decried as a right-wing version of \u201ccancel culture.\u201d The backlash has led to the removal or resignation of dozens of teachers and professors who allegedly disparaged Kirk or celebrated his death online.",
      "\u201cIf you make statements that right-wing politicians don\u2019t like, then you can lose your job. Period. That is chilling,\u201d said Isaac Kamola, director of the American Association of University Professors\u2019 Center for the Defense of Academic Freedom, who runs a project called Faculty First Responders that helps professors who have been targeted by Turning Point or other groups. \u201cThe Professor Watchlist planted that seed.\u201d",
      "NBC News interviewed six professors on the watchlist, added between 2016 and 2023. Some are on it for work they published and others for outspoken social media posts. Once added, they received negative messages and comments; two said it escalated to death threats.",
      "This atmosphere, which intensified as social media culture evolved, changed how students and professors interact, said Peter Lake, director of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University College of Law.",
      "The watchlist was part of a shift that made \u201cwhat had been a semi-private space \u2014 the classroom \u2014 into a place where statements or discussions could get national attention,\u201d Lake said. Knowing a stray comment could go viral stifles free speech, he added.",
      "\u201cWhen you step in the classroom, you might as well be in the studio,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are going to record what you\u2019re saying, they may publish it, they may take it out of context, they may share it with your enemies \u2014 anything can happen now and it frequently does.\u201d",
      "Those forces were at work earlier this month, for instance, when conservatives circulated a video of a Texas A&M student confronting a senior lecturer in the English department for teaching about gender identity, citing Trump\u2019s executive order recognizing only two genders. The lecturer, who was not on the Professor Watchlist, was fired and two administrators were removed from their posts. Last week, university president Mark Welsh also resigned amid the controversy.",
      "Some conservatives argue the watchlist was a necessary antidote to left-wing bias on campus and helped counter-balance the criticism of right-wing professors.",
      "It was \u201cpart of changing the way the right engaged with higher ed,\u201d said Rick Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \u201cThe problem is not with the list,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that the list was ever necessary.\u201d",
      "Turning Point USA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Charlie Kirk himself defended the project as \u201can awareness tool\u201d in a 2018 interview with \u201cThe Opposition,\u201d a Comedy Central TV show.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Professor Blacklist\u2019 and it\u2019s not \u2018Professor Hitlist,\u2019\u201d Kirk said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re not calling for the termination of these professors \u2014 let the schools make their own decisions.\u201d",
      "Some professors targeted by the watchlist said it sparked a campaign of harassment against them.",
      "Shawn Schwaller, an assistant history professor at California State University, Chico, was added to the list in 2021. His profile includes a long list of allegations, including that he had disparaged conservatives. In one article Schwaller wrote, he offered a defense of protesters at a right-wing Christian event who used flash bombs and bear spray, arguing that they were responding to the \u201cintensely violent rhetoric of a white Christian supremacist.\u201d",
      "Schwaller said he was surprised by the response he received online once his name went public. \u201cI hope the professor gets some lead,\u201d one post read. Another said, \u201cHe better get a third eye behind his head because its gonna get serious for him.\u201d",
      "Preston Mitchum, a former Georgetown Law adjunct professor, found himself on the list after writing on X, formerly Twitter, in 2017, \u201cAll white people are racists. All men are sexist. Yes, ALL cis people are transphobic. We have to unpack that. That\u2019s the work!\u201d",
      "Mitchum had also appeared on a Fox News panel alongside Charlie Kirk to discuss issues around race after President Trump met with Kanye West in 2018. He said he had been receiving backlash from his tweets but the vitriol increased after the segment aired.",
      "He received unwanted calls and emails, Mitchum said, including death threats. \u201cI\u2019m a Black, queer man. I don\u2019t scare often,\u201d he said. He said he finds it hypocritical that Kirk is hailed as a champion of free speech yet created a tool he believes has been used to silence people.",
      "\u201cThe entire goal is censorship, like fundamentally, the goal is to get you to stop talking,\u201d he said.",
      "For some professors, being put on the list was a badge of honor. Charles Roseman, an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, was added after co-authoring an article on sex and gender in Scientific American in 2023. \u201cI\u2019m quite glad to draw their ire,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that they disapprove of me. That\u2019s quite the compliment.\u201d",
      "Kirk, in a 2016 interview with Time magazine, said the list was not meant to intimidate or \u201cmake these professors feel any less secure.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe inspiration was just to shine a light on what we feel has been an unfair balance toward left-leaning ideas and biases in our universities,\u201d he said.",
      "In the years since its inception, the watchlist seems to have inspired other groups. Right-wing influencers like Libs of TikTok now regularly spotlight individual faculty they believe want to indoctrinate students, while conservative parent groups like Moms for Liberty have advocated for state laws limiting what can be discussed in classrooms or shared in libraries. These activists are close allies of the MAGA movement.",
      "Republican governors, such as Ron DeSantis in Florida and Greg Abbott in Texas, have also made fights over \u201cwokeness\u201d in colleges a core component of their legislative agendas.",
      "John Wesley Lowery, an expert in higher education law who advises universities on compliance with federal regulations, said it\u2019s simpler to share details about professors today than when the watchlist was first launched.",
      "\u201cIt is so much easier to crowdsource information now,\u201d he said. And that\u2019s not the only change, he said, noting that past activism targeted individuals. \"What we\u2019ve seen over the last week instead is far more concerted efforts to immediately place pressure on institutions to take action.\u201d",
      "Lake, of Stetson University, said the watchlist was a catalyst in changing the way professors work.",
      "Among professors writ large, he said, there is an \u201cair of fatalism \u2014 do the job long enough, and you could step on a land mine and that could be it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not only professors who limit what they say in class now, he said. The same is true among students. Lake brought up Kirk\u2019s assassination a couple times in class recently, and there was \u201cno reaction,\" he said. \"They don\u2019t want to get caught up in a whirlwind.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 23:55:07 GMT",
    "summary": "After President Donald Trump made the claim that taking acetaminophen during pregnancy raises the risk of autism, doctors say their guidance is staying the same.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Heidi Leftwich, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at UMass Memorial Health, said she has gotten many more questions about acetaminophen from some of her pregnant patients in recent weeks.",
      "The safety of the fever and pain reliever \u201ccomes up periodically,\u201d especially when there\u2019s a news story about it, said Dr. Allison Bryant, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham.",
      "Rather than scare them or dictate what they should do, Bryant said, she favors \u201cshared decision-making\u201d with her patients, with them \u201cat the center\u201d of her guidance.",
      "At a news briefing Monday, President Donald Trump promoted unproven claims that taking acetaminophen during pregnancy was linked to a risk of autism in children. The Food and Drug Administration has sent a letter telling doctors to \u201cconsider minimizing the use of acetaminophen,\u201d the active ingredient in Tylenol and a wide range of other over-the-counter medications, for routine low-grade fevers in pregnant women.",
      "Trump\u2019s announcement came after several weeks of reports about the warning. Pregnant women experiencing pain or fever should \u201ctough it out,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Dr. Laura Riley, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, said patients have come in since Trump\u2019s briefing anxious and unsure what to do. \u201cThere was a lot of head-shaking,\u201d Riley said.",
      "Are doctors changing their guidance about acetaminophen?",
      "More than half of women worldwide use acetaminophen during pregnancy. It is used in hundreds of products, including cough and cold treatments. Doctors said in interview that their advice hasn\u2019t changed, in spite of the Trump administration\u2019s concerns.",
      "\u201cWe normally advise women with pain or fever to take acetaminophen, unless there is some other reason why we think it might be unsafe,\u201d such as when women have allergies or pre-existing liver disease, Bryant said.",
      "Riley said the most common reasons pregnant women take acetaminophen are fever, headache and low back pain.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m telling women not to do anything differently than what we started with, which was Tylenol is one of the best pain relievers that we have in pregnancy,\u201d she said.",
      "Untreated fever, especially in the first three months of pregnancy, increases the risk of miscarriage, birth defects and premature birth, according to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.",
      "Fever in the second and third trimesters can trigger contractions and may be associated with early labor, Riley said, so \u201cit\u2019s important to treat.\u201d",
      "Emily Heumann, 31, was 10 or 12 weeks pregnant when she spiked a fever of 104 degrees because of a viral infection. She\u2019d developed hand, foot and mouth disease \u2014 a highly contagious virus that typically spreads among children \u2014 after she was infected by her 4-year-old son. The infection causes sores in the mouth and a rash on the hands and feet.",
      "Heumann said that although her son experienced only minor symptoms that went away quickly, she experienced severe pain for 10 days, especially because of sores in her throat and inside her ears.",
      "Her doctor told her that it was important to bring her temperature down and suggested she take acetaminophen, often sold under the brand name Tylenol.",
      "\u201cIf the Tylenol didn\u2019t work, they said to go to the emergency room,\u201d said Heumann, who is now 36 weeks pregnant.",
      "Bryant suggests that women with questions about any medication during pregnancy talk to doctors they trust and who know them well.",
      "Both the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine continue to recommend acetaminophen as safe for pregnant women and say the bulk of medical evidence doesn\u2019t show a link to autism. Bryant noted that the groups base their advice on the total body of evidence about acetaminophen and neurodevelopment disorders, not just one study.",
      "\u201cThat guidance is not likely to change anytime soon,\u201d Bryant said.",
      "Leftwich said she feels comfortable talking with her patients about the treatment of fever and pain with acetaminophen during pregnancy. \u201cThis is a very important conversation to have with a trusted physician.\u201d",
      "Untreated pain in pregnancy can be risky, too",
      "Riley said that after Trump warned about acetaminophen use during pregnancy, she's had patients asking, \u201c\u2018the next time I get a headache, what should I do?\u2019\u201d",
      "Her response: \u201cTake Tylenol.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to tough it out,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an appropriate way of managing pain.\u201d",
      "If women ask Bryant about research suggesting a link between acetaminophen and autism, she tells them that the strongest, most rigorous study to examine the question found no association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or intellectual disability.",
      "An important feature of that study of more than 2.4 million children, published last year in JAMA, is that it included siblings of children with autism as a control group. Autism tends to run in families, with twins or siblings of people with autism having a higher risk.",
      "Leftwich said Heumann\u2019s doctor did right by putting the patient first and keeping her needs in mind.",
      "\u201cInstilling undue fear in pregnant individuals could lead to inadequate management of fever and pain,\u201d Leftwich said, adding that untreated pain is associated with depression, anxiety and high blood pressure, which can increase the risk of preterm births.",
      "Heumann said she is grateful that her doctor suggested acetaminophen for her fever, which began to fall within an hour of her taking the medication. Acetaminophen also helped relieve the intense pain from the infection.",
      "\u201cIt was one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d said Heumann, 31, who lives in central Florida. When she tried to sleep at night, \u201claying on the sores was especially painful. The throat pain was the worst.\u201d",
      "Lowest dose for the shortest amount of time",
      "Leftwich said she advises pregnant women to be cautious when they use any medication.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important to talk about the judicious use of any medication,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should use the lowest dose possible to get the treatment that you need, for instance, for fever reduction or pain control. I would say the same about Tylenol as I would for any other medication.\u201d",
      "Heumann said pregnant women have enough to worry about without adding unproven risks.",
      "\u201cEvery mom I know feels guilt regularly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want what\u2019s best for our kids so badly, and no matter what we do, most of us worry ... if what we\u2019ve done is the right thing. This just adds one more thing for moms to worry about. And it\u2019s based in misinformation, which is so dangerous.\u201d",
      "Kati Woock, who developed frequent migraines during her pregnancy five years ago, said her doctor reassured her that taking acetaminophen \u2014 one of the ingredients in her usual migraine treatment \u2014 was safe.",
      "\u201cSometimes with a migraine, I can\u2019t even be vertical,\u201d said Woock, 36, who lives in Illinois.",
      "Woock said she was with family members when she developed the first migraine of her pregnancy, which occurred mainly during the first three to four months.",
      "Her family told her, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t take anything when you\u2019re pregnant because you\u2019re going to hurt the baby,\u201d Woock recalled. \u201cI was kind of nervous about it, but I decided that my doctor probably knew what she was talking about.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Canadian comic Mae Martin knows their new Netflix limited series \u2014 which blends light-hearted comedic elements with the anxiety-inducing horror and thriller genres \u2014 may feel like a dramatic departure for anyone who is familiar with their stand-up routines and their semi-autobiographical show, \u201cFeel Good.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because it doesn\u2019t feel like a departure for me,\u201d Martin, who identifies as nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, told NBC News. \u201cIt feels thematically in the same universe as everything I do. It\u2019s introspective, and there\u2019s themes about processing adolescence and identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cWayward,\u201d which premieres Thursday, stars Martin as Alex Dempsey, a police officer who has just moved to the seemingly picturesque small town of Tall Pines with his pregnant wife, Laura (Sarah Gadon). During one of his first days in the city, where his wife grew up, Alex crosses paths with two students from the local academy for \u201ctroubled teens\u201d who are desperately trying to plot their escape. As he begins investigating a series of unusual incidents, Alex suspects that Evelyn Wade (Toni Collette) \u2014 the school\u2019s enigmatic leader who shares a troubling personal connection with Laura \u2014 might be at the center of all the town\u2019s problems.",
      "\u201cAlex is sort of the eyes of the audience and trying to piece it all together. It\u2019s so seductive to be in a town that is so accepting and progressive on the surface and is offering him everything he\u2019s always dreamed of,\u201d Martin explained. But over the course of eight episodes, Alex, who is a transgender man, \u201cis grappling with his moral compass and also his intense yearning to have that nuclear family and mainstream acceptance that he\u2019s always wanted.\u201d",
      "After Martin rose to fame internationally during the Covid-19 pandemic for co-creating the romantic dramedy series \u201cFeel Good,\u201d in which they played a fictionalized version of themselves, some viewers may have expected the writer to create a new project that would feel similarly autobiographical. But Martin said they have been wanting to make a show for decades set against the backdrop of the \u201ctroubled teen industry,\u201d a term used for the broad range of controversial youth residential programs aimed at struggling teenagers.",
      "\u201cMy best friend Nicole got sent to a troubled teen institute in the States, and she was gone for about two years,\u201d said Martin, who grew up in Toronto. \u201cThat sparked my interest in some of the shadier practices and the really strange origins of that industry, which all trace back to self-help cults in the 1970s and this really theatrical behavioral modification.\u201d",
      "At first, Martin thought the series would be more of a classic, coming-of-age story in the vein of \u201cStand By Me\u201d or \u201cHoles.\u201d But after hearing about their best friend\u2019s harrowing experiences at one of those unregulated schools \u2014 where she recalled being starved, sleep deprived and forced to dig and stand in her own grave overnight \u2014 Martin could tell that a tale about troubled teens being held against their will would be much more in line with classic horror and thriller films such as \u201cFargo,\u201d \u201cGet Out\u201d and \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby.\u201d",
      "Over time, Martin said, they became more interested in looking \u201cdirectly at how many young people are pathologized at such a young age, just for having a pretty normal reaction to a sick society.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you take kids who are in crisis and your reaction is punitive, you take away their opportunity to go through all the normal milestones of development, and you ascribe labels to them that really affect how they see their own potential,\u201d they said.",
      "Martin said they have found themselves increasingly thinking about \u201cthe state of the world that we\u2019re passing down to young people, and about intergenerational conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs we get older, we suppress so much of our sensitivity and our critical thinking and even our empathy just in order to survive in the world,\u201d Martin said. \u201cSo we can\u2019t help but kind of gaslight young people out of their very correct observation that the world is insane, and that there\u2019s a lot of hypocrisy out there.\u201d",
      "From the outset, Martin said, they knew they wanted to play Alex. While his gender identity is only explored in passing, \u201ca lot of his inner yearning is connected to that and how he sees himself and wants to be seen in the world,\u201d especially as a husband and an expectant father, Martin explained.",
      "\u201cThe show\u2019s set in 2003, and I think there wasn\u2019t a lot of fluency around nonbinary identity then and not a lot of they/thems,\u201d Martin noted, adding that playing a man \u201cjust made sense\u201d to them. \u201cWho knows where I\u2019ll end up on that spectrum? But it felt pretty natural to me as an actor \u2014 more natural than it would\u2019ve been to play a woman.\u201d",
      "As the creator and co-showrunner of \u201cWayward,\u201d Martin is one of the few LGBTQ writers in Hollywood who are shepherding their own mainstream projects. While they said they try not to think too much about their public profile when creating their projects, Martin said it is \u201cscary\u201d to be a queer creative at a time when President Donald Trump and conservatives have been actively targeting and rolling back legal protections for the queer community, especially trans and nonbinary people.",
      "\u201cWhat makes things difficult is when things are charged politically, like they are now, it makes it seem like even having a trans character or a gay character is a political statement and immediately puts your project in a niche category,\u201d said Martin. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that your career can be affected by political swings like that.\u201d",
      "Martin said they see their visibility as a prominent nonbinary comedian in the current climate as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they want to tell stories that will reach the widest audience possible and, hopefully, in turn, create more empathy for the LGBTQ community. But at the same time, Martin said, they know that their mere existence can be seen as a kind of political statement.",
      "They said they would welcome an environment where an LGBTQ character\u2019s identity was \u201cjust incidental,\u201d rather than a defining feature of the project, \u201cand the focus is actually on these hugely universal themes and storylines.\u201d",
      "In \u201cWayward,\u201d for instance, \u201cthere are nuances that are specific to the queer experience that I think queer people will pick up on and relate to, but those things are pretty relatable to anyone who\u2019s experienced any kind of otherness,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Martin speculated that the heightened backlash against the trans community is connected to depictions of trans people that have disproportionately focused on transphobia, bigotry and trauma.",
      "\u201cIt is a part of the trans experience, but it\u2019s just one small part of a human experience,\u201d they said. \u201cThe more we can have diverse characters who are flawed, funny, weird and relatable, who make mistakes, who have relationships \u2014 I think that would be more helpful.\u201d",
      "Martin acknowledged there\u2019s been a contraction in the output of diverse stories, but they plan to keep \u201csneaking subversive things\u201d into more mainstream projects.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll just keep my head down, keep inundating people with scripts, and hope to ride it out and do my part,\u201d Martin said."

      "Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, is the subject of a new documentary titled \u201cIn Whose Name?\u201d",
      "The 48-year-old rapper is making headlines again for his documentary, which hit theaters Sept. 19, for the many dramatic confrontations and celebrities who make an appearance in the movie.",
      "\u201cIn Whose Name?\u201d was filmed over six years and follows the ups and downs in Ye\u2019s life over that time period while also touching on his mental health.",
      "\u201cImmersed in Kanye West (Ye\u2019s) world of extremes for 6 years, Nico Ballesteros documented over 3,000 hours, bearing witness to brilliance, breakdowns, triumphs, turmoil, paranoia, and intensity that increasingly shaped Ye\u2019s world,\u201d a description for the film reads on AMC\u2019s website.",
      "The trailer for \u201cIn Whose Name?\u201d opens with Ye saying, \u201cI\u2019m off my meds for five months now and I got a spiritual connection.\u201d He is then seen telling a group of people, \u201cI\u2019m here to take over. Get used to it.\u201d",
      "He appears to have an emotional discussion before closing a door that has ex-wife Kim Kardashian\u2019s name on it. The reality television star is later shown having a conversation with Ye that becomes heated. Kardashian filed for divorce in 2020 and their case was settled nearly two years later in November 2022. They share four children together.",
      "There are glimpses of Ye with their four children, as well as interactions with celebrity acquaintances like Pharrell Williams and the pastor Joel Osteen, before the teaser touches on the rapper\u2019s religion, his strained business relationships and political beliefs.",
      "\u201cThe best thing about being an artist, being bipolar, is anything you do and say is an art piece,\u201d he says as the clip ends.",
      "Find out where to watch \u201cIn Whose Name?\u201d below.",
      "When Was \u2018In Whose Name?\u2019 Released?",
      "\u201cIn Whose Name?\u201d arrived in select theaters on Sept. 19. Billboard reports that the movie is being shown in about 1,000 theaters across the U.S.",
      "Where to Watch \u2018In Whose Name?\u2019",
      "Tickets for the film are available through Fandango, AMC, Regal and Cinemark, according to the documentary\u2019s website.",
      "Is 'In Whose Name?' Streaming?",
      "The documentary is not currently streaming. TODAY.com has reached out for comment.",
      "What Critics Have Said About \u2018In Whose Name?'",
      "So far, \u201cIn Whose Name\u201d has received somewhat mixed reviews from critics.",
      "Variety\u2019s Steven J. Horowitz wrote, \u201cOn its face, the doc maintains its momentum merely based on access \u2014 one might wonder why Ballesteros, who was 18 years old when he started filming, was permitted to shadow him \u2014 yet the film as a whole is as tedious and frustrating as West himself, a figure who is so deeply certain of his opinions yet wildly unmoored.\u201d",
      "The New York Times\u2019 critic Nicolas Rapold was slightly more favorable. \u201cBallesteros, who started the project when he was 18 years old, does his best to portray a reflexive iconoclast without excusing the inexcusable,\u201d he said.",
      "Andrew Lawrence, a critic for The Guardian, rated the documentary four out of five stars. \u201cIt was a refreshing reminder of who Ye once was: a totally unlikely pop star whose transcendent music spoke to a generation of poor and middle-class strivers. And while 'In Whose Name?,' the most compelling of the Ye career autopsies by far, offers a more complete picture of where and how it all went so wrong, it doesn\u2019t leave you feeling any less frustrated with the few new answers it manages to get,\u201d he wrote."

    "summary": "SenLinYu's debut novel \"Alchemised\" is officially here. What is Alchemised and how does it connect to the popular fan fiction Manacled?",
    "story": [
      "SenLinYu's debut novel \"Alchemised\" is officially here, a publishing journey nearly seven years in the making.",
      "Like many popular books, \"Alchemised\" has its roots in fan fiction. But unlike many, the \"Harry Potter\" fan fiction that inspired it all was a mega hit in its own right.",
      "\"Manacled,\" written by an author who goes by SenLinYu, was a more than 370,000-word story that was first published on Archive of Our Own, an open source fan fiction hub, in 2018. The story had more than 84,000 likes on the site, as well at least 71,000 ratings on Goodreads. And in bookish corners of the internet like BookTok, #Manacled has racked up hundreds of thousands of views.",
      "The dark fantasy story reimagines an ending to \"Harry Potter\" in which Harry Potter was killed and the big bad villain Voldemort won the war. Caught in the crosshairs are Hermione Granger, a healer and spy, and Draco Malfoy, one of Voldemort's most loyal and deadly soldiers. In the original novels by J.K. Rowling, while Hermione romantically ends up with sidekick Ron Weasley, \"Manacled\" imagines an enemies-to-lovers between Hermione and Draco.",
      "Fast forward February 2024. Sen announced on Tumblr that they had signed a book deal for their debut novel \"Alchemised,\" describing it as \"a standalone dark fantasy set in a war-torn world of necromancy and alchemy.\"",
      "In their post, they confirmed \"Alchemised\" will be \"a reimagined version of 'Manacled.'\"",
      "\"Alchemised\" officially hit shelves on Sept. 23. The film rights were also sold this month, the author confirmed in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. Here's what to know about SenLinYu's debut novel and how it relates to \"Manacled.\"",
      "What Is 'Manacled' About?",
      "\"Manacled\" opens with a dark alternate ending to the original plot of the \"Harry Potter\" books and movies. The first scene sees Hermione held captive in darkness for an indeterminate amount of time. It's later revealed that she's been imprisoned for years after the bloody end of the war. Harry Potter and her allies are long dead, and Lord Voldemort has established a totalitarian regime.",
      "Hermione soon realizes she's missing years worth of memories. As one of the final members of the Order of the Phoenix, Voldemort tries to extract any intel she may have, but he fails, as the memories are concealed even to herself.",
      "The story then takes inspiration from \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" After the devastation of the war, the government seeks to repopulate the wizarding world, and Hermione is forced into a surrogacy program. She's assigned to be a surrogate for the High Reeve, one of the most senior operatives in Voldemort's army, eventually revealed to be Hermione's old school nemesis, Draco Malfoy.",
      "The fan fiction is firmly for mature audiences, with dark themes and trigger warnings including non-consensual sex, graphic violence and psychological torture.",
      "As Hermione tries to resurface her memories and survive in Draco's manor, she realizes why they were concealed in the first place. The narrative eventually introduces a collection of flashbacks, which force Hermione to rethink everything she thought she knew about the war and her role in it.",
      "How To Read 'Manacled'",
      "While \"Manacled\" was originally free to read on AO3, it was officially removed from the platform at the end of 2024, prior to the release of \"Alchemised.\"",
      "At present, there's no way to read \"Manacled\" unless a reader had downloaded it from AO3 prior to its removal.",
      "\"People are being given lots of time to save a copy,\u201d Sen told TODAY.com in an interview in February 2024. \u201cSo if they want that version, if that\u2019s the version that\u2019s the most special to them, they are welcome to keep that. \u2026 But this is sort of my way of taking ownership back.\u201d",
      "Do You Have to Read 'Manacled' Before Reading 'Alchemised'?",
      "No, you do not have to have read \"Manacled\" to appreciate \"Alchemised.\"",
      "Sen emphatically made this point with a post to their Instagram story on Sept. 20.",
      "\"Stop telling people that it's necessary to read Manacled before reading Alchemised,\" they wrote in all-caps, later adding, \"people making this claim have not read both and are speaking from a place of zero authority.\"",
      "\"There's been an absolutely massive explosion in illegal sales and listings because of this,\" they concluded.",
      "In their initial announcement of \"Alchemised,\" Sen said part of the of the goal in reimagining \"Manacled\" was to combat illegal sales of the fan fiction.",
      "They previously told TODAY.com that \"Alchemised\" was mostly being written for new readers.",
      "\u201cThe priority is to try to tell a similarly moving story, but to people that haven\u2019t already experienced it once,\" Sen said at the time.",
      "What To Expect From 'Alchemised'",
      "\"Alchemised,\" like \"Manacled,\" will spotlight a rebel healer with amnesia who's sent to live with her world's High Reeve. And like \"Manacled,\" it's a massive story, clocking in at 1,040 pages.",
      "But the rest of the story will introduce readers to a brand new world, brand new characters and a brand new magic system.",
      "Read the full synopsis here:",
      "\u201cWhat is it you think you\u2019re protecting in that brain of yours? The war is over. Holdfast is dead. The Eternal Flame extinguished. There\u2019s no one left for you to save.\u201d",
      "Once a promising alchemist, Helena Marino is now a prisoner \u2014 of war and of her own mind. Her Resistance friends and allies have been brutally murdered, her abilities suppressed, and the world she knew destroyed.",
      "In the aftermath of a long war, Paladia\u2019s new ruling class of corrupt guild families and depraved necromancers, whose vile undead creatures helped bring about their victory, holds Helena captive.",
      "According to Resistance records, she was a healer of little importance within their ranks. But Helena has inexplicable memory loss of the months leading up to her capture, making her enemies wonder: Is she truly as insignificant as she appears, or are her lost memories hiding some vital piece of the Resistance\u2019s final gambit?",
      "To uncover the memories buried deep within her mind, Helena is sent to the High Reeve, one of the most powerful and ruthless necromancers in this new world. Trapped on his crumbling estate, Helena\u2019s fight \u2014 to protect her lost history and to preserve the last remaining shreds of her former self \u2014 is just beginning. For her prison and captor have secrets of their own ... secrets Helena must unearth, whatever the cost."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s weird, I almost conjured it. I was talking to a writer friend of mine, and he\u2019s like, \u2018You\u2019ve never played a cop. Maybe we should write a show for you where you play a cop.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018That\u2019s an interesting idea.\u2019 And then out of nowhere, this job offer came,\u201d she said.",

      "The NBC singing competition show will kick off the season with a two-part premiere on Monday, Sept. 22 and Tuesday, Sept. 23, where fans will see the Blind Auditions begin. In case you aren\u2019t familiar, the Blind Auditions stage \u2014 the first round of the show \u2014 introduces viewers to all the potential contestants hoping to land a spot on one of the four teams led by the celebrity coaches. The contestants perform to the back of the coaches\u2019 chairs, and if one of them is interested then they will press their button and turn around.",
      "This season, the coaches are Michael Bubl\u00e9, Niall Horan, Reba McEntire and Snoop Dogg, who have all been coaches in past seasons of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d They\u2019ll be joined by host Carson Daly, who has hosted the show since it debuted in 2011.",

We\u2019re all competitive,\u201d Bubl\u00e9 shared in a press junket interview before the premiere. \u201cBut I think the win is the four of us being part of producing something that brings light. That\u2019s the gig.\u201d",
      "Horan briefly stepped away from the show after being a coach on Seasons 23 and 24, where he scored back-to-back wins with Gina Miles and Huntley. Let\u2019s see if third time\u2019s the charm for the One Direction alum.",

In any other situation, they would be friends,\u201d Frances, who has worked in TV for 20 years, tells TODAY.com.",

Cherry met Daniel (Laurie Davidson) at the real estate agency where she works after they made eyes at each other passing by on the street.

      "Both arguably tragic, the book ends differently than the series. Below, we speak to Frances in more detail about the series, its inspiration and what could have been.",
      "The Inspiration for \u2018The Girlfriend\u2019",
      "Frances, who works in TV production, says her debut novel had two origins: one going back to her own experiences and another from a story she\u2019d heard.",
      "\u201cI had a friend who needed to get a job to pay the bills, and so she went to work in an estate agent in a really nice part of London. Anyway, in comes a young man. They hit it off. Start dating. Year later, she\u2019s walking up the aisle, and her wedding present from her new in-laws is a seven-bedroom house with a swimming pool,\u201d Frances recalls, laughing.",

      "\u201cShe\u2019s sort of caught in a circle of poverty that she wants to break out of, but she\u2019s smart and she\u2019s ambitious and she\u2019s romantic,\u201d she says.",
      "Then, Frances thought back to her own life. Like Cherry, she was unable to attend university because of high fees. She watched as other classmates, who hadn\u2019t done as well in school, moved forward.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of being told to stay in my lane,\u201d Frances summarizes of Cherry's thinking.",
      "Could Laura Ever Have Been a Good Mother-in-Law?",
      "A turning point in \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d comes when Laura makes up a lie to try and get rid of Cherry for good. After Daniel gets into an accident, she tells Cherry he\u2019s died, but he\u2019s actually on the mend.",
      "Was she destined to despise the woman Daniel brought home? Frances, who was raising her young children while she was writing \u201cThe Girlfriend,\u201d thinks Laura would \u201calways find fault\u201d with a potential romantic partner.",
      "But \u201cshe probably would have been more accepting with some people who played the game a little bit differently,\u201d Frances says. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly an essence of snobbery about Laura, not necessarily from where Cherry comes from, that because she lies about where she comes from.\u201d",
      "She thinks Laura\u2019s personality is a result of the loss of her daughter, Rose. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s looking for a Rose replacement\u201d in a daughter-in-law, she says.",

      "In both, Cherry, Daniel and Laura gather for a showdown at Laura\u2019s house. Laura is trying to convince Daniel that his girlfriend is dangerous and has some compelling evidence. (Her actions in the book are especially gruesome and involve killing a puppy \u2014 seriously).",
      "Frances knew, while writing, one of them wasn\u2019t going to make it out alive, but she didn\u2019t know who.",
      "\u201cIt was really interesting, because it could have been any one of the three,\u201d she says. \u201cAs I wrote it, I did not know. I was just kind of playing out, playing out and seeing what happened on the pages.\u201d",
      "Laura emerges victorious in the book. Cherry charges at her and Laura steps out of the way, but also subtly pushes her out the window.",
      "The ending is far different in the show, and the changes were star, director and executive producer Wright\u2019s idea. After seeing Laura and Cherry wrestling in Laura\u2019s home pool, Daniel jumps in and drowns his own mother. This leaves Cherry alive, and after a one-year time jump, viewers see she's pregnant with Daniel\u2019s baby at the end of the series.",

      "Frances says the calculation also had to do with the potential continuation of the story (which, as of the writing of this article, has not been renewed).",
      "\u201cWell, if you have a Series 2, how\u2019s that going to work? If we have a series, you\u2019re thinking, 'OK, which one of these do you want to keep alive the most?'\u201d she says.",

      "The question hanging over an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday is how exactly the alliance will respond.",
      "As NATO struggles to turn alarm into action, officials and analysts urged a more forceful response and warned that hesitation risks emboldening  Russian President Vladimir Putin. But questions about U.S. support, escalation risks and what this growing threat means for Ukraine remain unresolved.",
      "Estonia, which called for the Security Council meeting after three Russian MiG-31 fighter aircraft entered its airspace for 12 minutes without permission last week, pressed members to address what it described as a \u201cblatant, reckless, and flagrant violation of NATO airspace\u201d and Russia\u2019s \u201crepeated violations of international law.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s actions \u201cundermine principles vital to the security of all U.N. member states,\u201d Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said Sunday on X.",
      "Claims that Russia violated Estonian airspace were \"baseless\" and \"aimed at escalating tensions,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, adding that Russia operated within international regulations.",
      "So far, NATO\u2019s response has largely been limited to meeting rooms as Moscow's probing exposes a contrast between European leaders\u2019 urgent calls for action and President Donald Trump\u2019s more muted response.",
      "Asked by reporters Sunday whether Washington would come to the defense of Poland and the Baltic states if Russia attacks, Trump said: \"Yeah I would.\"",
      "And on Monday Mike Walz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said at Security Council meeting that the events left \u201cthe impression either Russia wants to escalate or doesn\u2019t have full control of its fighter planes and drones.\u201d Either scenario, he said, was \u201cvery disconcerting.\u201d",
      "The U.S. \u201cwill defend every inch of NATO territory,\u201d he said, adding that he expected \u201cRussia to seek ways to de escalate, not risk expansion.\u201d",
      "At the same meeting, Britain\u2019s foreign minister, Yvette Cooper, also warned that Russia\u2019s incursions into NATO territory risked triggering an armed conflict.",

Our alliance is defensive, but be under no illusion: We stand ready to defend NATO\u2019s skies and NATO\u2019s territory,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we need to confront planes operating in NATO space without permission then we will do so.\u201d",
      "That drew an immediate rebuke from Moscow, which dismissed Europe\u2019s concerns as groundless and hysterical.",
      "NATO's response to this ratcheting Russian activity amounts to the launch of operation \"Eastern Sentry\" earlier this month to bolster the defense of Europe\u2019s eastern flank in response to a series of Russian drone incursions over Poland.",
      "After Germany and Sweden scrambled fighter jets Sunday to intercept and track a Russian surveillance plane flying unidentified over the Baltic Sea, one regional leader said Russia was not just testing NATO\u2019s response, but was also aiming to reduce support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources.",

      "Ukraine has also submitted a request to attend the Security Council meeting and present its position.",
      "But Europe's security will require decisive action, and that will not happen at a Security Council meeting, \u201cfor the very simple reason that Russia has a veto on the council,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank",
      "Unable to rely on Trump\u2019s \u201cshifting position\u201d on Russia, Giles told NBC News, the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 European nations that say they are prepared to underwrite security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 must become the \u201ccoalition of the able and actually doing something.\u201d",
      "Poland will not hesitate to shoot down objects that violate its airspace and pose a threat, its prime minister said Monday. But, he said, his country would take a more cautious approach when dealing with situations that are less clear-cut, and would need to know it had its allies' support.",

      "As an example, he pointed to 2015, when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane seconds after it violated the country\u2019s airspace near the Syrian border. Moscow did not retaliate militarily.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has said he hopes to see Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan returned to U.S. control, suggesting a renewed American presence in the country now again ruled by the Taliban.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said of Bagram during a news conference Thursday alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that capped a whirlwind state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Taking aim at the Biden administration's fraught withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as a \"total disaster,\" Trump criticized the decision to relinquish Bagram Airfield, which quickly fell under the control of the Taliban as they swept back into power in 2021.",
      "\"We gave it to them for nothing,\" said Trump, who has long criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"We want that base back,\" he said.",
      "About an hour's drive north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, Bagram served for years as a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At its peak around 2012, the sprawling airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its compound.",
      "Late Thursday, Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Afghan Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of Bagram returning to the U.S.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan and the U.S. need to interact with each other and can have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and common interests,\u201d Jalaly said on the social platform X. \u201cThe Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the door is open for further interaction.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear at least one motivating factor for his interest in reclaiming Bagram, noting its proximity to rival superpower China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said during his comments Thursday, which came a day before he was spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade negotiations.",
      "Addressing journalists later on Air Force One, Trump said Bagram was \"one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,\" adding: \"You could land anything there.\" He emphasized again that the base was \"an hour away from where they make their missiles \u2014 China.\"",
      "Addressing Trump's comments Friday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China \"respects Afghanistan\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.",
      "\"Afghanistan\u2019s future should be decided by its own people,\" Lin said, adding: \"Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won\u2019t be popular.\"",
      "China, which has made strides in rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile, is estimated to have accumulated about 600 warheads, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "Of course, greater surveillance on China wouldn't be the only advantage to regaining Bagram.",
      "A presence at the base could also aid in regional counterterrorism efforts, among other factors that could appeal to Trump.",
      "It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the U.S. has been in talks with the Taliban on the future of Bagram.",
      "\u201cEven if the Taliban considered this, China most certainly would do everything it can to entice the Taliban to keep the U.S. out of Afghanistan and has far more leverage and enticements to make this happen,\" Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, cautioned in comments shared online Thursday.",
      "\"The Trump administration should be very careful not to grant the Taliban concessions only to be prevented access to Bagram in the end,\" he said.",
      "The Taliban have been working to rehabilitate their global standing, with the militant group freeing American George Glezmann, a Delta Air Lines mechanic, in March amid efforts to normalize relations between Afghanistan and the U.S.",
      "On Friday, the Taliban also released British couple Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband, Peter Reynolds, 80, who were detained by the Interior Ministry in February, according to Sky News, NBC News' sister outlet in the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump's comments came as the Pentagon continues to push ahead with a review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed at Kabul's airport in a bombing by the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "Trump, who began the process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during his first term, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration's handling of the drawdown.",
      "The White House under President Joe Biden largely blamed the Trump administration for the chaotic withdrawal, with a National Security Council report released in 2023 arguing that Biden's options for executing the operation were \"severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor.\""

    "summary": "A message from first Czech President Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk was sealed in an envelope before his death in 1937 and unveiled in a live broadcast Friday.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cIt is the end, but I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d",
      "That's the message delivered Friday to a nation on tenterhooks, sealed for nearly a century inside an envelope thought to carry its founding father's final words.",
      "The words of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk \u2014 the first president of an independent Czechoslovakia, which has since split into Czechia and Slovakia \u2014 were unveiled in a live broadcast attended by current Czech President Petr Pavel.",
      "Speculation had gone into overdrive prior to the announcement, with experts wondering whether Masaryk may have conveyed a fateful warning before Europe's descent back into war. His words are believed to have been dictated to his son Jan, surviving both World War II and subsequent communist rule.",
      "Jan\u2019s former secretary handed the envelope to the National Archives in 2005 on the condition that it not be opened for another 20 years.",
      "Even the Masaryk family did not know what mystery the white envelope contained. But when it was opened early Friday, it still managed to surprise.",
      "Inside was another yellow envelope, containing five pages of handwritten notes in Czech and English (Masaryk's wife, Charlotte Garrigue, was born in the United States.)",
      "Rather than a final message before his death in 1937, experts assessed that the message was instead dictated three years earlier.",
      "\u201cI am ill, seriously ill \u2014 it is the end, but I am not afraid. You will continue the work, you know how, but you must be careful. You know how to behave; I don\u2019t need to tell you anything more,\u201d the letter read, according to the country's official broadcaster.",
      "At the time, Masaryk was gravely ill after a stroke, and those around him thought his days were numbered.",
      "Masaryk became the first president of Czechoslovakia in 1918 after it declared independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was defeated in World War I. He served until 1935. Jan became foreign minister at the end of World War II, until his sudden death in 1948.",
      "In the envelope, Masaryk talked extensively about his death and subsequent funeral and reflected on the complex political situation in the ethnically diverse country.",
      "As well as derisive comments about a Slovak politician, he urged keeping the German minority part of the state. \u201cGive them what they deserve, but no more,\u201d he said of the Germans, according to the state broadcaster.",
      "\u201c[This was a] crucial time in Czechoslovakia with Hitler just coming to power in Germany,\u201d said Mark Cornwall, an emeritus professor of modern European history at the University of Southampton in England.",
      "\u201cIt was a very turbulent period in Europe about what was going to happen,\u201d said Cornwall, nodding to the Nazis' subsequent annexation of the Sudetenland, a Czech region that had a significant German-speaking population, and the later outbreak of World War II.",
      "\u201cMasaryk is still very revered\u201d in the country, Cornwall told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an American equivalent. Perhaps he\u2019s George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.\u201d"

      "The World Health Organization said that \u201cthe evidence remains inconsistent\u201d regarding any link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and autism.",
      "WHO spokesperson Tarik Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 cited unspecified studies that pointed to a possible link but said that this was not confirmed by subsequent research. \u201cThis lack of replicability really calls for caution in drawing casual conclusions,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump on Monday also suggested that additives in vaccines may cause autism, which the WHO was similarly quick to dispute.",
      "\u201cWe know that vaccines do not cause autism. Vaccines, as I said, save countless lives. So, this is something that science has proven, and these things should not be really questioned,\u201d Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 told a Geneva press briefing.",
      "Australian health officials were among the first to reject the claims, labeling them \u201ca misrepresentation of the science.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, together with the country\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, said Tuesday that it was joining other global medicines regulators in repudiating Trump\u2019s claims.",
      "\u201cRobust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims,\u201d they said in a statement.",

      "A spokesperson for the German Health Ministry told NBC News that there was no link between taking paracetamol during pregnancy and developmental abnormalities. \"In certain situations, taking medication is necessary to avoid endangering the mother and unborn child, for example in the case of high fever,\" they said in an emailed statement.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s health regulator, MHRA, issued a similar statement, stressing that \u201cparacetamol remains the recommended pain relief option for pregnant women when used as directed.\u201d",
      "\u201cUntreated pain and fever can pose risks to the unborn baby, so it is important to manage these symptoms with the recommended treatment,\u201d Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said in a statement on the agency\u2019s website.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting told ITV early Tuesday: \u201cI would just say to people watching, don\u2019t pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine.\u201d",
      "Spain\u2019s health minister, M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez, also called out Trump by name, accusing him of \u201cignoring all medical studies.\u201d",

      "Scott White, chair of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Women\u2019s Health Committee, said he was \"worried\" about the messaging from the U.S.",
      "\u201cParacetamol is safe and actually important to use because pain and fever are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes themselves,\u201d White told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really worried about the messaging that says pregnant women should just tough it out, that pregnant women should be denied access to pain relief, which is a fundamental human right. It\u2019s every woman\u2019s right,\u201d White said.",
      "\u201cTo suggest that women can\u2019t access a medication that we feel has been shown to be safe simply because they\u2019re pregnant women, is misogynistic.\u201d",
      "White cited a study published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association that studied 2.5 million children in Sweden. It compared siblings and found no association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability.",
      "While other studies have suggested some kind of link, including research published last month that Trump administration officials are citing, White argues many struggled to exclude factors like genetics or environment.",
      "Outside autism researchers have said that literature review, by researchers from Harvard and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, wasn\u2019t rigorously conducted and that it cherry-picked studies that supported its conclusion.",
      "White also said the reason a woman is taking paracetamol, such as to treat a fever or infection, could be what affects the mental development of the child.",
      "\u201cWe know that women who\u2019ve got complicated pregnancies in some way are more likely to go on to have babies that are neurodevelopmentally impacted,\u201d he added, citing fever as a prime example."

      "The email was published in two newspapers Sunday. It was sent by the duchess \u2014 the former wife of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York \u2014 in 2011, just weeks after she had publicly distanced herself from Epstein.",
      "A spokesperson for the duchess said the email was sent to counter a threat Epstein had made to sue her for defamation.",

      "A series of unprecedented Russian incursions into NATO members' airspace in recent weeks has raised the alarm across Europe, which is looking towards an emboldened Kremlin for clues to its intentions and next moves.",
      "The incidents have also exposed a contrast between European leaders' urgent calls for action and President Donald Trump's more muted response, as he continues to hold back on imposing additional sanctions on Moscow as its war on Ukraine rages on.",
      "On Friday, for the second time in 10 days, a NATO ally invoked Article 4 following airspace violations linked to Russia \u2014 a mechanism that prompts urgent talks among allies and that had only been triggered seven times in its 76-year history before this month.",
      "Earlier in the day, three MiG-31 fighter aircraft entered Estonian airspace without permission and remained there for a total of 12 minutes, according to the country's Ministry of Defense. NATO aircraft intercepted the jets, the military alliance\u2019s spokesperson Allison Hart said.",

      "While European leaders have responded with urgency, signaling deep concern and pushing for stronger measures on Moscow amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, President Donald Trump has struck a more restrained note as he continues to hold back on imposing further sanctions on the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t love it,\u201d Trump said Friday on the latest incursion. \u201cI don\u2019t like when that happens. Could be big trouble.\u201d",

      "Estonia and the United States are members of NATO, which at its core is a mutual defense pact formed after World War II to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union, meaning an attack on one may be considered an attack on all.",

      "His acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dorothy Shea, sought to reassure allies. Violating the airspace of a U.S. ally, \u201cintentionally or otherwise,\u201d showed \u201cimmense disrespect for good-faith U.S. efforts to bring an end to this conflict,\u201d she told the U.N. Security Council.",

    "story": [
      "Perhaps the Eurovision ban is starting to bite, because three years after Russia was booted from the beloved song contest following the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
      "The Intervision Song Contest will see 23 artists from around the world \u2014 including one representing the U.S. \u2014 offer a heady mix of musical styles, from moody Belarusian pop to Colombian folk and high-energy Vietnamese rap at an arena in the capital of Moscow on Saturday night.",
      "Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest, which mainly includes European countries and a few others like Australia and Israel, Intervision bills itself as a truly global event by offering artists from countries around the world, including those in the Global South, a chance to compete for the top prize of 30 million rubles (roughly $360,000).",
      "\u201cBack in the Soviet times, the government would decide to promote a positive image of Russia abroad. We need to promote an objective image. We want to be known with all our merits and shortcomings,\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a news conference this week in response to a presubmitted question from NBC News.",
      "Asked whether Russia was using the competition as an exercise in soft power, he replied, \u201cIf by soft power you mean the opportunity to let people know about us, then of course we\u2019re interested in this.\u201d",
      "A pop phenomenon drawing around 160 million viewers each May, Eurovision began at the height of the Cold War in 1956 as a technical experiment to try and broadcast a simultaneous program across the member stations of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).",
      "A divided continent had mirror organizations like the NATO defense alliance in Western Europe and the Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe, and the EBU in the West matched by the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) on the other side of the Iron Curtain.",
      "In answer to Eurovision came Intervision, which was broadcast by the OIRT on several occasions between 1965 and 1980, with contests held in what was then Czechoslovakia and later in Poland.",
      "But Dean Vuletic, who has written and edited books on Eurovision and led a research project on Intervision, says Russia is getting its history wrong with the relaunch, \u201cpresenting Intervision as something that was Russian- or Soviet-led, but it actually wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said, the competitions \u201cweren\u2019t that focused on the Soviet participants,\u201d although they had to be invited. Having studied the archives of Czech and Polish TV stations, he said it was \u201castonishing how critical they are of the Soviet participants.\u201d",
      "He added that it was actually created during a period of liberalization in an attempt \u201cto promote East-West cooperation in popular music and television,\u201d and Western performers like Gloria Gaynor were invited to perform in the intervals. Performers from Eastern Europe were also hoping to be signed by Western labels, he added.",
      "Before it was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia was frequently a top-10 finalist at Eurovision, which Vuletic called \u201ca huge platform for cultural diplomacy for any country,\u201d big or small.",
      "The country\u2019s leaders \u201csaw it as a very prestigious cultural project and one which could reach a huge amount of people,\u201d he added.",
      "But Eurovision\u2019s embrace of LGBTQ rights drew the ire of conservative Russian lawmakers and the country\u2019s Orthodox Church, particularly after the 2014 victory of bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst.",
      "Saturday\u2019s Intervision contest is getting a full-court press promotion from organizers, who have drafted a series of celebrity \u201cambassadors\u201d to get the word out. Among them are Dima Bilan, a Russian singer who won Eurovision in 2008, and Alexander Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals hockey star, who holds the record for most goals scored in NHL history.",
      "The goal is to \u201cpromote universal, spiritual, family, cultural, ethical, and religious traditions of different nations,\u201d according to the competition\u2019s website, although that seems potentially at odds with the entrant representing the U.S., Vassy, who has a history of performing at Pride events and supporting LGBTQ rights.",
      "Vassy, an Australian-born singer living in Los Angeles, has been a vocalist on dance tracks from David Guetta and Ti\u00ebsto, while several of her own topped Billboard\u2019s Dance Club Songs chart in the 2010s.",
      "The 42-year-old, whose real name is Vasiliki Karagiorgos, was a last-minute addition to the contest after the previous selection pulled out due to \u201cunforeseen family circumstances.\u201d",
      "Her outlook is markedly different from that of Russia\u2019s entrant, Shaman, who mixes politics and pop and rose in popularity after he became a strident supporter of the war in Ukraine.",
      "So vocal is his backing of the Kremlin that he has ended up on Australian and European Union sanction lists.",
      "Russia will be hoping that Shaman\u2019s popularity can bring a younger audience to the contest as well as his fans, many of whom are based outside major Russian metropolises like Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to Yulia Yurtaeva-Martens, a researcher at the Free University of Berlin who has written a book on Intervision.",
      "With his fulsome embrace of Russian nationalism in his music and performances, Shaman is viewed by the government as \u201ca new political symbol for new audiences,\u201d according to Yurtaeva-Martens, adding that it was unlikely they would have chosen anyone else because he \u201cwas the best choice for the Russian government.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Kenya\u2019s Sanaipei Tande is competing with her song \u201cFlavour,\u201d an Afropop tune that mixes English and Kiswahili.",

      "For artists who may have had success at home, performing at Intervision is a chance to step onto a larger stage, she said. In her case, this is both metaphorically and literally true because \u201cthe live arena is so huge.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any stage in my country that\u2019s this big,\u201d she said, adding that coming to the Russian capital \u201cto compete against other international artists \u2014 that, for me, has put me on a whole new level.\u201d",
      "The fact she had been selected and was representing Kenya was a victory in itself, she said.",
      "\u201cI mean, $300,000 wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to add on to that,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut just being here and being able to perform on this stage and experiencing things on a whole new level, that already is a win.\u201d"

      "Trump summarized their conversation, which he said began at 8 a.m. ET, in a Truth Social post in which he said he appreciates \u201cthe TikTok approval,\u201d but stopped short of announcing any kind of finalized deal. As expected, the call also appeared to touch on the ongoing trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "\u201cI just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\u201d Trump wrote.",

      "The White House is not disputing the characterization that there is no final TikTok deal. An announcement on a final deal would ultimately come from the president, a White House official said.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon, Trump offered some mixed messages on the status of TikTok talks. He said Xi \"approved the TikTok deal,\" and then said \"we look forward to getting that deal closed.\"",
      "Asked directly if the deal was fully approved, Trump said, \"Well, I think so. I mean \u2014 when you say fully approved, I don\u2019t know what that means. We have to get, we have to get it signed. I guess it could be a formality.\"",

Since then they have been lowered under another \u201cframework\u201d deal, with new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods capped at 30%, while China imposes a 10% additional tariff on U.S. goods.",

      "Trump has gone back and forth on the ban, but he credits TikTok with helping him win last year\u2019s presidential election and has expressed concern about alienating its huge and youthful user base. He said Thursday during a visit to the U.K. that the app \u201chas tremendous value\u201d and that \u201cvery rich people and companies are going to be owning it.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have said the TikTok sale is necessary because of Chinese laws that require Chinese companies to share data requested by the government. They also cite concerns about data collection and the algorithm the app uses to recommend content to users, which they say is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese officials.",
      "TikTok denies sharing user data with Chinese authorities and says the U.S. has never provided evidence of Beijing trying to manipulate the algorithm.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance say the powerful algorithm, which has helped fuel the app\u2019s global success, is proprietary and thus difficult to sell to a U.S. company under Chinese law.",
      "There are concerns that TikTok may continue to use the Chinese algorithm in the U.S.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., the committee\u2019s ranking member, have both expressed opposition to any deal that keeps the algorithm under Chinese control or allows ByteDance to maintain an operational relationship with the new American TikTok.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has all the leverage he needs to strike a deal that saves TikTok and complies with the law \u2014 which means making sure TikTok\u2019s data and algorithm are truly in American hands,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Any deal would most likely need to be approved by Congress as well as ByteDance\u2019s board.",
      "Compared with five years ago, when Trump first called for a ban during his first term, TikTok is more mature as a platform and less likely to keep growing, said Dimitar Gueorguiev, an associate professor of political science and director of Chinese studies at Syracuse University.",
      "\u201cTikTok is, I think, a less valuable bargaining chip from the Chinese perspective, and an easier concession,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, for the United States, it\u2019s as visible and kind of politically salient as ever.\u201d",
      "While the details of the TikTok deal remain unclear, Gueorguiev said, the broader question is \u201ccan the Trump administration, as well as their counterparts in Beijing, convert on whatever progress we observe today and keep it going\u201d to achieve a \u201clarger bargain\u201d between the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re thinking about what is the ultimate outcome of this, and who wins and who loses, there\u2019s still a lot to be told,\u201d he said."
