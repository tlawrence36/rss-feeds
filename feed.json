      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Kathryn Bigelow tackles geopolitics in her new film \u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d which has its world premiere on Tuesday at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "The film is about an imminent missile strike on the U.S., from an unknown aggressor, and how the White House responds.",
      "\u201cI grew up in an era when hiding under your school desk was considered the go-to protocol for surviving an atomic bomb,\u201d Bigelow said in her director\u2019s statement. \u201cToday, the danger has only escalated. Multiple nations possess enough nuclear weapons to end civilization within minutes. And yet, there\u2019s a kind of collective numbness \u2014 a quiet normalization of the unthinkable.\u201d",
      "She added that she wanted to make a film that confronts this paradox \u2014 \u201cto explore the madness of a world that lives under the constant shadow of annihilation, yet rarely speaks of it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s Bigelow\u2019s first film since the 2017 release of \u201cDetroit.\u201d Her most acclaimed films have been politically themed, from \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d for which she became the first woman to win the best director Oscar, to \u201cZero Dark Thirty.\u201d",
      "\u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d was written by former NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, who won best screenplay at the festival for \u201cJackie\u201d in 2016.",
      "\u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d is one of three Netflix films playing in competition, alongside Guillermo del Toro\u2019s classically gothic \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Noah Baumbach\u2019s Hollywood drama \u201cJay Kelly.\u201d The streamer still doesn't have a best picture win in its arsenal, and Venice has proved itself to be a solid launching pad for awards hopefuls.",

      "\u201cKokuho,\u201d which means \u201cnational treasure,\u201d has already grossed more than 10 billion yen ($68 million), making it the second-highest grossing Japanese live-action film of all time, and the first to achieve that in more than two decades.",
      "It stars heartthrobs Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama who portray longtime rivals and soulmates. They are both Kabuki \u201connagata\u201d actors, meaning they specialize in women roles, from gorgeous princesses to damsels in distress.",
      "They look stunning, and convincing, having gone through months of training with a real Kabuki actor.",

      "The plot of \u201cKokuho\u201d \u2014 pronounced Koh-koo-hoe \u2014 explores perennial themes of family and the grueling hardships of being an artist, set to the backdrop of the intense but dreamlike life of the Kabuki actor.",
      "It also pays homage to old-style yakuza movies, as well as obliquely to Western gangster films, like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d because one of the heroes is the son of a gangster.",
      "In short, it\u2019s not the kind of material that usually makes a hit movie in Japan, where action-packed blockbusters or animation based on popular manga comics or spectacular special effects have drawn audiences in the past.",
      "But the movie\u2019s theme explores something intrinsically Japanese and hit a raw nerve in a country where soul-searching about national pride is on the rise amid a widespread perception that economic and political clout is on the decline.",
      "Being an outsider was the theme that jumped out for tourism science scholar Yosuke Kon.",
      "\u201cThe Kabuki world seems very special, but a Kabuki kind of mentality exists in many places in Japan,\u201d he told The Associated Press, noting a closed mentality is prevalent in the village, as well as local governments he has worked with.",
      "\u201cMany people can relate to the film,\u201d he added.",
      "The film is dominated by stage scenes from Kabuki, an art form dating to the 17th century, which combines stylized dance and acting to live music. It\u2019s been stereotyped as catering to old people, as younger generations turn to Western and modern forms of entertainment like boys\u2019 bands, baseball games and streaming services.",
      "In Kabuki, all the roles are played by men, wearing thick makeup and elaborate kimono, delivering sing-song lines in tales of intrigue and violence set in the samurai era.",
      "The film shows the dazzling esoteric elements of Kabuki, such as the backstage where actors apply makeup with their fingertips, or the flutter of paper snowflakes or flower petals on the stage.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Amsterdam museum that displays a priceless collection of works by one of the world's most popular artists, Vincent van Gogh, may have to close if the Dutch government doesn't help foot the bill for major repairs to its aging building, the museum's director said Thursday.",
      "Since its opening in 1973, nearly 57 million visitors have passed through the Van Gogh Museum to gaze at iconic works including one of his paintings of a vase of sunflowers as well as \u201cAlmond Blossom,\u201d \u201cThe Potato Eaters\u201d and a colorful depiction of his bedroom in the French town of Arles.",
      "But Director Emilie Gordenker says the original building, which is owned by the Dutch state, is in such poor condition it needs urgent and extensive repairs to keep its priceless collection and visitors safe.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t address the major maintenance that needs to happen, we will have to close,\" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. The New York Times first reported on her concerns on Wednesday.",
      "She said the 50-year-old building needs \"major maintenance,\u201d and two years of talks with the government have not resolved a dispute about how to pay for repairs expected to start in 2028, last three years and cost 104 million euros ($121 million).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now getting very urgent,\u201d she said.",
      "She said that during the renovation, the museum would be partly closed and would therefore earn less from ticket sales. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re asking them to do is to help us finance the basic maintenance,\u201d she said.",
      "The nearby Rijksmuseum shut down for years for a largescale renovation, but Gordenker says that kind of major facelift is not what the Van Gogh Museum is appealing for.",

      "The dispute has its origins in a decision by Van Gogh\u2019s family to transfer a trove of his art \u2014 more than 200 paintings, 500 drawings and 900 letters along with works by contemporaries such as Paul Gauguin \u2014 to a foundation set up in 1962 to keep the collection together. In return, the government pledged to build and maintain a museum where the works could be displayed, the museum said in a statement.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- It is rare for a sports broadcasting figure to retire on his own terms or to be able to accept the tributes or adulation of colleagues and fans.",
      "Lee Corso gets to experience that on Saturday.",
      "Corso makes his final appearance as part of ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d crew before No. 3 and reigning national champion Ohio State hosts top-ranked Texas.",
      "Since announcing his retirement earlier this year, Corso has received his share of acclaim and send-offs. He was honored at the ESPY Awards in July and received a standing ovation before boarding his flight in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gamut of different emotions. I\u2019m trying to stay in the celebratory lane this weekend,\u201d said GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit, who has sat next to Corso since 1996. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be emotional or sad when it\u2019s his last show. We can be sad next week. But this weekend, we need to be celebrating him. Everything he\u2019s meant to us and to the sport.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turned 90 on Aug. 7, has been a part of \u201cGameDay\u201d since its start in 1987 and has made pregame shows entertaining under a simple philosophy: \u201cFootball is just the vehicle. It\u2019s entertainment, sweetheart.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlmost everyone, no matter what they accomplish in our industry, sort of gets dragged out boots first. They don\u2019t really get a chance to say farewell,\u201d GameDay host Rece Davis said on Friday after a production meeting. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real blessing that we\u2019re able to give Lee his flowers on a day when he\u2019s feeling great, doing great, and excited for a game.\u201d",
      "GameDay\u2019s 26th appearance in Columbus also marks a full-circle moment for Corso. It was outside Ohio Stadium on Oct. 5, 1996, where Corso\u2019s popular headgear prediction segment began.",
      "Corso donned Brutus Buckeye\u2019s head before Ohio State faced Penn State, and the rest is history.",
      "Corso has worn 69 different schools\u2019 mascot headgear and has dressed up as Notre Dame\u2019s Fighting Irish leprechaun, the Stanford tree, and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. However, Brutus remains Corso\u2019s first love, wearing it 45 times.",
      "\u201cWhen we looked at the schedule, the obvious place was to try to go to Tallahassee, where he played (at Florida State), but this game is so big. The fact that it\u2019s a noon game. It became a no-brainer to have it here,\u201d Herbstreit said. \u201cIt is very kind of storybook. The fact that we started with this and and end it here in Columbus.\u201d",
      "Corso has a 66.5% winning rate on his headgear predictions (286-144), which is much better than his 73-85-6 mark in 15 years as a coach at Louisville, Indiana, and Northern Illinois.",
      "His final headgear pick will be on the field at Ohio Stadium. Besides airing across all of ESPN\u2019s networks, Fox Sports may show part of it. The final hour of both pregame shows will also take place in the Horseshoe.",

What was he going to do? Like that was going to determine who would win the game or not, but that was the beauty of the show, getting people excited about every Saturday for college football.\u201d",

      "\u201cI love what I have because I live with it. I actually am a little nuts, because I say hi to some of the life-size figures when I turn on the light,\u201d del Toro told The Associated Press, sitting in the dining room of one of the houses, now a sanctuary for \u201cHaunted Mansion\u201d memorabilia. \u201cThis is curated. This is not a casual collection.\u201d",
      "The auction includes behind-the-scene drawings and one-of-a-kind props from del Toro\u2019s own classics, as well as iconic works like Bernie Wrightson\u2019s illustrations for \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Mike Mignola\u2019s pinup artwork for \u201cHellraiser.\u201d",
      "In January, del Toro had only a couple hours, his car and a few helping hands to save key pieces from the fires. Out of the over 5,000 items in his collection, he only managed to move about 120 objects. It wasn't the first time, as fires had come dangerously close to Bleak House twice before.",
      "The houses were spared, but fear consumed him. If a fire or earthquake swallowed them, he thought, \u201cWhat came out of it? You collected insurance? And what happened to that little segment of Richard Corben's life, or Jack Kirby\u2019s craft, or Bernie Wrightson\u2019s life?\u201d",
      "An auction, del Toro said, gives him peace of mind, as it ensures the items will land in the hands of another collector who will protect the items as he has. These are not just props or trinkets, he said, but \u201chistorical artifacts. They're pieces of audiovisual history for humanity.\u201d And his life's mission has been to protect as much of this history as he can.",
      "\u201cLook, this is in reaction to the fires. This is in reaction to loving this thing,\u201d del Toro told the AP.",
      "The initial auction uncovers who del Toro is as a collector, he said. Upcoming parts will expose how the filmmaker thinks, which he called a much more personal endeavor. The auction isn't just a \u201cpiece of business,\u201d for him, but rather a love letter to collectors everywhere, and encouragement to think beyond a movie and \u201clearn to read and write film design in a different way. That's my hope.\u201d",

      "The auction will give the filmmaker some breathing room from the collection's arduous maintenance. The houses must stay at a certain temperature, without direct sunlight \u2014 all of which is monitored solely by del Toro, who often spends most of his day there.",
      "He selects the picture frame for every drawing, dusts all the artifacts and arranges every bookshelf mostly himself, having learned his lesson from the handful of times he allowed outside help.

So that\u2019s part of the weight.\"",

      "Kelce, who played football for the Bearcats, spent plenty of time on the field during warm-ups in a red-and-white striped sweater before retreating to a suite for the game. He was joined there by Swift and several others shortly before kickoff.",
      "In a five-photo joint post on Instagram on Tuesday, Kelce and Swift revealed their engagement after a courtship that lasted for about two years. The Chiefs did not make Kelce available to reporters this week, and Swift publicist Tree Paine only confirmed that the engagement ring was an old mine brilliant-cut diamond from Kindred Lubeck.",
      "The Chiefs are preparing to play their season-opener against the Chargers next Friday night in Sao Paulo, Brazil.",
      "One of Kelce's best friends, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, also was on hand for the game, perhaps to take in the sight of another No. 15 wearing red and white. Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola has been compared to the three-time Super Bowl MVP ever since taking over in Lincoln, not only because they look similar but because they also were the same jersey.",

      "The firing of the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the resignation of several high-profile agency leaders pose immediate challenges to the operations of the nation's premiere public health agency, experts said.",
      "It could take \u201cseveral months\u201d to identify and confirm a replacement for CDC Director Susan Monarez, who was terminated Wednesday after less than a month on the job, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, director of the American Public Health Association. And it could take more time to fill at least four key vacated positions that oversee disease outbreaks, vaccines and public health data.",
      "\u201cThe whole chain of command has just been disrupted,\u201d Benjamin told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's like getting rid of your generals in the middle of a war.\u201d",
      "Health experts said Americans could see immediate effects, from confusion over the availability of COVID-19 vaccines to delayed responses to outbreaks of infectious diseases such as measles or foodborne illnesses caused by germs such as E. coli or listeria.",
      "\u201cThe average American should worry about their safety and their health and whether information coming out of Health and Human Services is reliable or trustworthy,\u201d said Dr. Anne Schuchat, former principal deputy director of the CDC, who left the agency in 2021.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the sudden changes at the CDC.",
      "The White House ousted Monarez on Wednesday after apparent clashes between the CDC director and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over changes to the nation's vaccine policy.",
      "Officials at the White House said Monarez was dismissed because she was not aligned with President Donald Trump's agenda and refused to resign.",
      "That action coincided with the resignation this week of at least four top CDC agency leaders: Dr. Debra Houry, the agency\u2019s deputy director; Dr. Daniel Jernigan, leader of the agency\u2019s work on emerging infectious diseases; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a top vaccine official; and Dr. Jennifer Layden, who led public health data efforts.",
      "Monarez was the first CDC director to require Senate confirmation under a law that took effect in 2023. Replacing her would require Trump to nominate a new director, who would then need to be considered and confirmed by the Senate. On Thursday, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy said the high-profile departures will \u201crequire oversight\u201d of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which he chairs.",
      "In the meantime, the president could name an acting CDC director, Benjamin noted.",
      "Replacing the leaders in the other positions, including those who held the jobs for years, will be difficult, Schuchat said.",
      "\u201cThe four people who resigned led important parts of the agency and had the respect of the nation and the world,\u201d she said.",

      "The clash at CDC was apparently triggered by conflict over changes in policy regarding recommendations for COVID-19 vaccinations that could make getting a shot more complicated for people.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID-19 shots on Wednesday but limited their use for many Americans \u2014 and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children. The new jabs from three manufacturers are approved for all seniors, but the FDA narrowed their use for adults and children to those with high-risk health conditions, such as asthma or obesity.",
      "The FDA approval is typically reviewed by a CDC vaccine advisory committee, which makes recommendations for use. Monarez said she would not automatically sign off on recommendations of the committee, which was handpicked by Kennedy, according to Dr. Richard Besser, a former CDC acting director. (Besser is now president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which helps support The Associated Press Health and Science Department.)",
      "The changes present new barriers to access for millions of Americans, who would have to prove their risk, and others who may want the shots but suddenly no longer qualify. The vaccines were previously recommended for Americans 6 months and older.",

      "In addition, the disruption at the CDC could jeopardize many local health services undergirded by the agency's support and expertise, Schuchat noted. That could mean tracking a simmering infectious disease outbreak, such as measles, or outbreaks of foodborne illness.",

      "Yang Huafeng, a 92-year-old Chinese army veteran, recalls the modest military presence at the founding of communist China in 1949",
      "SHENYANG, China -- Yang Huafeng, a 92-year-old Chinese army veteran, remembers the troops on horseback and the handful of planes that marked the founding of communist China in 1949.",
      "It was a far cry from the military might the country will display Wednesday in a parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. A Japanese invasion before and during the conflict devastated China and left millions of people dead.",
      "\u201cNow you see our country\u2019s planes ... no one dares to mess with them,\u201d the veteran told journalists at a war museum in the city of Shenyang. His chest covered with ribbons and medals, Yang expressed pride in his country's rise.",
      "The ruling Communist Party is trying to amplify that feeling by playing up the war anniversary with spruced-up museums, new war movies and the military parade, attended by leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.",
      "To the outside world, the missiles, tanks and fighter jets at the parade will be a show of strength as China seeks to portray itself as an alternative to the American-dominated postwar era.",
      "Domestically, the commemoration is an effort to show how far the country has come \u2014 and in so doing, build support for the party and its leader, President Xi Jinping. China was a major front in World War II, a fact often overlooked in accounts that focus more on the fight for Europe and U.S. naval battles in the Pacific.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really important part of the Communist Party\u2019s legitimizing narrative as the leader of the Chinese people,\u201d said Emily Matson, a scholar of modern Chinese history who teaches at Georgetown and George Washington universities.",
      "The party didn\u2019t always make such a big deal about the end of the war. The Communists only came to power four years later, and the bulk of the fighting was done by their rivals, the Nationalist government they overthrew in 1949.",
      "The wartime struggle was less pertinent in the first decades of communist rule, when the focus was on building a socialist state.",
      "That began to change in 1978, when the party launched the reforms that propelled China\u2019s economic rise. Its message gradually shifted from the triumph of the working class to nation-building.",
      "\u201cThis is a new nationalism in that it begins to include not just the Chinese proletariat but the whole Chinese nation,\u201d Matson said.",
      "Over time, the defeat of Japan became part of the nation-building story, a starting point marking the end of a long period when foreign powers imposed their will on a weaker China.",
      "Xi, who came to power in 2012, has stepped up a drive to build a strong country that can no longer be bullied. His government pushed back against new U.S. tariffs this year, forcing President Donald Trump to scale them down.",
      "In 2014, the government designated Sept. 3 \u2014 the day after Japan formally surrendered \u2014 as Victory Day. The following year, the 70th anniversary of the war's end, it staged a military parade on the day for the first time.",
      "Party historians define Japan's defeat as a turning point. It laid an important foundation for the rebuilding of the nation, said Wang Junwei, the chair of the Academic and Editorial Council at the Institute of Party History and Literature.",
      "\u201cThe victory in the anti-Japanese war transformed the Chinese nation from deep crisis toward great rejuvenation,\u201d he said.",

      "The visit comes as the Trump administration has dramatically stepped up operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean, including recent military deployments and what it said was a lethal strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel.",
      "In talks with leaders in Mexico and Ecuador on Wednesday and Thursday, Rubio will make the case that broader, deeper cooperation with the U.S. on those issues is vitally important to improving health, safety and security in the Americas and the Caribbean.",
      "Yet, President Donald Trump has alienated many in the region \u2014 far beyond the usual array of U.S. antagonists like Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela \u2014 with persistent demands, coupled with threats of sweeping tariffs and massive sanctions for not complying with his desires.",
      "Shortly before Rubio left for Mexico, he and Trump announced the U.S. military had carried out a strike in the southern Caribbean against a vessel hauling drugs that departed from Venezuela.",
      "Trump announced that the vessel was being operated by the Tren de Aragua gang, which his administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization, and that 11 people were killed in the strike, which he said took place in international waters.",
      "\u201cPlease let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!\u201d Trump said.",
      "Rubio, speaking to reporters before boarding his plane to Mexico, said Trump \u201cis going to be on offense against drug cartels and drug trafficking in the United States. It destabilizes not just the country but the entire Caribbean basin.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear that he\u2019s going to use the full power of America and the full might of the United States to take on and eradicate these drug cartels, no matter where they\u2019re operating from and no matter how long they\u2019ve been able to act with impunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThose days are over.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has demanded, and so far won, some concessions from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's government, which is eager to defuse his tariff threats.",
      "Rubio arrived in Mexico City just a few hours after Sheinbaum had planned to lead a meeting of the country\u2019s most important security forum, which brings together all 32 governors, the army, navy, federal prosecutor\u2019s office and security commanders to coordinate actions across Mexico.",
      "Sheinbaum had been talking for weeks about how Mexico was finalizing a comprehensive security agreement with the State Department that, among other things, was supposed to include plans for a \u201cjoint investigation group\u201d to combat the flow of fentanyl and the drug's precursors into the U.S. and weapons from north to south.",
      "\u201cUnder no circumstance will we accept interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that is detrimental to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the country,\u201d she said Monday in her State of the Nation address marking her first year in office.",

      "Sheinbaum lowered her expectations Tuesday, saying it would not be a formal agreement but rather a kind of memorandum of understanding to share information and intelligence on drug trafficking or money laundering obtained \u201cby them in their territory, by us in our territory unless commonly agreed upon.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere will be moments of greater tension, of less tension, of issues that we do not agree on, but we have to try to have a good relationship, and I believe tomorrow\u2019s meeting will show that,\" Sheinbaum said of her meeting Wednesday with Rubio. \"It is a relationship of respect and at the same time collaboration.\u201d",
      "To appease Trump, Sheinbaum has gone after Mexican cartels and their fentanyl production more aggressively than her predecessor. The government has sent the National Guard to the northern border and delivered 55 cartel figures long wanted by U.S. authorities to the Trump administration.",

The Senate\u2019s powerful blue ribbon committee resumed on Monday a separate inquiry, where senators grilled a private contractor who has denied any wrongdoing but faced intense questioning over her family\u2019s fleet of at least 28 luxury cars and SUVs.",
      "Rep. Elajiah San Fernando said that given the huge budget allocated for flood control infrastructure and water resource development in the Philippines, including more than 308 billion pesos ($5.4 billion) this year, the scale of the corruption could be \u201cof the grandest kind.\u201d",
      "Addressing construction companies, private contractors and politicians involved in anomalies or \u201cghost projects,\u201d San Fernando warned that Congress has \u201cno other objective but to see your heads rolling, to hold you into account and lock you up in jail.\u201d",
      "In July, back-to-back typhoons and seasonal monsoon downpours set off massive floods that affected millions of people, displaced more than 300,000 others, damaged nearly 3,000 houses and left extensive infrastructure and agricultural losses.

      "BRUSSELS -- Belgium will move toward recognizing a Palestinian state, the country's foreign minister said Tuesday, joining a growing list of countries preparing to take the step as Israel steps up its offensive in Gaza.",
      "Maxime Pr\u00e9vot said Belgium's plans to recognize a Palestinian state will be announced at the United Nations General Assembly later this month.",
      "However, the acknowledgment is predicated on two conditions \u2014 the return of all Israeli hostages held in Gaza and the removal of Hamas from political power in the coastal exclave. The conditions make it unlikely the recognition will be formalized anytime soon.",
      "The announcement marks the latest sign of international support for a Palestinian state, and would add Belgium to a list of more than 140 countries to recognize Palestinian statehood, including more than a dozen in Europe.",
      "Pr\u00e9vot on Tuesday also announced plans to ban goods coming from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and designate Hamas leaders, violent settlers, and two far-right Israeli ministers as persona non grata.",
      "\u201cThis is not about sanctioning the Israeli people but about ensuring that their government respects international and humanitarian law and taking action to try to change the situation on the ground,\u201d Pr\u00e9vot said on social platform X.",
      "Pr\u00e9vot said the European Union should put more pressure on Israel by suspending ties with the country, including its trade pact known as the Association Agreement.",
      "Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has stressed ties within the bloc\u2019s 27 nations, ignited protests across the continent, and frayed political coalitions including in Belgium and its neighbor the Netherlands. But despite growing political tension, Israel\u2019s deep ties with European military, business and academic institutions remain largely intact.",
      "Belgium's announcement sparked fury from Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who, along with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, is a likely target of the new sanctions.",

      "Bayrou himself triggered the confidence vote by announcing that he would seek parliamentary approval for his unpopular budget plans. Arguing that sharp cuts are needed to repair public finances, he unveiled plans last month to cut 44 billion euros ($51 billion) in spending in 2026, after France\u2019s deficit hit 5.8% of gross domestic product last year, way above the official EU target of 3%.",
      "France is also faced with a massive debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France\u2019s public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros, or 114% of GDP. Debt servicing remains a major budget item, accounting for around 7% of state spending.",
      "Bayrou's plan, which includes removing two public holidays, has been slammed by his political rivals, who now have a golden opportunity to bring him down.",
      "Bayrou, however, has not given up hope of surviving the vote and has organized a series of meetings with political leaders. Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, a left-wing member of the European Parliament, said after talks with Bayrou on Tuesday that the prime minister should cancel the confidence vote if he truly wants to negotiate and seek a compromise on the budget, which Glucksmann called \u201cunacceptable\u201d in its current form.",

Leading in opinion polls, National Rally leaders have repeatedly insisted they are ready to govern if Bayrou falls.",

      "At President Donald Trump's news conference, Fox News' Peter Doocy asked something that surely baffled those who avoided social media over Labor Day: \u201cHow did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?\u201d",
      "Early in Donald Trump's news conference Tuesday, Fox News' Peter Doocy asked a question that surely baffled people who avoided social media for Labor Day.",
      "\u201cHow did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?\u201d Doocy said to the president.",
      "Doocy was referring to speculation about Trump's health that spread online during the long Labor Day weekend, fueled in part by the president's relative absence from the public for several days. The incident has renewed \u2014 for a different president \u2014 questions about how journalists should handle the sensitive issue of how healthy an aging leader of the free world actually is.",
      "Trump said he was more active than had been apparent publicly and criticized the media. \u201cIt's fake news \u2014 it's so fake,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's why the media has so little credibility.\u201d",
      "A year ago, President Joe Biden, now 82, abandoned his reelection effort after a halting, confused performance in a debate with Trump provoked concerns about his ability to serve another four-year term. Journalists who covered the White House faced attacks for not doing enough to investigate Biden's health and condition.",
      "Trump, who turned 79 in June, is the oldest person to be inaugurated as president. Pictures showing him with bruises on his hands and apparent swelling in his legs circulated online recently, as did clips of misstatements in public, such as mistakenly referring to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last month as \u201cKristi.\u201d",
      "None of these is evidence of serious illness.",
      "The White House has said Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which means veins in the legs can\u2019t properly carry blood back to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower legs. It\u2019s a fairly common condition for older adults.",
      "As far as the bruising, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it\u2019s from \u201cfrequent handshaking and the use of aspirin,\u201d which Trump takes regularly to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Easy bruising in general could have several relatively benign causes, including old age or side effects from medications like blood thinners.",
      "Besides creating spikes in online activity through sites like X, Facebook and TikTok, stories speculating about Trump's health appeared in outlets like The Hill, the New York Post, People, Rolling Stone, Raw Story and Breitbart in recent days, according to NewsWhip.",
      "But outlets like The New York Times, The Associated Press, MSNBC and Fox News Channel did not write about it or discuss it, at least prior to the issue being brought up at Trump's news conference.",
      "On CNN Tuesday morning, anchor Audie Cornish had a short discussion about the topic. \u201cAt one point the term \u2018Trump is dead\u2019 was trending on social media,\" Cornish said. \u201cNot true.\u201d She noted one of Trump's social media posts from Labor Day, when he wrote, \u201cNEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE.\u201d",

      "Beyond punditry, however, news outlets face serious questions about how to handle the story, much like they did with Biden. The physical signs that have been pointed out online should trigger serious probes into the president's health. Some critics, like historian Garrett Graff, said it was puzzling that many in the media hadn't treated it like a news story \u2014 although the timing over a holiday weekend surely made it more challenging.",

That could include observations like the president's bruising or falling asleep at meetings, and analyses of what drugs the president is taking and why.",
      "\u201cSimilarly, radio silence from a prominent office holder, especially one who appears on media frequently, is a valuable thing for journalists to report,\u201d Grueskin said. \u201cI don't think that news organizations need to publish those \u2018everyone is talking about XYZ on social media, so we need to repeat it\u2019 stories.\u201d",

      "Given all that, Graff wrote in a Substack post that \u201cyou'd think reporters would be falling all over themselves to dig deeper right now. Clearly, there's enough smoke to warrant at least a major story in a major outlet investigating whether there is fire.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration was handed a win by a federal appeals court on Tuesday in its effort to freeze billions of dollars and terminate contracts for nonprofits to run a \u201cgreen bank\u201d aimed at financing climate-friendly projects.",
      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency had blasted the Biden-era program as a waste of taxpayer money, tried to claw back funding that had already been distributed and accused the nonprofits of mismanagement \u2014 misuse accusations that Justice Department lawyers did not back up in court.",
      "The decision by the 2-1 majority on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit finds that federal officials have broad latitude to cancel funds that have been appropriated by Congress without facing allegations in federal district court that they broke the law. A strongly worded dissent said the outcome was a loss not just for the five green bank groups who sued the EPA, but for the authority of Congress to write policy and maintain its traditional power of the purse.",
      "In an opinion written by Judge Neomi Rao, the appeals court said the dispute should be heard in a federal claims court that considers contract disputes. Rao was appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term.",
      "\u201cIn sum, district courts have no jurisdiction to hear claims that the federal government terminated a grant agreement arbitrarily or with impunity. Claims of arbitrary grant termination are essentially contractual,\u201d Rao wrote in a decision supported by Judge Gregory Katsas, also a Trump appointee.",
      "The green bank groups said the federal claims court is limited to awarding possible monetary damages. The groups were seeking an order allowing them immediate access to their funds, which total about $16 billion.",
      "EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch said in a statement that the decision reaffirmed EPA's \"duty to be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see reason prevail in the court system,\" she said.",
      "A lower court had previously said the EPA couldn\u2019t support Administrator Lee Zeldin\u2019s accusations of wrongdoing and that the nonprofits should not have their contracts terminated and must have access to certain funding that had been frozen. The majority ruling overturned that decision Tuesday, although the order won\u2019t go into effect immediately to allow for an opportunity to appeal.",
      "The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a \u201cgreen bank,\u201d was authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the climate law approved by congressional Democrats. However, its goals run counter to the Trump administration\u2019s opposition to climate-friendly policies and its embrace of fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the billions in grants as a \u201cgold bar\u201d scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.",
      "In terminating the grants, Zeldin cited a conservative journalist\u2019s undercover video made late last year that showed a former EPA employee saying the agency was throwing \u201cgold bars off the Titanic\u201d \u2014 presumably a reference to spending before the end of Biden's term.",
      "In a February interview with Fox News, Zeldin said he suspected the green bank \u201cwas a clear-cut case of waste and abuse\u201d and an example of what he called \u201cself-dealing\u201d among the Biden administration and like-minded groups.",

      "Kraft Heinz is splitting into two companies a decade after they joined in a massive merger that created one of the biggest food companies on the planet",
      "NEW YORK -- Kraft Heinz is splitting into two a decade after a merger of the brands created one of the biggest food companies on the planet.",
      "One of the companies, currently called Global Taste Elevation Co., will include shelf stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, Kraft Heinz said Tuesday. The other, currently called North American Grocery Co., will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The official names of the two companies will be released later.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split.",
      "The company in 2015 wanted to capitalize on its massive scale, but shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table. Kraft Heinz and other food producers have shifted offerings to follow that trend.",
      "\u201cKraft Heinz\u2019s brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\u201d Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.",
      "The path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.",
      "3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It\u2019s known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.",
      "The deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz\u2019s new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.",
      "At the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought for a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.",
      "In 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.",
      "But the combined company struggled, despite layoffs of thousands of employees and other cost-cutting measures. Even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid.",

      "In 2019, Kraft Heinz slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion, citing operational costs and supply chain problems. But many investors blamed the company\u2019s leadership, saying its zeal for cost-cutting was hurting brand innovation.",
      "In 2021, Kraft Heinz sold both its Planters nut business and its natural cheese business, vowing to reinvest the money into higher-growth brands like P3 protein snacks and Lunchables.",
      "But the company\u2019s net revenue has fallen every year since 2020, when it saw a pandemic-related bump in sales. In April, Kraft Heinz lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker customer spending in the U.S. and the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Carlos Abrams-Rivera will continue to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and will become CEO of North American Grocery Co. once the separation is complete. Kraft Heinz said that its board is working with an executive search firm to identify potential CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.",
      "Kraft Heinz has no plans to change its current headquarter locations in Chicago and Pittsburgh. It currently expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2026.",

    "story": [
      "Families that lost loved ones in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners may be getting their last chance to demand the American aerospace company\u2019s criminal prosecution",
      "Families who lost loved ones in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners may get their last chance to demand the company face criminal prosecution Wednesday. That's when a federal judge in Texas is set to hear arguments on a U.S. government motion to dismiss a felony charge against Boeing.",
      "U.S. prosecutors charged Boeing with conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with the crashes that killed 346 people off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia. Federal prosecutors alleged Boeing deceived government regulators about a flight-control system that was later implicated in the fatal flights, which took place less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.",
      "Boeing decided to plead guilty instead of going to trial, but U.S. District Chief Judge Reed O\u2019Connor rejected the aircraft maker's plea agreement in December. O'Connor, who also will consider whether to let prosecutors dismiss the conspiracy charge, objected to diversity, equity and inclusion policies potentially influencing the selection of an independent monitor to oversee the company's promised reforms.",
      "Lawyers representing relatives of some of the passengers who died cheered O'Connor's decision, hoping it would further their goal of seeing former Boeing executives prosecuted during a public trial and more severe financial punishment for the company. Instead, the delay worked to Boeing's favor.",
      "The judge\u2019s refusal to accept the agreement meant the company was free to challenge the Justice Department\u2019s rationale for charging Boeing as a corporation. It also meant prosecutors would have to secure a new deal for a guilty plea.",
      "The government and Boeing spent six months renegotiating their plea deal. During that time, President Donald Trump returned to office and ordered an end to the diversity initiatives that gave O\u2019Connor pause.",
      "By the time the Justice Department\u2019s criminal fraud section briefed the judge in late May, the charge and the plea were off the table. A non-prosecution agreement the two sides struck said the government would dismiss the charge in exchange for Boeing paying or investing another $1.1 billion in fines, compensation for the crash victims' families, and internal safety and quality measures.",
      "The Justice Department said it offered Boeing those terms in light of \u201csignificant changes\u201d Boeing made to its quality control and anti-fraud programs since entering into the July 2024 plea deal.",
      "The department also said it thought that persuading a jury to punish the company with a criminal conviction would be risky, while the revised agreement ensures \"meaningful accountability, delivers substantial and immediate public benefits, and brings finality to a difficult and complex case whose outcome would otherwise be uncertain.\u201d",
      "Judge O'Connor has invited some of the families to address the court on Wednesday. One of the people who plans to speak is Catherine Berthet, whose daughter, Camille Geoffrey, died at age 28 when a 737 Max crashed shortly after takeoff from Ethiopia's Addis Ababa Bole International Airport.",
      "Berthet, who lives in France, is part of a group of about 30 families who want the judge to deny the government's request and to appoint a special prosecutor to take over the case.",
      "\u201cWhile it is no surprise that Boeing is trying to buy everyone off, the fact that the DOJ, which had a guilty plea in its hands last year, has now decided not to prosecute Boeing regardless of the judge\u2019s decision is a denial of justice, a total disregard for the victims and, above all, a disregard for the judge,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Justice Department lawyers maintain the families of 110 crash victims either support a pre-trial resolution or do not oppose the non-prosecution agreement. The department's lawyers also dispute whether O'Connor has authority to deny the motion without finding prosecutors acted in bad faith instead of the public interest.",

      "Boeing reached a settlement in 2021 that protected it from criminal prosecution, but the Justice Department determined last year that the company had violated the agreement and revived the charge.",
      "The case revolves around a new software system Boeing developed for the Max. In the 2018 and 2019 crashes, the software pitched the nose of the plane down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor, and pilots flying then-new planes for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines were unable to regain control.",
      "The Transportation Department's inspector general found that Boeing did not inform key Federal Aviation Administration personnel about changes it made to the MCAS software before regulators set pilot training requirements for the Max and certified the airliner for flight.",
      "Acting on the incomplete information, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737 pilots, avoiding the need for flight simulators that would have made it more expensive for airlines to adopt the latest version of the jetliner.",
      "Airlines began flying the Max in 2017. After the Ethiopia crash, the planes were grounded worldwide for 20 months while the company redesigned the software.",
      "In the final weeks of Trump's first term, the Justice Department charged Boeing with conspiring to defraud the U.S. government but agreed to defer prosecution and drop the charge after three years if the company paid a $2.5 settlement and strengthened its ethics and legal compliance programs.",
      "The 2021 settlement agreement was on the verge of expiring when a panel covering an unused emergency exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight over Oregon at the beginning of last year. No one was seriously injured, but the potential disaster put Boeing's safety record under renewed scrutiny.",
      "A former Boeing test pilot remains the only individual charged with a crime in connection with the crashes. In March 2022, a federal jury acquitted him of misleading the FAA about the amount of training pilots would need to fly the Max.",

      "Nonprofits are increasingly using storytelling to connect with donors",
      "MIAMI -- Cindy Eggleton has always believed in the power of a story.",
      "But the CEO and co-founder of Brilliant Cities, a Detroit-based early childhood development nonprofit that supports learning in underserved communities, never expected someone to tell hers. And definitely not in a sleek documentary with a slick soundtrack and plenty of images of other Detroit institutions, such as General Motors, Diana Ross, and the historic Fox Theatre.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never been about me,\u201d said Eggleton, adding that participating in the \u201cNevertheless: The Women Changing the World\u201d documentary series on YouTube was her way of honoring her late mother, Geraldine, who inspired her to speak out and help others in their community.",
      "However, as they face an increasingly uncertain funding landscape, nonprofits are focusing more on storytelling in outreach to donors \u2013 both big and small \u2013 and raising production values for videos and podcasts.",
      "\u201cStorytelling is how we\u2019re able to draw people in and get them to connect to a deeper truth about themselves or about the world or a problem that needs to be solved,\u201d said Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Jayaram Garcia. \u201cIt\u2019s connecting those issues back to you as a human and not saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s their problem. That\u2019s all the way over there.\u2019 The story allows it to be human.\u201d",
      "The foundation launched the production house Elevate Studios earlier this year to tell more of those stories, Jayaram Garcia said. \u201cNevertheless: The Women Changing the World,\u201d Elevate Studios\u2019 first series, has already generated more than 3 million views on YouTube and will debut its second season in the summer of 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible to see the growth we\u2019ve had on YouTube and how it\u2019s resonated so quickly with so many people,\u201d Jayaram Garcia said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re on to something here.\u201d",
      "Philanthropic support of storytelling has been ongoing for decades, mostly through donors funding documentary projects. Open Society Foundations created the Soros Documentary Fund in 1996 before the Sundance Institute took it over in 2002, with the George Soros-backed nonprofit\u2019s continued monetary support. The Ford Foundation formalized its funding plans in 2011, creating its JustFilms program that still supports 25-30 documentary films annually. Earlier this month, Firelight Media, a New York-based nonprofit supporting documentary filmmakers of color, launched the Firelight Fund, which will offer directors $50,000 grants for their projects.",
      "But Lance Gould, founder and CEO of media strategy firm Brooklyn Story Lab, says what Elevate Prize Foundation and others are doing is different. He says it reflects both technological improvements that have lowered the cost of documentary storytelling and the rise of social media, which allows nonprofits to interact with donors directly.",
      "\u201cBeing able to tell your story well is paramount,\u201d said Gould, whose firm works with nonprofits to help them produce their own story-driven content. \u201cBut storytelling is not only about reaching viewers, it\u2019s also about having the right message for the right viewers.\u201d",
      "He suggests that nonprofits connect their work to larger initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 an ambitious list of 17 efforts from eliminating extreme poverty and hunger to guaranteeing every child a quality secondary education by 2030 \u2014 to attract more attention and support.",
      "Gould, who was previously executive editor of The Huffington Post and editor in chief of The Boston Phoenix, said \u201ceveryone can be their own media company at this point.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a point Nicole Bronzan, vice president of communications and content for the Council on Foundations, hopes is not lost in the push for more storytelling.",

      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to feel that they have to make big technological investments in order to tell better stories,\u201d Bronzan said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want anyone to feel like they have to have a big fancy studio, but certainly the news that folks are investing in storytelling is great for us and for the whole sector.\u201d",
      "In a Council on Foundations report released last year, \u201c A New Voice for Philanthropy: How Deeper Stories and Clearer Language Can Build Trust,\u201d researchers, including Bronzan, reported that people had positive attitudes toward foundations, but most didn\u2019t really understand how foundations worked. Bronzan said stories that provide more transparency about how donations are used and how those decisions are made help connect people to a nonprofit and its work.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re telling those stories,\u201d she said, \u201cI can only imagine that people will be more inclined to open up their pocketbooks and say, \u2018Oh, OK, these are causes that need my support.\u2019\u201d",
      "So far, that has been the case for Brilliant Cities, which saw an increase in donations after Eggleton\u2019s episode debuted on YouTube.",
      "\u201cWe have a funder who wants to increase his gift from $7,000 to $100,000,\u201d said Eggleton, whose nonprofit turns a neighborhood\u2019s vacant homes into community centers with family services ranging from tutoring to mental health support groups. She said new donors have also reached out. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of incredible.\u201d",
      "Though Brilliant Cities doesn\u2019t rely on federal funding for its services, Eggleton said government aid cuts have made a tough funding environment even tougher because the competition for non-governmental donations becomes even tougher.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s being told what\u2019s being taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are pulling at grant officers and individuals with stock market gains. I think it\u2019s more than the funding, though. I think it\u2019s about really recognizing how the world already feels so disconnected and now feels even more so.\u201d",
      "Storytelling, Eggleton said, helps reduce that. By focusing on female changemakers, Elevate Studios makes an even stronger point, she said, adding she\u2019s been quoting Spanish poet Antonio Machado \u2014 \u201cThere is no path/We make the path by walking\u201d \u2014 as she explains the power of the series.",
      "\u201cThis is the time that we really do need to figure out how we build empathy through stories and not necessarily saying, \u2018You\u2019re wrong or you\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just show the world what can be and what should be.\u201d",

      "McDonald\u2019s is cutting prices on some combo meals to woo back customers who\u2019ve been turned off by the rising costs of grabbing a fast food meal.",
      "The price drop may induce its rivals, who have run into some of the same pricing issues, to follow.",
      "Starting Sept. 8, McDonald\u2019s will offer Extra Value Meals, which combine select entr\u00e9es like a Big Mac, an Egg McMuffin or a McCrispy sandwich with medium fries or hash browns and a drink. Prices will vary by location, but McDonald\u2019s said Extra Value Meals will cost 15% less than ordering each of those items separately.",
      "To kick off the promotion, McDonald\u2019s will offer an $8 Big Mac meal or a $5 Sausage McMuffin meal for a limited time in most of the country. Customers in California, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam will have to pay $1 more for those meals.",
      "McDonald\u2019s for years has seen a steady decline in visits from customers in the U.S. who have household incomes of less than $45,000 per year. CEO Chris Kempczinski said those consumers, and others, no longer see McDonald\u2019s as a good value.",
      "At a McDonald\u2019s near the company\u2019s Chicago headquarters, for example, a 10-piece Chicken McNugget meal costs $10.39.",
      "Higher prices have been been a drag on sales. McDonald\u2019s same-store sales \u2013 or sales at stores open at least a year \u2013 grew 2.5% in the April-June period, but that was mostly because of higher prices. Fast food visits by lower-income consumers dropped by double-digit percentages industrywide in the second quarter, McDonald\u2019s said.",
      "\u201cToday, too often, if you\u2019re that consumer, you\u2019re driving up to the restaurant and you\u2019re seeing combo meals priced over $10,\u201d Kempczinski said during a conference call with investors in August. \u201cThat absolutely is shaping value perceptions in a negative way. So we\u2019ve got to get that fixed.\u201d",

      "The company also blames higher costs. The average price of its menu items rose 40% between 2019 and 2024, McDonald\u2019s said, to account for a 40% increase in the cost of labor, packaging and food.",
      "But within a month, McDonald\u2019s introduced a $5 Meal Deal, which combined a McDouble burger or a McChicken sandwich with small fries and a small drink. That deal proved so popular it was extended through this summer.",

      "Overall U.S. fast food customer traffic fell nearly 1% in the second quarter, according to Revenue Management Solutions, a consulting company. The company said price increases were sharply lower than previous quarters, suggesting that chains are already offering more deals.",

      "A decline in foreign visitors traveling to the United States has stretched well into the summer",
      "LAS VEGAS -- For a few hopeful weeks this summer, a bright billboard on the major highway linking Toronto to New York greeted Canadian drivers with a simple message: \"Buffalo Loves Canada.\u201d",
      "The marketing campaign, which included a $500 gift card giveaway, was meant to show Buffalo's northern neighbors they were welcome, wanted and missed.",
      "At first, it seemed like it might work, said Patrick Kaler, CEO of the local tourism organization Visit Buffalo Niagara. More than 1,000 people entered the giveaway. But by the end of July, it was clear the city's reliable summer wave of Canadian visitors would not arrive this year.",
      "Buffalo\u2019s struggle reflects a broader downturn in international tourism to the U.S. that travel analysts warn could persist well into the future. From northern border towns to major hot spots like Las Vegas and Los Angeles, popular travel destinations reported hosting fewer foreign visitors this summer.",
      "Experts and some local officials attribute the trend that first emerged in February to President Donald Trump's return to the White House. They say his tariffs, immigration crackdown and repeated jabs about the U.S. acquiring Canada and Greenland alienated travelers from other parts of the world.",
      "\"To see the traffic drop off so significantly, especially because of rhetoric that can be changed, is so disheartening,\u201d Kaler said.",
      "The World Travel & Tourism Council projected ahead of Memorial Day that the U.S. would be the only country among the 184 it studied where foreign visitor spending would fall in 2025. The finding was \u201ca clear indicator that the global appeal of the U.S. is slipping,\u201d the global industry association said.",
      "\u201cThe world\u2019s biggest travel and tourism economy is heading in the wrong direction,\u201d Julia Simpson, the council\u2019s president and CEO, said. \"While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the \u2018closed\u2019 sign.\u201d",
      "Travel research firm Tourism Economics, meanwhile, predicted this month that the U.S. would see 8.2% fewer international arrivals in 2025, an improvement from its earlier forecast of a 9.4% decline but well below the numbers of foreign visitors to the country before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThe sentiment drag has proven to be severe,\u201d the firm said, noting that airline bookings indicate \u201cthe sharp inbound travel slowdown\u201d of May, June and July would likely persist in the months ahead.",
      "Deborah Friedland, managing director at the financial services firm Eisner Advisory Group, said he U.S. travel industry faced multiple headwinds \u2014 rising travel costs, political uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical tensions.",
      "Since returning to office, Trump has doubled down on some of the hard-line policies that defined his first term, reviving a travel ban targeting mainly African and Middle Eastern countries, tightening rules around visa approvals and ramping up mass immigration raids. At the same time, the push for tariffs on foreign goods that quickly became a defining feature of his second term gave some citizens elsewhere a sense they were unwanted.",
      "\u201cPerception is reality,\u201d Friedland said.",
      "Organizers of an international swing dancing said an impression of America's hostility to foreigners led them to postpone the event, which had been scheduled to take place this month in the Harlem area of New York City.",
      "About three months into Trump\u2019s second term, international competitors began pulling out of the world finals of the International Lindy Hop Championships, saying they felt unwelcome, event co-producer Tena Morales said. About half of attendees each year come from outside the U.S., primarily from Canada and France, she said.",
      "Contest organizers are considering whether to host the annual competition in another country until Trump's presidency ends, Morales said.",

A similar pattern surfaced in Asia, where the U.S. data showed double-digit decreases in arrivals from Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines. Fewer residents of countries throughout Africa also had traveled to the U.S. as of July.",

      "As the summer winds down, though, the absence of foreign visitors in Buffalo was still visible, according to Kaler, the head of Visit Buffalo Niagara.",
      "Canada sent over 20.2 million visitors to the U.S. last year, more than any other country, U.S. government data showed. But this year, residents of Canada have been among the most reluctant to visit.",
      "In a major U-turn, more U.S. residents drove into Canada in June and July than Canadians making the reverse trip, according to Canada\u2019s national statistical agency. Statistics Canada said it was the first time that happened in nearly two decades with the exception of two months during the pandemic.",
      "In July alone, the number of Canadian residents returning from the U.S. by car was down 37% from the year before, and return trips by plane fell 26%, the agency said.",
      "As a result, Visit Buffalo Niagara shifted its marketing efforts this summer to cities like Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago. Amateur children\u2019s sporting events also helped fill the void left by Canadian tourists.",
      "\u201cWe will always welcome Canadians back when the time is right,\u201d Kaler said. \u201cI don\u2019t want Canadians to feel like we see them as just dollar signs or a transaction at our cash registers. They mean more to us that that.\"",

      "A month after Congress voted to strip public media of public money, PBS and NPR stations are working to cope \u2014 and survive",
      "NEW YORK -- Coping with a sudden loss in federal funding, PBS affiliate KSPS in Spokane, Washington, faced a surprise extra hurdle. Many of its contributing members \u2014 at one point almost half \u2014 lived in Canada, and they were withdrawing support out of anger at President Donald Trump's desire to make the country the 51st member of the United States.",
      "When Congress decided this summer to eliminate $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, it left some 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations, each with unique issues related to their communities and history, to figure out what that means.",
      "Many launched emergency fund drives and are heartened by the response. The national NPR and PBS networks are reducing expected dues payments, and a philanthropic effort focused on the hardest-hit stations is taking shape. No stations have shut down, but job and programming cuts are already beginning.",
      "In Spokane, KSPS has always tried to keep its requests for member donations separate from appeals for public funding. Not anymore. Congress left the station with a $1.2 million hole to fill, about 18% of its budget, and the station is using that as a pretext to seek help from listeners.",
      "\u201cWe have definitely seen some attrition from our Canadian members,\u201d said Skyler Reep, the station's interim general manager.",
      "Long suspicious of a liberal bent to public media news coverage, Republicans in Congress responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s wishes in July and eliminated funding for the systems. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes the funding, has taken steps to shut down.",
      "In some parts of the country, the answer to pleas for help have exceeded expectations. Public radio station WHQR in Wilmington, N.C. raised more than $200,000 in three days, filling a $174,000 hole and then some. It's a small community growing fast with an influx of retirees, many who depend on the station's news to learn about their new home, said general manager Kevin Crane.",
      "With $525,000 gone from its budget, Hawaii Public Radio has already raised $650,000 in an emergency fund drive. \u201cIt's a validation that what you're doing is essential to the community and is appreciated by the community,\u201d said Meredith Artley, president and CEO. The 2023 wildfires in Maui and their aftermath were covered steadily by Hawaii Public Radio news reporters.",
      "\u201cThe initial response in terms of support for both stations and the NPR network has been extraordinary,\u201d said Katherine Maher, NPR president. \u201cPeople did a lot of work leading up to the vote, in actions and calls. When that did not prove convincing, they turned to direct support.\u201d",
      "Stations across the country have stories that make them smile: the youngster from Florida who collected money for public stations in Alaska, sending a note written in crayon; the regular $300 donor who came in to PBS SoCal with a $100,000 check, one of three six-figure donations the station has received.",
      "Most stations aren't in areas with so many wealthy donors. Most station managers are like Jeff Hanks of PBS' LPTV in Lakeland, Minnesota. He lies awake wondering where he will find $1 million to pay for things like his station's nightly newscast, a primary news source for central and northern Minnesota.",
      "\u201cThese are extremely, extremely challenging times,\u201d Hanks said. \u201cWe're fighting hard every way we can.\u201d",
      "He knows membership donations won't make up for what is missing. Both PBS and NPR have taken steps to reduce the annual dues that stations pay for programming and other services. At PBS, it's an average 15% reduction, but needy stations get more \u2014 in one case, more than half of next year's dues will be forgiven, said PBS president Paula Kerger.",
      "NPR is encouraging donors in wealthier areas to adopt stations in poorer ones, perhaps in an area where a contributor has emotional ties.",
      "Public media leaders are also working with a group of philanthropists led by the Knight and MacArthur foundations that is hoping to raise some $50 million to support stations in areas hardest hit be the cuts. Ed Ulman, president and CEO of Alaska Public Media, which represents nearly two dozen radio and television stations in the largest state, said he'll be seeking money from this fund.",

      "Authorities said that if the export ban remains in force, it is expected to generate $300 million in the short term and $3 billion by 2027.",
      "Experts have argued that such efforts must come with more investment to grow domestic industries.",
      "\u201cThe ban seems to suggest that the government has identified a supply-gap issue, but an export ban does little actually to lock in current in-country production solely for Nigerian processors,\u201d Ikemesit Effiong, a partner at SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based risk advisory firm, told The Associated Press.",
      "The move appeared to contradict the long-standing trade policy of Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu, who has positioned the country as a free-market economy by removing a series of subsidies on essential commodities such as fuel and electricity. Tinubu has also floated the country's currency and reversed a ban on the import of dozens of items by the former government.",

    "story": [
      "The NFL has introduced several rule changes for the new season, including making last year's experimental kickoff permanent with some tweaks",
      "A new NFL season is set to begin with last year's experiment on the new kickoff becoming permanent with a new tweak and several other changes in rules and officiating.",
      "The league also will implement changes to the overtime rule for the regular season, expand replay assist, crack down on bad sportsmanship and use Hawk-Eye virtual measuring to replace the old-time chains to determine first downs.",
      "The league experimented with the so-called dynamic kickoff in 2024 in hopes of more returns while also making the play safer. Owners voted in April to make the change permanent while moving touchbacks on kicks that reach the end zone on the fly from the 30 to the 35, which is expected to lead to more kicks in play and more returns.",
      "There was no change in the tush push play that Philadelphia used so successfully on the way to winning the Super Bowl last season.",
      "Here\u2019s an explanation of some of the new rules that will be in place.",
      "The league was mostly pleased with the experimental kickoff put in place for 2024 that led to the rate of kickoff returns increasing from a record-low 21.8% in 2023 to 32.8% last season, while reducing the rate of injuries on what had been the game\u2019s most dangerous play.",
      "The rule made kickoffs more like scrimmage plays by placing the coverage players and blockers close together to eliminate the high-speed collisions that had contributed to so many injuries on the play. The league said the rate of concussions dropped 43% on returns, with a significant reduction as well in lower-body injuries.",
      "The problem last season was many teams still opted to kick the ball in the end zone because the touchback wasn\u2019t punitive enough. The average starting field position on a touchback was only 2.4 yards further than the average starting position after returns, which was the 27.6-yard line.",
      "By moving the touchback to the 35, the league projects that the return rate will rise to somewhere between 60% and 70%, with a similar increase in long returns, adding more excitement to the game.",
      "The league also approved a small tweak to how blockers on the return team are allowed to line up in the setup zone that could lead to longer returns.",
      "Teams returned just over 76% of kicks in the preseason, up from 70% in the 2024 preseason. But that number typically drops in the regular season when teams don't use kickoffs to evaluate players for spots at the end of the roster.",
      "Teams will still need to declare their intention to try an onside kick because of the different formation. But a new change will allow trailing teams to try one before the start of the fourth quarter after Kansas City had to kick deep while down 28 points in the final minute of the third quarter in the Super Bowl.",
      "Coverage players will also be allowed to line up one yard closer in hopes of increasing the rate of recovery from about 6% over the past three seasons to at least 10%.",
      "The league approved a proposal to make the regular season overtime more like the postseason, with both teams getting a chance at a possession, even if the team that gets the ball first scores a touchdown.",
      "The NFL added regular season overtime in 1974, adding a 15-minute sudden death period that ended on any score. In 2010, the rule was tweaked to a modified sudden death that required an opening possession touchdown to immediately end the game instead of only a field goal. That was in effect in both the regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Overtime then was shortened for the regular season to only 10 minutes in 2017. A rule change in 2022 for the playoffs only gave both teams the chance to score even with a touchdown on the opening possession.",

      "Now that will be the case in the regular season, after the improved field position on kickoffs made winning in OT on an opening possession TD easier.",
      "According to Sportradar, six of the 16 overtime games last season ended on an opening-drive TD for the most overtime games ended on the first drive since the rule change went into effect in 2010.",
      "In all, teams that won the overtime toss won 75% of the time last season, according to Sportradar, and have a .606 winning percentage in overtime since it was cut to 10 minutes.",
      "The league kept the 10-minute overtime period instead of expanding it back to 15 minutes like was originally proposed by Philadelphia, which could lead to teams opting to go for 2 and a win if they match an opening-drive TD with one of their own since there might not be time for another possession.",
      "The NFL expanded its replay assist system to overturn objective calls if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn\u2019t occur. The calls could include facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles and tripping. Replay also would be able to overturn a roughing-the-kicker or running-into-the-kicker penalty if video showed the defender made contact with the ball.",
      "The league has been using replay assist in recent years to overturn obvious errors on aspects like whether a pass is caught or where the ball should be spotted without the referee needing to stop the game for a review.",
      "The Competition Committee says there\u2019s no interest in allowing replay assists to call penalties on plays missed by officials on the field.",
      "Referees will no longer use the chains to determine first downs, opting instead for a virtual measuring system. This won\u2019t eliminate the officials who manually spot the ball and use chains to mark the line to gain.",
      "The Hawk-Eye system consists of six 8K cameras for optical tracking of the position of the ball with the result shown on stadium scoreboards. The league estimates that measurements will take about 30 seconds \u2014 about 40 seconds fewer than the average with the chains \u2014 although it took longer at times in the preseason.",
      "The league is also emphasizing sportsmanship and cracking down on violent and sexually suggestive gestures this season.",
      "In April, the NFL expanded prohibited acts to include banning the \u201cnose wipe\u201d gesture that league executive Troy Vincent said is affiliated with gangs.",
      "The unsportsmanlike conduct rule now states: \u201cany violent gesture, which shall include but not be limited to a throat slash, simulating firing or brandishing a gun, or using the \u2018nose wipe\u2019 gesture, or an act that is sexually suggestive or offensive.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Once Naomi Osaka is in the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament, look out.",
      "For a while, it was getting there that was the problem.",
      "Right now, Osaka appears to be back at her best, and she most definitively is back at that stage of a major, getting ready to face Karolina Muchova at the U.S. Open on Wednesday for a spot in the semifinals.",
      "It's the first time Osaka \u2014 who has been ranked No. 1 and now is seeded No. 23 \u2014 has made it this far at one of the four most important events in tennis since the Australian Open in early 2021. That was also the last time she won a Slam trophy.",
      "So far in her career, the 27-year-old Osaka has left with the championship every time she got past the fourth round at any major, something she did at Flushing Meadows on Monday with a dominant win against No. 3 seed Coco Gauff by a 6-3, 6-2 score in barely more than an hour.",
      "\u201cShe seems relaxed out there. ... She forced me to play how I did today,\" Gauff observed. \u201cRegardless (of) whatever form she\u2019s in, she\u2019s always a tough player, and I don\u2019t think anyone takes her for granted, regardless of where her \u2018form\u2019 is, especially on hard courts.\u201d",
      "Osaka is a four-time Grand Slam champion, always on that surface \u2014 winning in New York in 2018 and 2020, plus twice more at Melbourne Park \u2014 thanks to going a combined 12-0 in the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.",
      "Osaka was asked about that unbeaten mark.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it gives me pressure or confidence. I think for me, you know, this is kind of unchartered territory at this point of my career,\u201d Osaka said, referring to the 4 1/2-year gap. \u201cI\u2019m just enjoying it. I\u2019m having fun. I\u2019m being able to play against the best players in the world.\u201d",
      "It was later in 2021, at the French Open. that she revealed that she had been dealing with anxiety and depression, then began taking a series of mental health breaks. She later missed 17 months for maternity leave; her daughter, Shai, was born in July 2023.",
      "Two months after that, Osaka came to the U.S. Open and sat in the stands at Arthur Ashe Stadium to watch while Gauff beat Muchova in the semifinals en route to the title.",

She was the runner-up to Iga Swiatek on the French Open's red clay in 2023 and also has reached the semifinals on the hard courts at Flushing Meadows each of the last two years \u2014 eliminating Osaka in the second round in 2024.",
      "\u201cShe's a great player. I think she picked up her form again and she\u2019s getting better and better. We can see (from) her results,\u201d said Muchova, who got past Venus Williams in the first round last week. \u201cWe practiced here, actually. So I expect a really tough battle. It\u2019s going to be a challenge, for sure.\u201d",
      "As for what's changed about Osaka over the course of her latest comeback, Muchova thinks the main thing is getting in a rhythm by competing more.",
      "Osaka, equipped with a huge serve and huge forehand, has pushed top players over the last 1 1/2 years but hasn't always been able to quite get to the finish line, including when she held a match point but wasn't able to win a marvelous contest against Swiatek at Roland-Garros in 2024.",
      "\u201cThe difference, I think, is she just now (has) more matches under her belt, (and is) winning matches, and I\u2019d say ... she (has) that belief again that she can be the best, and trust her strokes more,\u201d Muchova said. \u201cPlaying really fast, really good.\u201d",

      "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- North Carolina\u2019s high-point moment in its first game under coach Bill Belichick came early.",
      "A festive pregame atmosphere led to a roar from the crowd at kickoff. And a season-opening drive moved at a crisp pace to the end zone.",
      "After that, well, Monday night\u2019s hyped-up debut turned into a romp by TCU \u2014 along with a reminder that even an NFL icon with six Super Bowl titles as a head coach can\u2019t just magically turn the Tar Heels into winners after decades of also-ran status.",
      "\u201cWe played competitively but then just couldn't sustain it,\u201d Belichick said in a familiar low tone from his NFL news conferences after the 48-14 loss. \u201cObviously, we have a lot of work to do. We need to do a better job all the way around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game.\u201d",
      "The blowout put a major damper on a night buzzing with optimism for the 73-year-old Belichick\u2019s college debut, only to see the Horned Frogs dominate so thoroughly they drove UNC fans to the Kenan Stadium exits by midway through the third quarter.",
      "\u201cIt was a great environment tonight,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cI mean, the fans were awesome. There was great energy in the stadium. We just didn\u2019t do enough to keep it going. We\u2019ve got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\u201d",
      "By the end of the game, Kenan was a ghost town and the Tar Heels had given up more points than in any previous opener in their history, according to Sportradar.",
      "It was a jarring result, even amid uncertainty as to exactly what to expect from UNC with roughly 70 new players between transfers and incoming recruits. There were few highlights after that opening drive beyond Kaleb Cost's athletic reeling in of a deflected ball for an interception, and quarterback Max Johnson returning in relief from a serious leg injury sustained in last year's opener at Minnesota.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just moving forward, just moving forward,\u201d said Cost, offering an unintentional callback to Belichick's famous \u201cWe're on to Cincinnati\u201d response to reporters' questions after a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014.",
      "UNC was picked to finish eighth in the 17-team Atlantic Coast Conference, though that seemed almost entirely predicated on Belichick\u2019s mere presence. This is a man, after all, who teamed with legendary quarterback Tom Brady to win six world titles in his 24-year run with the New England Patriots.

    "story": [
      "Two NASCAR teams, including one owned by Michael Jordan, have argued in federal court for a preliminary injunction to be recognized as chartered organizations",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Two NASCAR teams, one owned by NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan, on Tuesday argued to a federal judge why the organizations still should be issued a preliminary injunction to be recognized as chartered organizations until their antitrust suit against the stock car racing series is finished.",
      "The 11-page filing in U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina was in response to NASCAR notifying Judge Kenneth Bell it would not re-distribute any charters to new participants while the case heads toward its Dec. 1 court date. NASCAR's backtrack Friday came one day after an acrimonious hearing that included the disclosure of expletive-laden emails and text messages from Jordan and other high-profile litigants.",
      "23XI Racing, the team owned by Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports, owned by entrepreneur Bob Jenkins, are suing NASCAR over antitrust claims regarding the charter system. A charter is the equivalent of a franchise and guarantees chartered cars both a spot in the 40-car field each week, as well as a significantly larger chunk of payouts.",
      "NASCAR last September, after more than two years of contentious negotiations, presented teams with its final offer on charter extensions; 13 organization signed the agreements, but 23XI and Front Row refused.",
      "The two teams initially won a preliminary injunction to be recognized as chartered for this season until a jury verdict on the antitrust allegations. That was overturned, and 23XI and FRM are currently competing as \u201copen\u201d teams. NASCAR wants the money back the teams were paid during the portion of the season they were chartered.",
      "The teams also have appealed to have the chartered status reinstated, but NASCAR argued in court last week it has an interested buyer for one of the six charters previously held by 23XI and FRM, and it plans to immediately begin redistributing the charters. NASCAR backtracked after Thursday's hearing, and a ruling on the preliminary injunction is expected to come from Bell this week.",
      "NASCAR maintains that in holding off on redistributing charters, 23XI and FRM are no longer in danger of suffering irreparable harm. The teams countered Tuesday the threat still exists \u201cbecause of the risk of breach claims from their irreplaceable drivers and loss of sponsors in the absence of charter rights.\u201d",
      "Tyler Reddick of 23XI has a clause in his contract that says the team would be in breach if his Toyota is not chartered. Jeffrey Kessler, the attorney for the two teams, indicated in court that Reddick has notified 23XI it is in breach.",
      "Kessler also argued that NASCAR agreeing not to redistribute any charters now \u201cdoes not moot Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction or eliminate Plaintiffs' irreparable harm if no relief is provided.\u201d",

      "Dan Towriss, the majority owner of the Spire Motorsports' NASCAR team, as well as owner of Cadillac F1, Andretti Global and other motorsports properties, said he was \u201cvery disappointed with the direction\u201d the lawsuit has taken.",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",
      "The Mountain View, California, company has already vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s monopoly findings issued 13 months ago that led to Tuesday's ruling.",

      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged more than 7% in extended trading. That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google\u2019s search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",
      "Apple's shares rose 3% in extended trading after the ruling came out.",
      "Mehta refrained from ordering a sale of Chrome because he decided there wasn't adequate proof the browser served as an essential ingredient in Google's search monopoly, making a divestiture \u201ca poor fit for this case.\u201d",
      "Chrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.",
      "But the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",
      "While the wrangling over Mehta's ruling continues, Google is facing another potentially debilitating threat in another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department targeting the digital ad empire that was built up around its search engine. After different federal judge in Virginia declared that some of the technology underlying the ad network to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year, the Justice Department plans to make its case for another proposed breakup  in a trial scheduled to begin later this month.",

      "LONDON -- Bulgaria will not investigate suspected Russian electronic interference with a top European official's plane, officials said Monday \u2014 because this kind of GPS jamming is now so common.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was flying to Plovdiv, Bulgaria on Sunday when her plane was hit by GPS jamming. It landed safely but the disruption was the latest in a string of almost 80 incidents tracked by The Associated Press and blamed on Russia by Western officials since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "This year, Nordic and Baltic nations \u2014 including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2014 have repeatedly warned about greater electronic interference from Russia disrupting communications with planes, ships and drones.",
      "While Russian authorities suggest the jamming is defensive \u2014 to protect key cities and military infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks \u2014 Baltic officials say the depth of electronic interference has increased, causing navigation failures far from Russia's borders.",
      "In 2024, a plane carrying the British defense secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory, while a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the interference experienced by von der Leyen's plane was part of a complex campaign by Russia against Europe which could have \u201cpotentially disastrous effects.\u201d",
      "Satellite communications systems \u2014 known collectively as the Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS \u2014 receive precise time signals from satellites around 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) away in space. A smartphone, car, marine or aircraft navigation system compares how long it takes to receive signals from several different satellites to calculate an exact location.",
      "But the signals can be interfered with \u2014 commonly known as jamming or spoofing.",
      "Jamming means a receiver is overwhelmed by a strong radio signal transmitted in the same range where GNSS and other satellite navigation signals operate, leaving the receiver unable to fix a location or time. Spoofing involves transmitting fake signals which imitate a real GNSS satellite signal \u2014 commonly known as GPS \u2014 to mislead a phone, ship or aircraft into thinking it is in a different place.",
      "In a military context, jamming could be used to stop an incoming missile or drone attack, whereas the idea behind spoofing is to \u201ccreate deception,\u201d said Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "It's possible that Israel used spoofing technology to fly into Iranian airspace in June, when it killed top generals and struck nuclear sites, Withington suggested. Spoofing, he said, could have helped Israel deceive Iranian radar.",
      "Long before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities deployed spoofing technology around the Kremlin in Moscow, causing chaos for taxi drivers or other motorists using GPS.",
      "Russia \u201cdoes not mind\u201d if its own infrastructure is affected, as long as enemy activity is deterred, said Withington.",
      "In August, Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it had identified at least three hot spots for electronic interference along borders with Russia in the Kaliningrad, Leningrad and Pskov regions. All three regions host important Russian military bases.",
      "In April 2024, Finland's national carrier Finnair temporarily suspended flights to Tartu, Estonia after it said two of its planes were prevented from landing because of GPS disruptions. At that time, Tartu airport required approaching planes to use GPS to land, although planes have \u2014 and use \u2014 other forms of navigation.",
      "These include radio navigation and Inertial Navigation Systems, which determine where an aircraft \u2014 or submarine \u2014 is located by measuring its position in the air or water without relying on GPS.",

      "In December, Azerbaijan Airlines blamed a plane crash which killed 38 people on unspecified \u201cphysical and technical interference.\"",
      "Azerbaijan said the aircraft was hit by fire from the ground over southern Russia and rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.",
      "Russian officials said that at the time the aircraft was preparing to land in Grozny, Ukrainian drones were targeting the area around the airport.",
      "Bulgarian Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov said von der Leyen's plane was not specifically targeted and called the jamming a \u201cside effect\u201d of the war in Ukraine.",
      "Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it recorded 820 cases of interference with satellite signals in 2024, compared to 26 in 2022, and warned that the areas affected have recently \u201cexpanded significantly.\"",
      "In response, Baltic nations have banned drone flights in some areas near their borders with Russia and warned civilian drone pilots to assess signal stability before flying.",

      "Several states have complained about the electronic interference to the International Civil Aviation Organization but Russian officials dismissed the complaints and suggested they were politically motivated.",
      "While jamming and spoofing were initially aimed at protecting Russian infrastructure, authorities have realized the tactics have a useful \u201csecond order of effect, which is that it creates disruption and disquiet among the nations President (Vladimir) Putin perceives as being his enemy,\u201d said Withington.",
      "While countries along Russia's border appear to have largely mitigated the impact of Russian jamming in the air, there is potential for a serious incident at sea.",

      "Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator, uses AI to produce songs across various genres",
      "LONDON -- When pop groups and rock bands practice or perform, they rely on their guitars, keyboards and drumsticks to make music. Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator who goes by the stage name imoliver, fires up his chatbot.",
      "McCann's songs span a range of genres, from indie-pop to electro-soul to country-rap. There\u2019s just one crucial difference between McCann and traditional musicians.",
      "\u201cI have no musical talent at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t sing, I can\u2019t play instruments, and I have no musical background at all.\"",
      "McCann, 37, who has a background as a visual designer, started experimenting with AI to see if it could boost his creativity and \"bring some of my lyrics to life.\u201d Last month, he signed with independent record label Hallwood Media after one of his tracks racked up 3 million streams, in what's billed as the first time a music label has inked a contract with an AI music creator.",
      "McCann is an example of how ChatGPT-style AI song generation tools like Suno and Udio have spawned a wave of synthetic music. A movement most notably highlighted by a fictitious group, Velvet Sundown, that went viral even though all its songs, lyrics and album art were created by AI.",
      "It fueled debate about AI's role in music while raising fears about \"AI slop\" \u2014 automatically generated low quality mass produced content. It also cast a spotlight on AI song generators that are democratizing song making but threaten to disrupt the music industry.",
      "Experts say generative AI is set to transform the music world. However, there are scant details, so far, on how it's impacting the $29.6 billion global recorded music market, which includes about $20 billion from streaming.",
      "The most reliable figures come from music streaming service Deezer, which estimates that 18% of songs uploaded to its platform every day are purely AI generated, though they only account for a tiny amount of total streams, hinting that few people are actually listening. Other, bigger streaming platforms like Spotify haven't released any figures on AI music.",
      "Udio declined to comment on how many users it has and how many songs it has generated. Suno did not respond to a request for comment. Both have free basic levels as well as pro and premium tiers that come with access to more advanced AI models.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total boom. It\u2019s a tsunami,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of Ohio University's School of Media Arts and Studies. The amount of AI generated music \u201cis just going to only exponentially increase\u201d as young people grow up with AI and become more comfortable with it, he said.",
      "Yet generative AI, with its ability to spit out seemingly unique content, has divided the music world, with musicians and industry groups complaining that recorded works are being exploited to train AI models that power song generation tools.",
      "Record labels are trying to fend off the threat that AI music startups pose to their revenue streams even as they hope to tap into it for new earnings, while recording artists worry that it will devalue their creativity.",
      "Three major record companies, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records, filed lawsuits last year against Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. In June, the two sides also reportedly entered negotiations that could go beyond settling the lawsuits and set rules for how artists are paid when AI is used to remix their songs.",
      "GEMA, a German royalty collection society, has sued Suno, accusing it of generating music similar to songs like \u201cMambo No. 5\u201d by Lou Bega and \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville.",
      "More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn, released a silent album to protest proposed changes to U.K. laws on AI they fear would erode their creative control. Meanwhile, other artists, such as will.i.am, Timbaland and Imogen Heap, have embraced the technology.",
      "Some users say the debate is just a rehash of old arguments about once-new technology that eventually became widely used, such as AutoTune, drum machines and synthesizers.",

      "People complain \u201cthat you\u2019re using a computer to do all the work for you. I don\u2019t see it that way. I see it as any other tool that we have,\u201d said Scott Smith, whose AI band, Pulse Empire, was inspired by 1980s British synthesizer-driven groups like New Order and Depeche Mode.",
      "Smith, 56 and a semi-retired former U.S. Navy public affairs officer in Portland, Oregon, said \u201cmusic producers have lots of tools in their arsenal\u201d to enhance recordings that listeners aren't aware of.",
      "Like McCann, Smith never mastered a musical instrument. Both say they put lots of time and effort into crafting their music.",
      "Once Smith gets inspiration, it takes him just 10 minutes to write the lyrics. But then he'll spend as much as eight to nine hours generating different versions until the song \u201cmatches my vision.\u201d",
      "McCann said he'll often create up to 100 different versions of a song by prompting and re-prompting the AI system before he\u2019s satisfied.",
      "AI song generators can churn out lyrics as well as music, but many experienced users prefer to write their own words.",
      "\u201cAI lyrics tend to come out quite cliche and quite boring,\u201d McCann said.",
      "Lukas Rams, a Philadelphia-area resident who makes songs for his AI band Sleeping With Wolves, said AI lyrics tend to be \u201cextra corny\u201d and not as creative as a human, but can help get the writing process started.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll do very basic rhyme schemes, and it\u2019ll keep repeating the same structure,\u201d said Rams, who writes his own words, sometimes while putting his kids to bed and waiting for them to fall asleep. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll get words in there that are very telling of AI-generated lyrics, like \u2018neon,\u2019 anything with \u2018shadows\u2019.\u201d",
      "Rams used to play drums in high school bands and collaborated with his brother on their own songs, but work and family life started taking up more of his time.",
      "Then he discovered AI, which he used to create three albums for Sleeping With Wolves. He's been taking it seriously, making a CD jewel case with album art. He plans to post his songs, which combine metalcore and EDM, more widely online.",
      "\u201cI do want to start putting this up on YouTube or socials or distribution or whatever, just to have it out there,\u201d Rams said. \u201cI might as well, otherwise I\u2019m literally the only person that hears this stuff.\u201d",
      "Experts say AI's potential to let anyone come up with a hit song is poised to shake up the music industry's production pipeline.",
      "\"Just think about what it used to cost to make a hit or make something that breaks,\" Antonuccio said. \"And that just keeps winnowing down from a major studio to a laptop to a bedroom. And now it\u2019s like a text prompt \u2014 several text prompts.\u201d",
      "But he added that AI music is still in a \u201cWild West\u201d phase because of the lack of legal clarity over copyright. He compared it to the legal battles more than two decades ago over file-sharing sites like Napster that heralded the transition from CDs to digital media and eventually paved the way for today's music streaming services.",
      "Creators hope AI, too, will eventually become a part of the mainstream music world.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re entering a world where anyone, anywhere could make the next big hit,\u201d said McCann. \u201cAs AI becomes more widely accepted among people as a musical art form, I think it opens up the possibility for AI music to be featured in charts.\u201d",

      "Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they've proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.",
      "There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens more in northern California, and thousands roaming near the Great Lakes.",
      "The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers \u2014 and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They've turned to electrified fencing, wolf alarms, guard dogs, horseback patrols, trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approve killing wolves, including last week in Washington state.",
      "Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previous Associated Press review of data from state and federal agencies found.",
      "Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.",

But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a long-term solution,\u201d said Mary Rickert, the owner of a cattle ranch north of Mount Shasta. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that after some period of time, that all of a sudden they go, \u2018Wow, this isn\u2019t going to hurt me. It just makes a lot of noise.\u2019\u201d",

      "Online age checks are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, asking people for IDs or face scans to prove they are over 18 or 21 or even 13. To proponents, they're a tool to keep children away from adult websites and other material that might be harmful to them.",
      "But opponents see a worrisome trend toward a less secure, less private and less free internet, where people can be denied access not just to pornography but news, health information and the ability to speak openly and anonymously.",
      "\u201cI think that many of these laws come from a place of good intentions,\u201d said Jennifer Huddleston, a senior technology policy fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cCertainly we all want to protect young people from harmful content before they\u2019re ready to see it.\u201d",
      "More than 20 states have passed some kind of age verification law, though many face legal challenges. While no such law exists on the federal level in the United States, the Supreme Court recently allowed a Mississippi age check law for social media to stand. In June, the court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online, ruling that adults don't have a First Amendment right to access obscene speech without first proving their age.",
      "Elsewhere, the United Kingdom now requires users visiting websites that allow pornography to verify their age. Beyond adult sites, platforms like Reddit, X, Telegram and Bluesky have also committed to age checks. France and several other European Union countries also are testing a government sponsored verification app.",
      "And Australia has banned children under 16 from accessing social media.",
      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in November. The platforms have a year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.",
      "To critics, though, age check laws raise \u201csignificant privacy and speech concerns, not only for young people themselves, but also for all users of the internet,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cBecause the only way to make sure that we are age verifying anyone under the age of 18 is to also age verify everyone over the age 18. And that could have significant impacts on the speech and privacy rights of adults.\u201d",
      "The state laws are a hodgepodge of requirements, but they generally fall into two camps. On one side are laws \u2014 as seen in Louisiana and Texas \u2014 that require websites comprised of more than 33% of adult content to verify users' ages or face fines. Then there are laws \u2014 enacted in Wyoming or South Dakota \u2014 that seek to regulate sites that have any material that is considered obscene or otherwise harmful to minors.",
      "What's considered harmful to minors can be subjective, and this is where experts believe such laws run afoul of the First Amendment. It means people may be required to verify their ages to access anything, from Netflix to a neighborhood blog.",
      "\u201cIn places like Australia and the U.K., there is already a split happening between the internet that people who are willing to identify themselves or go through age verification can see and the rest of the internet. And that's historically a very dangerous place for us to end up,\u201d said Jason Kelley, activism director at the nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "What's behind the gates is determined by a \u201chundred different decision-makers,\" Kelley said, from politicians to tech platforms to judges to individuals who have sued because they believe that a piece of content is dangerous.",

      "While many companies are complying, verifying users' ages can prove a burden, especially for smaller platforms. On Friday, Bluesky said it will no longer be available in Mississippi because of its age verification requirements. While the social platform already does age verification in the U.K., it said Mississippi\u2019s approach \u201cwould fundamentally change how users access Bluesky.\u201d",
      "That's because it requires every user to undergo an age check, not just those who want to access adult content. It would also require Bluesky to identify and track users that are children.",
      "\u201cWe think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms,\u201d the company said in a blog post.",
      "Some websites and social media companies, such as Instagram's parent company Meta, have argued that age verification should be done by app store owners, such as Apple and Google, and not individual platforms. This would mean that app stores need to verify their users\u2019 ages before they allow them to download apps. Unsurprisingly, Apple and Google disagree.",
      "\u201cBilled as \u2018simple\u2019 by its backers, including Meta, this proposal fails to cover desktop computers or other devices that are commonly shared within families. It also could be ineffective against pre-installed apps,\u201d Google said in a blog post.",
      "Nonetheless, a growing number of tech companies are implementing verification systems to comply with regulations or ward off criticism that they are not protecting children. This includes Google, which recently started testing a new age-verification system for YouTube that relies on AI to differentiate between adults and minors based on their watch histories.",
      "Instagram is testing a similar AI system to determine if kids are lying about their ages. Roblox, which was sued by the Louisiana attorney general on claims it doesn't do enough to protect children from predators, requires users who want to access certain games rated for those over 17 to submit a photo ID and undergo a face scan for verification. Roblox has also recently begun requiring age verification for teens who want to chat more freely on platform.",
      "Face scans that promise to estimate a person\u2019s age may address some of the concerns around IDs, but they can be unreliable. Can AI accurately tell, for instance, if someone is 17.5 or just turned 18?",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s less accurate for women or it\u2019s less accurate for certain racial or ethnic groups or for certain physical characteristics that then may mean that those people have to go through additional privacy invasive screenings to prove that they are of a certain age,\u201d Huddleston said.",
      "While IDs are a common way of verifying someone\u2019s age, the method raises security concerns: What happens if companies don't delete the uploaded files, for instance?",
      "Case in point: the recent data breaches at Tea, an app for women to anonymously warn each other about the men they date, speak to some of these concerns. The app requires women who sign up to upload an ID or undergo a scan to prove that they are women. Tea wasn't supposed to keep the files but it did, and stored them in a way that allowed hackers to not only access the images, but also their private messages.",

      "Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.",

      "The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028.

      "In past surveys commissioned by Oregon's transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.",
      "Oregon's voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.",
      "Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.",
      "Many people don't realize that \"both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,\u201d said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.",
      "Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,\u201d Morgan said.",

      "FORT PIERCE, Fla. -- A man charged with trying to assassinate President Donald Trump last year in South Florida is set to represent himself during a pretrial conference on Tuesday, as final preparations are made for trial.",
      "Barring any delays, jury selection is scheduled to begin Sept. 8 in Fort Pierce federal court for the case against Ryan Routh. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon signed off on Routh\u2019s request to represent himself in July but said court-appointed attorneys need to remain as standby counsel.",
      "The trial will begin nearly a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted Routh's attempt to shoot Trump as he played golf. Routh, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Law enforcement obtained help from a witness who prosecutors said informed officers that he saw a person fleeing. The witness was then flown in a police helicopter to a nearby interstate where Routh was arrested, and the witnesses confirmed it was the person he had seen, prosecutors have said.",
      "The judge on Tuesday unsealed prosecutor's 33-page list of exhibits that could be introduced as evidence at the trial. It says prosecutors have photos of Routh holding the same model of semi-automatic rifle found at Trump's club.",
      "The document also lists numerous electronic messages sent from a cellphone investigators found in Routh's car. One message dated about two months before his arrest is described as Routh requesting a \u201cmissile launcher.\u201d It says that in August 2024, the month before his arrest, Routh sent messages seeking \u201chelp ensuring that (Trump) does not get elected\" and offering to pay an unnamed person to use flight tracking apps to check the whereabouts of Trump's airplane.",
      "The exhibit list cites evidence from Routh\u2019s phone of an electronic \u201cchat about sniper concealment\" during President John F. Kennedy's assassination. And it lists internet searches for how long gunpower residue stays on clothing and articles on U.S. Secret Service responses to assassination plots.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, is set to visit the White House on Wednesday, looking to strengthen his relationship with President Donald Trump and make the case that the U.S. needs to maintain its strong military presence in his country.",
      "The visit to Washington is Nawrocki's first overseas trip since taking office last month. It comes after Trump took the unusual step of involving himself in the elections of a longtime ally, Poland, and endorsing Nawrocki, the nationalist Law and Justice party candidate.",
      "Now in office, Nawrocki, a former amateur boxer and historian, is hoping to deepen his relationship with Trump at a fraught moment for Warsaw.",
      "Trump is increasingly frustrated by his inability to get Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to sit down for direct talks aimed at ending the more than three-year-old war between Poland's neighbors.",
      "Trump last month met with Putin in Alaska and then with Zelenskyy and several European leaders at the White House. He emerged from those engagements confident that he'd be able to quickly arrange direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy and perhaps three-way talks in which he would participate.",
      "But his optimism in hatching an agreement to end the war has dimmed as Putin has yet to signal an interest in sitting down with Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cMaybe they have to fight a little longer,\u201d Trump said in an interview with the conservative Daily Caller published over the weekend. \u201cYou know, just keep fighting \u2014 stupidly, keep fighting.\u201d",
      "There is also heightened anxiety in Poland, and Europe writ large, about Trump's long-term commitment to a robust U.S. force posture on the continent \u2014 an essential deterrent to Russia.",
      "Some key advisers in the Republican administration have advocated for shifting U.S. troops and military from Europe to the Indo-Pacific with China's lock as the United States' most significant strategic and economic competitor. Roughly 10,000 American troops are stationed in Poland on a rotational basis.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are very high for President Nawrocki's visit,\u201d said Peter Doran, an analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. \u201cTrump will have an opportunity to size up Poland\u2019s new president, and Nawrocki also will have the chance to do the same. Failure in this meeting would mean a pullback of American force posture in Poland, and success would mean a clear endorsement of Poland as one of America\u2019s most important allies on the front line.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear he wanted Nawrocki to win ahead of Poland's election this spring, dangling the prospect of closer military ties if the Poles elected Nawrocki.",

He has also accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity and vowed to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.",
      "At the same time, Nawrocki will be looking to stress to Trump that Russia aggression in Ukraine underscores that Putin can't be trusted and that a strong U.S. presence in Poland remains an essential deterrent, said Heather Conley, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, where she focuses on transatlantic security and geopolitics.",
      "Russia and its ally Belarus are set to hold joint military exercises this month in Belarus, unnerving Poland as well as fellow NATO members Latvia and Lithuania.",

      "The Democrat told reporters Tuesday, after welcoming children back to a public school in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan, that he'll be making calls to lawmakers and working on a plan over the next couple of days. Walz said he intends to propose a \u201cvery comprehensive\u201d package that could include an assault-weapons ban.",
      "But it's not clear if new restrictions on guns could pass the closely divided Minnesota Legislature. A special election this month is expected to restore a 67-67 tie in the House under a Republican speaker, and Senate Democrats have just a one-vote majority.",
      "\u201cTo be very candid, just in a very evenly divided (Legislature), I\u2019m going to need some Republicans to break with the orthodoxy and say that we need to do something on guns,\u201d Walz said.",

      "\u201cIf he decides to call a special session, anything that we do needs to have bipartisan support,\u201d Demuth said in a statement, noting that both parties showed they could work together in this year's regular session. \"If Governor Walz and Democrats are focused on partisan accusations and demands, this special session will not be productive for the people of Minnesota.\u201d",
      "Demuth indicated in an earlier statement that Republicans might be open to expanding school security funding to include private schools, and providing more money for mental health resources.",
      "While the governor didn't give many details of his proposals, he said they won't infringe on Second Amendment rights, but will protect students.

      "Across the country, tens of thousands of college students without legal status are losing access to in-state tuition as part of an immigration crackdown carried out by President Donald Trump and his allies",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Carlie was hoping to spend her senior year savoring her final moments on the palm tree-lined campus of the University of Central Florida. Instead, she sits at home alone, logging on to online courses, afraid to leave her apartment and run the risk of being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "A few months ago, Carlie was studying public relations in Orlando, envisioning one day working for nonprofits that help students like her. Thanks to in-state tuition and private scholarships, Carlie had been living a life she had only dreamed of in Haiti, a country she left behind at 13 years old.",
      "Now, she's one of thousands of Florida students whose education is being delayed or derailed after state lawmakers revoked a 2014 law that let residents who are in the country illegally qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities.",
      "Across the country, tens of thousands of college students without legal status are losing access to in-state tuition as part of an immigration crackdown carried out by President Donald Trump and his allies.",
      "\u201cIt feels like all my hard work means nothing. Like, one day I can just lose it,\u201d said Carlie, who spoke on condition of being identified by only her first name because she fears being deported.",
      "When Florida lawmakers passed the tuition waiver law more than a decade ago, it was a bipartisan effort championed by then-state Rep. Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, a Miami Republican who went on to become Gov. Ron DeSantis' lieutenant governor. That a decade later Nu\u00f1ez would support dismantling what had been one of her signature achievements is a sign of how much the state's immigration politics have shifted toward Trump's priorities.",
      "According to state data, more than 6,500 students qualified for what\u2019s known as the out-of-state tuition waiver during the 2023-2024 school year. That waiver was revoked as of July 1, after DeSantis signed the bill repealing the tuition cuts.",
      "The cost difference is substantial. At the flagship University of Florida, a state resident is estimated to pay about $6,380 in tuition for the 2025-2026 academic year compared with about $30,900 for a nonresident student. Housing, transportation and other expenses can add another $17,000 or more.",
      "Florida's state colleges and universities don't specifically track the enrollment of students without legal status, but some immigrant advocates say they expect fewer students to attend in-person classes, and many to give up on college altogether.",
      "Diego Dulanto Falcon earned a bachelor's in psychology thanks to the tuition waiver. Now he's pursuing his master's in public health at the University of South Florida.",
      "In losing access to in-state tuition, Dulanto Falcon said students without legal status are being cut off from a range of opportunities.",
      "\u201cFully undocumented students, they have absolutely no options,\u201d Dulanto Falcon said. \u201cThey either work under the table or they just don\u2019t work at all.\u201d",
      "Going to high school in Miami, David stacked his schedule with dual enrollment and Advanced Placement classes. He hoped to attend college and become a radiologist or physical therapist. David, who was born in Honduras, said that now feels impossible for students like him without legal status. While his friends went off to universities like Duke and Florida State, David went to work at McDonald's.",
      "He spoke on condition of being identified only by his middle name because he fears deportation.",
      "\u201cWhen you come into this country and your parents make the sacrifice and you\u2019re a kid, all they tell you is focus on school,\u201d David said. \u201cI did just that.\u201d",
      "But now, without the tuition waver, he said he can't afford college.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Curtis Sliwa, the colorful creator of New York City's Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol group, ran for mayor four years ago and wound up losing to Democrat Eric Adams by almost 40 percentage points.",

      "\u201cZohran obviously is very unique. He's way to the left, but then again, Cuomo and Adams, listen to the way they talk. They're Zohran-lite,\" Sliwa told The Associated Press. \u201cI will be the alternative.\u201d",
      "Even if he doesn't win, Sliwa might play the spoiler. While some Mamdani critics have urged Sliwa to drop out and throw his support behind someone with a better chance of beating the Democratic nominee, Sliwa says that isn't happening.",
      "Sliwa is hoping to ride to victory on crime, an issue that helped Adams, a former police captain, win the pandemic-era 2021 election.",
      "This year's Democratic primary was dominated by discussions of New York's high cost of living, but Sliwa believes crime is \"beginning to creep up and almost be equal\u201d to other issues voters care about.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal grand jurors in the nation's capital have refused to indict two people who were charged separately with threatening to kill President Donald Trump, more evidence of a growing backlash against Trump's law enforcement intervention in Washington, D.C.",
      "It is extraordinarily rare for a grand jury to balk at returning an indictment, but it has happened at least seven times in five cases since Trump last month ordered a surge in patrols by federal agents and troops in the District of Columbia. One of the instances involved the case against a man charged with hurling a sandwich at a federal agent.",
      "The latest example occurred Tuesday, when Justice Department prosecutors told a magistrate judge that a grand jury declined to indict Edward Alexander Dana. He is accused of making a death threat against Trump while in police custody on Aug. 17. Dana also told police that he was intoxicated that night.",
      "Grand jurors also refused to hand up an indictment against Nathalie Rose Jones, who was arrested Aug. 16 in Washington on charges that she made death threats against Trump on social media and during an interview with Secret Service agents. Jones' attorney disclosed the decision in a court filing Monday.",
      "Dana's lawyer, Elizabeth Mullin, said she has never seen anything like this in over 20 years as a public defender in Washington. She said prosecutors are responding to Trump's surge by bringing \u201cweak cases\u201d that don't belong in federal court.",
      "\u201cAnd the grand juries are seeing through it,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cIt's a huge waste in resources.\u201d",
      "U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, whom Trump appointed to be the top federal prosecutor for Washington, said a grand jury\u2019s refusal to indict somebody for threatening to kill the president \u201cis the essence of a politicized jury.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe system here is broken on many levels,\u201d Pirro said in a statement. \u201cInstead of the outrage that should be engendered by a specific threat to kill the president, the grand jury in DC refuses to even let the judicial process begin. Justice should not depend on politics.\u201d",
      "Last month, a grand jury refused to indict a government attorney who was facing a felony assault charge for throwing a \u201csub-style\u201d sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent \u2014 a confrontation captured on a viral video.",

Payments would be spread over 30 years, or a winner can choose an immediate lump sum of $453 million, again before taxes.",

      "A new AP-NORC poll finds that while most Democrats disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue, a large majority, 68%, see crime as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in large cities",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "Democrat Eric McWilliams doesn't approve of Donald Trump sending National Guard troops to cities like Washington, D.C. And he's certainly not supportive of most of the president's policies.",
      "But the 63-year old retired handyman and U.S. Navy veteran does praise Trump for one thing. \u201cWhen it comes to crime,\" he said, \u201cHe\u2019s alright. He's doing pretty good. How he\u2019s doing it is another matter.\u201d",
      "\u201cCrime is a big problem,\u201d he went on. \u201cAt least he is doing something.\u201d",
      "McWilliams' views reflect the thinking of a lot of Democrats, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. It finds that while most disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue, a large majority, 68%, see crime as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in large cities. That's despite the fact that statistics show crime, overall, is down across the nation, with some cities reporting 30-year lows.",
      "The findings underscore the challenge facing Democratic leaders. They must thread the needle between criticizing Trump's policies, which are deeply unpopular among their base, while at the same time not dismissing widespread concerns about safety, which are amplified in many news sources and in online forums like Facebook and the popular Nextdoor app.",
      "That could create a vulnerability for the party heading into next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "While Trump remains unpopular overall, the new poll finds his approach to crime has earned him high marks compared to other issues like the economy and immigration. About half of U.S. adults, 53%, say they approve of his handling of crime.",
      "The vast majority of Americans, 81%, also see crime as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in large cities. That includes nearly all Republicans, roughly three-quarters of independents and nearly 7 in 10 Democrats.",
      "The issue is complex, though, even for those who are concerned. In interviews, participants who oppose Trump\u2019s unprecedented takeover of Washington, D.C.\u2019s police department and threats to expand his efforts to other cities expressed alarm, calling his actions anti-American and part of what they see as an effort to distract the public from issues the White House would prefer they ignore.",
      "They believe resources would be better spent investing in community policing, mental health services and passing meaningful laws to get guns off city streets.",
      "But many also bemoaned the state of public safety in the country, even if they said they felt safe in their own neighborhoods and acknowledged that violent crime is down after a pandemic-era spike. Several noted that they or their neighbors had been the victims of serious crimes and complained about what they felt was a lackluster police response.",
      "Brian Cornelia, 62, a retired foreman and lifelong Democrat who lives in Michigan, near Marquette, is displeased with the performance of both parties.",
      "\u201cDefund the police was nuts,\" he said. \u201cNow with Trump what he\u2019s doing, that\u2019s nuts too.\"",
      "He said that crime is \u201cnot at all\u201d an issue where he lives and \u201cdown all over,\" but nonetheless appreciates that Trump is doing something.",
      "\"Something is happening. We\u2019ll see if it helps or not, but it's better than not doing anything,\" he said. Either way, he said Trump had backed Democrats into a corner.",
      "\u201cIt's bad. How are you going to say you don't want crime to be dealt with?\" he said. \u201cIf you argue with him, what, you\u2019re soft on crime? It\u2019s a Catch-22.\"",
      "Even those who give Trump credit question his tactics.",
      "About 8 in 10 Democrats say it\u2019s \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unacceptable for the president to seize control of local police departments, as he\u2019s done in Washington. And about 6 in 10 say it\u2019s unacceptable for the federal government to use the U.S. military and National Guard to assist local police.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t approve of national troops having authority over fellow Americans,\u201d said McWilliams, the Navy veteran. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t use our armed forces to patrol our own people. That turns it into an authoritarian state.\u201d",
      "McWilliams, who lives in White Hall, Pennsylvania, said crime \u201cis practically non-existent\u201d in his neighborhood, where he doesn't even lock his door. But he worries about the situation in nearby Allentown and across the nation, noting the deadly mass shooting this week at a Minneapolis church.",

      "\u201cEvery time I pull into my garage, I pinch myself,\u201d Colley said.",
      "Now, President Donald Trump wants to eliminate that grant, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, and House Republicans overseeing federal budget negotiations did not include funding for it in their budget proposal. Experts and state housing agencies say that would set back tens of thousands of future affordable housing developments nationwide, particularly hurting Appalachian towns and rural counties where government aid is sparse and investors are few.",
      "The program has helped build or repair more than 1.3 million affordable homes in the last three decades, of which at least 540,000 were in congressional districts that are rural or significantly rural, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal data.",
      "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t realize how far-reaching these programs are,\u201d said Colley, who voted for Trump in 2024. Among those half a million homes that HOME helped build, 84% were in districts that voted for him last year, the AP analysis found.",
      "\u201cI understand we don\u2019t want excessive spending and wasting taxpayer dollars,\" Colley said, \"but these proposed budget cuts across the board make me rethink the next time I go to the polls.\u201d",
      "The HOME program, started under President George H. W. Bush in the 1990s, survived years of budget battles but has been stretched thin by years of rising construction costs and stagnant funding. That's meant fewer units, including in some rural areas where home prices have grown faster than in cities.",
      "The program has spent more than $38 billion nationwide since it began filling in funding gaps and attracting more investment to acquire, build and repair affordable homes, HUD data shows. Additional funding has gone toward projects that have yet to be finished and rental assistance.",
      "To account for the gap left by the proposed cuts, House Republicans want to draw on nearly $5 billion from a related pandemic-era fund that gave states until 2030 to spend on projects supporting people who are unhoused or facing homelessness.",
      "That $5 billion, however, may be far less, since many projects haven\u2019t yet been logged into the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's tracking system, according to state housing agencies and associations representing them.",

      "That includes affordable units built in cities. The biggest program that funds affordable rental housing nationwide, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, uses HOME grants for 12% of units, totaling 324,000 current individual units, according to soon-to-be-published Urban Institute research.",

But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.",
      "The Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations.

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board has raised alarms among economists and legal experts who see it as the biggest threat to the central bank's independence in decades.",
      "The consequences could impact most Americans' everyday lives: Economists worry that if Trump gets what he wants \u2014 a loyal Fed that sharply cuts short-term interest rates \u2014 the result would likely be higher inflation and, over time, higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages, car loans and business loans.",
      "Trump on Monday sought to fireLisa Cook, the first Black woman appointed to the Fed's seven-member governing board. It was the first time in the Fed's 112-year history that a president has tried to fire a governor.",
      "Trump said he was doing so because of allegations raised by one of his appointees that she has committed mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook has argued in a lawsuit seeking to block her firing that the claims are a pretext for Trump's true goal: Gaining more control over the Fed. A court may decide next week whether to temporarily block Cook\u2019s firing while the case makes its way through the legal process.",
      "Cook is accused of claiming two homes as primary residences in July 2021, before she joined the board, which could have led to a lower mortgage rate than if one had been classified as a second home or an investment property. She has suggested in her lawsuit that it may have been a clerical error but hasn\u2019t directly responded to the accusations.",
      "Trump and members of his administration have made no secret about their desire to exert more control over the Fed. Trump has repeatedly demanded that the central bank cut its key rate to as low as 1.3%, from its current level of 4.3%.",
      "Before trying to fire Cook, Trump repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting the short-term interest rate and threatened to fire him as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll have a majority very shortly, so that\u2019ll be good,\u201d Trump said Tuesday, a reference to the fact that if he is able to replace Cook his appointees will control the Fed's board by a 4-3 vote.",
      "\u201cThe particular case of Governor Cook is not as important as what this latest move shows about the escalation in the assaults on the Fed,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins and former adviser to Powell. \u201cIn my view, Fed independence really now hangs by a thread.\u201d",
      "Some economists do think the Fed should cut more quickly, though virtually none agree with Trump that it should do so by 3 percentage points. Powell has signaled the Fed is likely to cut by a quarter point in September.",
      "The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls \u2014 which it typically does when the economy falters \u2014 the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, growth, and hiring. When it raises the rate to combat the higher prices that come with inflation, it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.",
      "Most economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can take unpopular steps that elected officials are more likely to avoid. Economic research has shown that nations with independent central banks typically have lower inflation over time.",
      "Elected officials like Trump, however, have much greater incentives to push for lower interest rates, which make it easier for Americans to buy homes and cars and would boost the economy in the short run.",
      "Douglas Elmendorf, an economist at Harvard and former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said that Trump's demand for the Fed to cut its key rate by 3 percentage points would overstimulate the economy, lifting consumer demand above what the economy can produce and boosting inflation \u2014 similar to what happened during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cIf the Federal Reserve falls under control of the president, then we\u2019ll end up with higher inflation in this country probably for years to come,\u201d Elmendorf said.",

      "In Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan forced the central bank to keep interest rates low in the early 2020s, even as inflation spiked to 85%. In 2023, Erdogan allowed the central bank more independence, which has helped bring down inflation, but short-term interest rates rose to 50% to fight inflation, and are still 46%.",
      "Other U.S. presidents have badgered the Fed. President Lyndon Johnson harassed then-Fed Chair William McChesney Martin in the mid-1960s to keep rates low as Johnson ramped up government spending on the Vietnam War and antipoverty programs. And Richard Nixon pressured then-Chair Arthur Burns to avoid rate hikes in the run-up to the 1972 election. Both episodes are widely blamed for leading to the stubbornly high inflation of the 1960s and '70s.",
      "Trump has also argued that the Fed should lower its rate to make it easier for the federal government to finance its tremendous $37 trillion debt load. Yet that threatens to distract the Fed from its congressional mandates of keeping inflation and unemployment low.",
      "Presidents do have some influence over the Fed through their ability to appoint members of the board, subject to Senate approval. But the Fed was created to be insulated from short-term political pressures. Fed governors are appointed to staggered, 14-year terms to ensure that no single president can appoint too many.",
      "Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University, said there is a reason that Congress decided to create independent agencies like the Fed: They preferred \u201cdecisions that are made from a kind of objective, neutral vantage point grounded in expertise rather than decisions are that are wholly subject to political pressure.\u201d",
      "Yet some Trump administration officials say they want more democratic accountability at the Fed.",
      "In an interview with USA Today Vice President JD Vance said, \u201cWhat people who are saying the president has no authority here are effectively saying is that seven economists and lawyers should be able to make an incredibly critical decision for the American people with no democratic input.\u201d",
      "And Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, wrote a paper last year advocating for a restructuring of the Fed, including making it much easier for a president to fire governors.",
      "The \u201coverall goal of this design is delivering the economic benefits\u201d of an independent central bank, Miran wrote, \u201cwhile maintaining a level of accountability that a democratic society must demand.\" Trump has nominated Miran to the Fed's board to replace Adriana Kugler, who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1.",
      "Trump has personally insulted Powell for months, but his administration now appears much more focused on the Fed\u2019s broader structure.",
      "The Fed makes its interest rate decisions through a committee that consists of the seven governors, including Powell, as well as the 12 presidents of regional Fed banks in cities such as New York, Kansas City, and Atlanta. Five of those presidents vote on rates at each meeting. The New York Fed president has a permanent vote, while four others vote on a rotating basis.",
      "While the reserve banks' boards choose their presidents, the Fed board in Washington can vote to reject them. All 12 presidents will need to be reappointed and approved by the board in February, which could become more contentious if the board votes down one or more of the 12 presidents.",
      "\u201cThe nuclear scenario is ... the reappointment of the reserve bank presidents and interfering with that, (which) would be the signal that things are truly going off the rails,\" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

    "story": [
      "The case against Long Island\u2019s suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer has emerged as a potentially precedent-setting battleground in the use of advanced DNA techniques in criminal cases",
      "RIVERHEAD, N.Y. -- When Maureen Brainard-Barnes\u2019 skeletal remains were found hidden in the roadside scrub near Long Island's Gilgo Beach in the winter of 2010, there was hardly any physical evidence that might help investigators find her killer, save for a single stray hair.",
      "But at the time, extracting DNA evidence from the degraded strand was beyond the capabilities of crime labs. Investigators kept looking for other clues that might help them identify a suspected serial killer who had scattered women's bodies along a coastal parkway.",
      "Then, about seven years ago, investigators turned to Astrea Forensics, a California lab using new techniques to analyze old, highly degraded DNA samples \u2014 including rootless hairs like the one discovered with Brainard-Barnes' body.",
      "Now, that lab\u2019s work is the focus of a pivotal decision in the closely watched case. A state judge is weighing whether to allow the DNA evidence generated through Astrea Forensics\u2019 whole genome sequencing into the trial of Rex Heuermann, who is accused of killing 25-year-old Brainard-Barnes and six other women.",
      "If allowed, it would mark the first time such techniques could be admitted in a New York court, and one of just a handful of such instances nationwide, according to prosecutors, defense lawyers and experts.",
      "Prosecutors say Astrea's findings, combined with other evidence, overwhelmingly implicate Heuermann, 61, as the killer.",
      "But lawyers for the Manhattan architect argue the company's calculations exaggerate the likelihood that the hairs recovered from the burial sites match their client.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the pressure that\u2019s on this judge because he\u2019s probably more than likely making a ruling that will set the stage for all the cases that come after,\u201d said April Stonehouse, a DNA forensics expert at Arizona State University who is not involved in the case.",
      "DNA analysis is no longer new, but the tests typically used by criminal labs across the country have limitations.",
      "Astrea is one of a small but growing number of private labs that say they are capable of taking extremely short DNA fragments found in very old bones and hair and using them to reconstruct a person's entire genetic sequence, or genome.",
      "During court testimony, experts called by the Suffolk County District Attorney's office highlighted how scientists use similar techniques in a wide range of scientific and medical work, such as mapping the genome of the Neanderthal \u2014 an effort awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Medicine.",
      "Astrea Forensics' co-founder, Dr. Richard Green, described in court how his lab\u2019s whole genome sequencing results were allowed as evidence in last year\u2019s trial and conviction of David Allen Dalrymple in the cold-case murder of 9-year-old Daralyn Johnson in Idaho.",
      "Heuermann\u2019s lawyers argue that Astrea\u2019s DNA methods haven't been subjected to enough scrutiny yet, and warned they needed more evaluation because they had the potential to \u201cdramatically reshape\u201d how forensics is used in criminal trials.",
      "They zeroed in on the statistical analysis Green\u2019s lab conducted on the DNA profiles it generated from the hairs recovered from the victims\u2019 remains, saying it was potentially overstating the likelihood that a mapped genome was a match with any particular person.",
      "For its calculations, Astrea Forensics uses reference data from an open-source database containing the full DNA sequence of some 2,500 people worldwide, called the 1,000 Genomes Project.",
      "Dr. Dan Krane, a professor at Wright State University in Ohio, testified for the defense that Astrea Forensics' methods were \u201cwildly and unfairly prejudicial.\"",

      "\u201cThe bottom line is that there are genuine scientific concerns with the way that the statistics are computed, but not with the laboratory techniques,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concerns are real, but the likelihood ratios still look very damning for the defense, no matter how they are computed.\u201d",

    "summary": "North Carolina was pummeled by TCU, 48-14, in the college coaching debut of NFL coaching legend Bill Belichick.",
    "story": [
      "Chapel Hill, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina's high-point moment in its first game under coach Bill Belichick came early.",
      "A festive pregame atmosphere led to a roar from the crowd at kickoff. And a season-opening drive moved at a crisp pace to the end zone.",
      "After that, well, Monday night's hyped-up debut turned into a romp by TCU - along with a reminder that even an NFL icon with six Super Bowl titles as a head coach can't just magically turn the Tar Heels into winners after decades of also-ran status.",
      "\"We played competitively but then just couldn't sustain it,\" Belichick said in the familiar low tone from his NFL news conferences after the 48-14 loss. \"Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We need to do a better job all the way around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game.\"",
      "CBSSports.com's Shehan Jeyarajah points out\u00a0that, \"The NFL is generally a defensive league where teams are close to evenly matched. At the college level, Belichick will come to understand just how big the talent differentials are between the good and bad teams \u2014 and he was on the wrong end.\"",
      "The blowout put a major damper on a night buzzing with optimism for the 73-year-old Belichick's college debut, only to see the Horned Frogs dominate so thoroughly they drove UNC fans to the Kenan Stadium exits by midway through the third quarter.",
      "\"It was a great environment tonight,\" Belichick said. \"I mean, the fans were awesome. There was great energy in the stadium. We just didn't do enough to keep it going. We've got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\"",
      "By the end of the game, Kenan was a ghost town and the Tar Heels had given up more points than in any previous opener in their history, according to Sportradar.",
      "It was a jarring result, even amid uncertainty as to exactly what to expect from UNC with roughly 70 new players between transfers and incoming recruits. There were few highlights after that opening drive beyond Kaleb Cost's athletic reeling in of a deflected ball for an interception and quarterback Max Johnson returning in relief from a serious leg injury sustained in last year's opener at Minnesota.",
      "\"We're just moving forward, just moving forward,\" said Cost, offering an unintentional callback to Belichick's famous \"We're on to Cincinnati\" response to reporters' questions after a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014.",
      "UNC was picked to finish eighth in the 17-team Atlantic Coast Conference, though that seemed almost entirely predicated on Belichick's mere presence. This is a man, after all, who teamed with legendary quarterback Tom Brady to win six world titles in his 24-year run with the New England Patriots. Someone who won more regular-season and playoff games in the NFL (333) than anyone other than Don Shula.",
      "So there was spectacle to Belichick's debut as he took the field sporting a familiar look from the pro sideline with a gray hoodie - only this one bearing the name \"Carolina Football\" in that distinctive shade of light blue.",
      "An estimated 5,000 fans packed onto a main campus quad for a pregame concert and throngs lined the team's walk to Kenan, where UNC has sold out all its season tickets \u2014 at an elevated price with Belichick's arrival \u2014 and single-game seats for the season. The game attracted ESPN to hold a pregame studio show from the sideline with a crew that included former Alabama coach Nick Saban, with Belichick popping over briefly to say hello.",
      "There were notable former UNC athletes from years past, including NBA legend Michael Jordan \u2014 who won a national championship under Dean Smith here in 1982 \u2014 and former UNC star linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who played under Belichick when he was an assistant and eventually defensive coordinator with the New York Giants during the 1980s.",
      "And it wasn't hard to spot Jordon Hudson \u2014 Belichick's 24-year-old girlfriend who has generated her own tabloid-level curiosity \u2014 as she walked the pregame sideline sporting Carolina blue pants shimmering with sequins-like additions on the legs.",
      "Belichick roamed the field during pregame warmups for the better part of a half-hour. At one point, he stood on the UNC end of the field with general manager Michael Lombardi, then shared a quick handshake with ACC commissioner Jim Phillips as he made his way toward midfield.",
      "Once there, Belichick shook hands with members of the officiating crew and watched the Horned Frogs warm up.",
      "The Tar Heels got off to a sprint of a start with an 83-yard drive that ended with Caleb Hood scoring through the right side from 8 yards out, followed by forcing a quick punt. But things soon started getting away.",
      "TCU \u2014 which lost in a similar scenario as the \"other\" team in Deion Sanders' debut at Colorado two years ago \u2014 never looked rattled or thrown. Bud Clark provided a highlight by jumping Gio Lopez's sideline throw for an easy 25-yard pick-six as TCU took a 20-7 lead into the break.",
      "It quickly got worse after halftime. Kevorian Barnes sprinted through the right side and down the sideline for a 75-yard touchdown on the first snap. Trent Battle added his own big run, slipping through the left side untouched and going 28 yards for a TD.",
      "And finally, Devean Deal had a 37-yard scoop-and-score on Lopez's fumble to make it 41-7 and start the Kenan exodus.",
      "By the end, UNC had just 222 total yards, 320 fewer than TCU, and a short week to fix problems before visiting Charlotte on Saturday.",
      "\"They were clearly the better team tonight,\" Belichick said. \"They deserved to win and they did it decisively.\"",

    "summary": "One of the founding members of Creedence Clearwater Revival lost control of his own songs when the band broke up in the early 1970s. Now, after buying back rights to his Creedence catalog, John Fogerty has come back to his music, recording the album \"Legacy.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It was life and death,\" said musician John Fogerty. \"I used to tell myself that phrase: 'This is life and death.' You're against the whole world.\"",
      "He felt that as a young man: \"Yes, oh yes. I mean, there's a million records out there. It's me against everybody that's every recorded and ever will record. You've got to do a great job. It was either be great, or go home!\"",
      "You know how it turned out for Fogerty. \"Great\" is something of an understatement. That voice \u2026 that guitar \u2026 and those songs, so many of which became hits that are now classics. But Fogerty, who recently turned 80, says every time he steps up to the mic, he still has something to prove \u2013 and still feel a little nerve. \"Oh yeah, yeah, every time!\" he laughed. \"But I think the nerves is what gives you the edge.",
      "I asked, \"How do you do that? What's the magic there?\"",
      "\"I wish I had a really great, contrived answer for you, but I don't!\" he laughed.",
      "The answer seems quite simple when you watch Fogerty rehearse. There is love of craft, and love of family. (His sons, Shane and Tyler Fogerty, help lead his touring band.)",
      "The group that put Fogerty on the charts was Creedence Clearwater Revival, which got its start in the late 1950s. Though a native of Northern California, Fogerty soaked up the rhythms of the South, giving birth to his so-called \"swamp rock\" sound, which he honed in the mid-'60s.",
      "He recalled: \"I received my honorable discharge from the Army. And the first line I wrote was, 'Left a good job in the city, workin' for the man every night and day.' Well, of course that was the Army. I mean, it had just happened. But as I begin to strum, I started singing this phrase: 'Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.' And at that point I'm, Well, what is this song? What is this? And I went to this songbook that I had just started keeping, and on the very first page, the very first entry, I had written the words 'Proud Mary.'",
      "\"And I actually understood right then that I'd written a classic song, a really great, American song,\" he said. \"And a few moments later, 'Oh my God. What if I never get to do this again? What if this is the only one that ever happens, and I'm a one-hit wonder?'\"",
      "Turns out, Fogerty was anything but that. Yet, after the 1972 breakup of Creedence, his solo career became mired in legal battles. He was stunned to discover he no longer had control over the use of the songs he wrote \u2013 and a limited share of the profits.",
      "Fogerty has looked on as others have endured similar challenges, and pain. The most famous current example: Taylor Swift, who earlier this year purchased the rights to her compositions, and won back control of her music.",
      "I asked, \"If you could pull her aside, John, and give her a piece of advice about how to get over the pain of a fight over your own music, what would you tell her?\"",
      "\"Well, I don't think you get over that kind of fight,\" he replied. \"What happened to me is, I stopped touring, and I stopped singing my own songs. I don't recommend that move to anybody. You become invisible. You're just forgotten about. It's like you died.\"",
      "I asked Julie, his wife of 34 years, if she ever doubted that he would be able to pull himself out of that anger. \"I think it was more sadness than anger,\" she said. \"And all he ever wanted to do in life was make music. That was his love. That was his best friend. And having that taken away and turned so bad was really hard for me to understand.\"",
      "Fogerty gives Julie credit for turning his life around. And she encouraged him not only to buy back the rights to his Creedence catalog, but to re-record those songs with his sons.\u00a0 The result: a new album, \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version).\"",
      "Julie said, \"Having those songs and being able to put his fist in the air and go, 'I own those songs,' I couldn't think of a better gift than having him record these with friends and family.\"",
      "You can stream John Fogerty's album \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)\" by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "Since they were children, sons Shane and Tyler learned guitar from their father.\u00a0 The new album is a family affair, but it's also serious business. \"I have the feeling that somehow Julie knew, she knew that at some point, the life-and-death John would kick in and I would have to roll up my sleeves,\" Fogerty said. \"'Cause that's what happened. And literally, this was kind of when the record was done, I think she told me, she said she could see me going back in time. With each one of these tracks, especially when I was doing the lead vocal, I had to remember what I felt like when I sang it the first time.\"",
      "And what a time it has been. For John Fogerty, the highs and lows have landed him here: at peace with it all, and lucky enough to have his songs still playing.",
      "I asked, \"What's it like for you to hear your music everywhere, even now?\"",
      "\"I don't know the exact right words; I can almost not believe it actually happened, or that that was me,\" he said. \"It's a prideful thing. I think it makes you feel really happy that you are able to tune into the radio station that God delivers, you know, and receive a song like 'Proud Mary,' and write it down, and even take credit for it, right? And then have it go around the world like that? It's kind of too much to really be able to grab hold of.\"",

    "summary": "A master of figurative art is now focused on the work of other artists, gifting a collection of more than 100 paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
    "story": [
      "When Alex Katz began painting more than 75 years ago, he ignored what was popular then, to pursue his passion: figurative art. \"Most people didn't like my work,\" he said. \"It was figurative, and everyone was abstract, and everything was pop art. But a lotta people didn't like it.\"",
      "But he says he didn't care that much what they thought: \"If they liked it, swell. And if they didn't like it, go to hell.\"",
      "Katz depicts recognizable figures and objects from the real world. Using unfussy backgrounds and large areas of color, he emphasizes shapes and outlines, and paints massive pieces, often with his wife, Ada, as his subject. \"I did the figures on a flat ground,\" he said. \"I did the double portraits of Ada. I did the big heads before anyone. And that's really aggressive. And the big compositions. No one had done anything like it.\"",
      "Katz grew up in Queens, New York, and attended the Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture in Maine. He's been honing his technique ever since.",
      "In 1986, \"Sunday Morning\" documented his artistic process:",
      "These days, the art world has caught up to Alex Katz's talent. His paintings can sell for millions of dollars, and exhibitions around the world have highlighted his work, including a show in 2022 at New York's Guggenheim Museum.",
      "Now famed for his portraits, Katz is also highly-regarded for his landscapes, often inspired by the picturesque scenes near his summer studio in Maine. \"It's a long way from Queens,\" he said, \"but it is like Queens. It's all kinda small!\"",
      "Katz says painting the outdoors heightened his creativity: \"I thought I was connecting with outdoor painting, but actually I was connecting with myself,\" he said. \"The painting was no longer cerebral. It was coming from the inside.\"",
      "This summer, Katz turned 98, and after a lifetime painting, he's focused on the work of other artists. He gifted a collection of more than a hundred paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
      "\"As the art world has moved in different ways and fashions, Alex has always stayed true to his self,\" said museum director Mark Bessire. \"I see his love of artists taking chance and his love of artists emanating that sense of energy that he likes in a painting. He doesn't like a painting because it looks like his or it's figurative. He likes it 'cause it's got the energy, and it pops.\"",
      "The exhibit is called \"Painting Energy.\"",
      "Asked to describe the sensation of looking at some of those paintings, Katz replied, \"It's just like a pow! You get it right through the air. It's very quick. Sometimes you can get a whole show \u2013 as they open the elevator door, blink, and they shut it, you know what this painting's about.\"",
      "One painting that gave Katz that \"pow\" was Katherine Bradford's \"Shadows.\"",
      "Bradford said that when she learned Katz had bought one of her paintings, \"I just felt, 'Oh, wow! Maybe I am a little good!' And Alex Katz, he certainly is really good. Good eye, good person.\"",
      "Bradford didn't start painting until her 30s. Now she's 83, and her pieces typically sell for tens of thousands of dollars. \"Alex Katz is a leader in contemporary art,\" she said. \"But in the state of Maine, he's king. And we all look up to him. He decided to use what he had gained to give back to artists, to buy artists' work.\"",
      "Asked why he wanted to collect other artists' paintings, Katz said, \"Well, I wanted to help other people who went through the same difficulty that I did, you know? I know every little help I got in that period from 25-35, I really appreciated.\"",
      "Like when a paint manufacturer who recognized Katz's talent early on gave him art supplies as part of a deal: \"He got five or six little paintings, and I had free paints,\" said Katz. \"But the big thing was someone believed there was something in me.\"",
      "Katz still works seven days a week, and is still taking risks. \"Sometime, in about a week, I'll do the first painting of a new series,\" he said.",
      "\"And you seem excited about that?\" I asked.",
      "\"Excited and frightened,\" he laughed. \"Yeah, I'm scared it really won't work out.\"",
      "\"So, after all that you've accomplished, you still worry?\"",
      "\"Uh-huh. I want to go where I'm scared. And the new things might be better, they might be worse, but I have to do 'em.\"",

      "She chose September, that most excellent month, to make her move. The monsoon had receded, leaving Kerala gleaming like an emerald strip between the mountains and the sea. As the plane banked to land, and the earth rose to greet us, I couldn't believe that topography could cause such palpable, physical pain. I had never known that beloved landscape, never imagined it, never evoked it, without her being part of it. I couldn't think of those hills and trees, the green rivers, the shrinking, cemented-over rice fields with giant billboards rising out of them advertising awful wedding saris and even worse jewelry, without thinking of her. She was woven through it all, taller in my mind than any billboard, more perilous than any river in spate, more relentless than the rain, more present than the sea itself. How could this have happened? How? She checked out with no advance notice. Typically unpredictable.",
      "The church didn't want her. She didn't want the church. (There was savage history there, nothing to do with God.) So given her standing in our town, and given our town, we had to fashion a fitting funeral for her. The local papers reported her passing on their front pages, most national papers mentioned it, too. The internet lit up with an outpouring of love from generations of students who had studied in the school she founded, whose lives she had transformed, and from others who knew of the legendary legal battle she had waged and won for equal inheritance rights for Christian women in Kerala. The deluge of obituaries made it even more crucial that we do the right thing and send her on the way she deserved. But what was that right thing? Fortunately, on the day she died the school was closed and the children had gone home. The campus was ours. It was a huge relief. Perhaps she had planned that, too.",
      "Conversations about her death and its consequences for us, especially me, had begun when I was three years old. She was thirty then, debilitated by asthma, dead broke (her only asset was a bachelor's degree in education), and she had just walked out on her husband\u2014my father, I should say, although somehow that comes out sounding strange. She was almost eighty-nine when she died, so we had sixty years to discuss her imminent death and her latest will and testament, which, given her preoccupation with inheritance and wills, she rewrote almost every other week. The number of false alarms, close shaves, and great escapes that she racked up would have given Houdini pause for thought. They lulled us into a sort of catastrophe complacency. I truly believed she would outlive me. When she didn't, I was wrecked, heart-smashed. I am puzzled and more than a little ashamed by the intensity of my response.",

Behind him is a big screen that flashes pictures of Corbusier's B 306 chaise longue and Bauhaus nesting tables. I catch up on a lot of sleep in that class.",

    "summary": "Pop star Sabrina Carpenter spoke exclusively to \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King about her new album, \"Man's Best Friend,\" her songwriting process and more.",
    "story": [
      "Sabrina Carpenter dropped her seventh album, \"Man's Best Friend,\" on Friday \u2013 approximately one year after her Grammy Award winning album \"Short n' Sweet.\"",
      "\"I was just going through a lot and I was like, 'well, I could either, you know, sit and sulk about it, or I could write about it,' and it doesn't mean I have to put any of this out,\" Carpenter told \"CBS Mornings\" about creating the album.",
      "In an exclusive interview, the superstar spoke about her new music, songwriting process and the viral debate around her original album cover.",
      "For \"Man's Best Friend,\" Carpenter worked with familiar collaborators, including Jack Antonoff, John Ryan and Amy Allen.",
      "\"It felt like a band in a lot of ways. Like, someone's on the drums, and someone's over here playing the synth and then we're on the tambourine. \u2026 Then I'm cutting vocals. We're all doing gang vocals together,\" she said regarding the album.",
      "Carpenter described having \"many different processes\" while writing her songs \u2013 but highlighted lyrics and concepts come first.",
      "\"When I started, you know, becoming more sexual as a person, I think it's just something that's a part of life. You want to write about it,\" she said. \"I didn't realize it was as taboo of a topic until I started writing about it more freely.\"",
      "The Grammy Award winner gave insight into a few of the songs on the new album.",
      "For \"Never Getting Laid,\" she revealed, \"that one was a bit of a turning point for me because I'm so used to writing bitter songs and this one felt like being bitter but with a lot of sweetness.\"",
      "She said \"Don't Worry, I'll Make You Worry\" \"sounds like a threat, but it's, like, it's all just said with a wink. It's said with, like, a pat on the back. I think that is the way that I communicate.\"",
      "While fans speculate who her music is about, Carpenter maintained she wouldn't say.",
      "\"It's more fun for people to picture in their head than the person I picture in my head, I think,\" Carpenter said.",
      "\"I feel pretty transparent going into any of my relationships, that I write songs and I think they're just as down for it. I think it's also, most of the time, they've been pretty flattered when I \u2026 when they get a song written about them, good or bad.\"",
      "Carpenter admits that her music may not be for everyone, saying, \"you don't have to like what I do.\u00a0 I think there's this weird misconception that every artist has to check every box for everyone to like everything about them.\"",
      "She just hopes her fans she's speaking to through her music feel the connection and can relate.",
      "\"Then I'm happy,\" she said.",
      "The pop star has previously said she thinks of her life and music like a movie, saying \"there's like a lot of suspenseful music. There's some cliff hangers sometimes. It's truly an up-and-down.\"",
      "While describing her own life as versatile, she said she's currently, \"in a lovely place.\"",
      "Album cover debate",
      "Prior to the release of her new music, a debate ensued over Carpenter's original album cover for \"Man's Best Friend,\" shocking the singer.",
      "\"I think between me and my friends and my family and the people that I always share my music and my art with first, it was \u2026 it just wasn't even a conversation. It was just, like, it's perfect. For what the album is, it's perfect for, you know, kind of what it represents.\"",
      "The cover depicted Carpenter kneeling on the ground. An individual is standing next to her with Carpenter's hand on the person's thigh as they're pulling her hair.",
      "She said her intention was to keep the cover open to interpretation.",
      "\"My interpretation is being in on the control. Being in on your lack of control and when you want to be in control,\" Carpenter said. \"I think as a young woman, you're just as aware of when you're in control as when you're not.\"",
      "She explained the album for her was about \"the humanity of allowing yourself to make those mistakes.\"",
      "Carpenter said she tries to take the critical comments lightly.",
      "\"My fans that know me and know the person behind the music will look at that photo and they know exactly what it is. People that have no idea who I am absolutely look at that photo and go, like, 'where are her parents?'\"",
      "\"My parents actually saw the photo and they loved it,\" she said.",
      "Friendship with Taylor Swift",
      "Carpenter opened for Taylor Swift on the Eras tour.",
      "She's also featured on a song in Swift's upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" which will be released Oct. 3.",
      "While Carpenter wouldn't reveal anything about the song, she spoke about the opportunity, saying, \"I've been looking up to her (Swift) since I was, \u2026 I remember the first time I heard a song by her. I was 8 years old on the school bus, and I was \u2026 just like my life was changed.\"",
      "She also expressed her excitement for Swift following the announcement of her engagement to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, saying she wasn't surprised at how big the reaction was from fans.",
      "\"I'm just happy for them,\" Carpenter said.",

      "In his new book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life\" (published September 2 by Simon & Schuster), Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon and chief medical correspondent for CNN, writes about chronic pain, and the innovative techniques now being used to study and treat it.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Dr. Gupta on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" August 31!",
      "\"It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life\" by Dr. Sanjay Gupta",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Over a hundred years ago, William Osler, the Canadian physician and founding influence on modern medicine and medical education, is said to have instructed his students to \"listen to the patient. Quite often he is telling you the diagnosis.\"",
      "Today, the urgent search for meaningful insights into chronic pain has given that idea a new relevance, with impressive results. Health care providers now encourage patients to engage as partners in the treatment process. Research programs now routinely include people with lived experience\u2014patients, family members, caregivers\u2014as members of committees that advise and direct pain studies.",
      "Pain scientists are calling for a dramatic change that puts greater emphasis on the studies that draw first from people's real-life pain experience, then follows up with lab-based research to develop targeted solutions for effective pain management. This reverse translational research flips the classic bench-to-bedside process that starts in a laboratory and ends with a clinical trial.",
      "Reverse translational research begins with the patient's real-world experience and then tries to decipher the mechanisms through brain imaging and blood tests, correlated with the patient's symptoms and self-reports. Instead of the bench to the bedside, which was taught when I was in medical school, this is bedside to the bench research. The bench scientists then work with the findings to learn more about the basic mechanisms.",
      "Prasad Shirvalkar, a pain physician, neuroscientist, and the director of the Shirvalkar Lab at the University of California at San Francisco, used such a hybrid approach a couple of years ago to find the unicorn in pain science: objective biomarkers of a subjective experience. He started by implanting electrodes in the brains of patients, to measure brain signals. He then followed the trial participants home and, with the use of continuous surveys and digital monitoring, tracked their pain through everyday life and correlated those results with direct readings from the brain. The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

    "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 09:56:57 -0400",
    "summary": "Jane Pauley talks with the author of \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt\" about the body's defenses against pain; and with Ed Mowery, whose decades-long experience with pain led to a revolutionary surgery and treatment.",
    "story": [
      "Ed Mowery, the founder and lead singer of a death metal band, suffered unfathomable pain for decades: \"It was 24/7, 365,\" he said, likening it to \"lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and nerve pain in my arms.",
      "\"Have you ever had a really bad burn when you're cooking? Imagine that really bad burn, multiply it by, say, 20 to 30, and then apply it from the neck down. And on top of that burn was the lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and the crazy nerve burn in my arms. So, it was several different kinds of pain at once.\"",
      "It's a rare condition affecting 200,000 people in the U.S., called complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. But doctors could find no cause for it.",
      "\"There was nothing to point to and says, 'This is why it's hurting.' It was just a sort of unrelenting pain,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, best known as chief medical correspondent at CNN. A neurosurgeon and author, his latest book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt,\" explores the mystery of pain \u2013 mundane aches and pains, or excruciating pain like Mowery suffered.",
      "A lot of Americans are hurting; the CDC says approximately 20% are in pain. And while writing the book, Gupta found one of them was his mother \u2013 83-year-old Damyanti Gupta, who had a fall right outside her front door.",
      "\"I had osteoporosis,\" she said, \"and I think one of my bones must have given up, I think, because I didn't trip over anything.\"",
      "Imaging showed a compressed lumbar vertebra. But pain doesn't appear on X-rays and MRIs.\u00a0 \"You know how they ask you, doctors tell me, 'From a scale of one to 10, what is your pain?' I would've said 100,\" Damyanti said. \"You don't really realize 'til you have it. I never realized that pain can be that terrible. You don't want to even live anymore.\"",
      "\"I don't want to live anymore \u2013 coming from my mom, obviously it's really painful to hear,\" said Dr. Gupta. \"But also this was someone who'd never complained about anything. So, you had a sense of just how significant an impact this was on her.\"",
      "Spinal surgery successfully repaired the injured spine, and immediately Damyanti's pain went from 100 to about 3.",
      "The surprising source of pain",
      "As a brain surgeon, Gupta sees patients in pain every day, but he personally experienced serious pain when he was a kid who thought he could vault over a spiked fence. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he said. \"But I didn't make it. And this spike from the fence went right through the back of my skin on the side, and came right out the front. So, I was essentially pinned and impaled on top of this fence.\"",
      "As the shock wore off, the future doctor \u2013 still on the fence \u2013 took note: \"The pain started to come in waves. So it was there, felt like someone was sort of slapping my back, but then after a while it just didn't hurt that much anymore. And there was a couple of times when I had to reach back around and say, 'It's still there, right?' Even at the time, that struck me as a really surprising experience. Like, I had a hot poker thing going through my back, and yet I'm not feeling pain? Like, why would that be?\"",
      "Later, he learned the reason why. \"It took years to sort of understand this,\" he said. \"My body's endogenous opioid system \u2013 we have our own opioid system \u2013 it reacted, and it reacted in a big, big way. Because the body is just flooded with all these opioids and it improves my mood, it decreases my memory of the painful experience, and obviously it helps with the overall hurt.",
      "\"These are endorphins, and by the way, endorphins \u2013 endo, which means comes from your body, and phin, morphine\u2014so it's like your body's own natural morphine,\" he said.",
      "After years of suffering despite pain medication (including morphine), Ed Mowery joined a clinical trial at the University of California at San Francisco, which not only found the source of those \"lightning bolt razor snakes,\" but would make headlines around the world.",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "The source of the pain, said Gupta, was \"the brain. It's hard to conceptualize, I realize this. But Ed is sort of this daredevil guy. He had a lot of injuries over his life. He had had a knee operation, and it was after that knee operation that, for some reason, his brain had taken the experience of his knee surgery and started to memorize it, and got it a little bit wrong. So instead of saying, 'Hey, your knee hurts,' it just went into this hyper-drive. The best metaphor would be something known as 'phantom pain.' That's when someone loses a limb and then they still hurt, even though that limb doesn't even exist anymore. How can that happen? The brain. The brain is creating that pain. Why that's happening exactly, we're not sure.\"",
      "\"Shutting off\" the pain",
      "Mowery had volunteered for a study in deep brain stimulation and pain, and three rounds of brain surgery. \"I had nodes sticking out of my head,\" Mowery said. \"And I had 144 wires going to two computers. And I had a turban on my head. And I also had a lot more hair!\"",
      "Gupta said, \"After weeks they were able to draw this link between Ed's pain and these changes in the brain. And what they found with Ed was not only could they start to predict that Ed was gonna have pain, they could quantify how bad that pain was likely to be, and they could even interrupt the pain by giving a little stimulation. So even before the pain would get to conscious awareness, the stimulator would go off and it would start to interrupt that pain cycle.\"",
      "Gupta predicts Mowery's story is just the beginning: \"What these doctors were able to do, they were essentially able to put these probes all over the brain and just leave these probes in sort of to listen to Ed's brain.\"",
      "Even now, a computer can recognize his pain coming on \u2013 and shut it off.",
      "It's been life-changing for Mowery, who spoke about the clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health: \"The last two days of testing, the signal started working, and killing my pain,\" he said. \"I was beside myself.\"",
      "Though a small study, the implications for managing all sorts of pain are far-reaching. \u00a0As Gupta explains, the brain is the source of every sensation of pain, from a paper cut, to a broken vertebra, to \"razor snakes.\"",
      "I asked Mowery, \"Did you know when you signed up for this, what you were signing up for?\"",
      "\"It's funny you ask that question, because when I first found out, I said, 'There's no way. I'm not doing three brain surgeries. You're not going into my brain. No way,\" Mowery said. \"And then a year-and-a-half later, I was in so much pain, I just didn't care anymore.\"",
      "\"You seem very comfortable when you describe this as your brain,\" I said.",
      "\"It took me a while to wrap my brain around the fact that this is a brain disease,\" Mowery replied. \"It took a long time for me to just say, oh, you know, this is actually all in my head. But it wasn't imaginary. It was real.\"",
      "Today, Mowery is playing his music again, and looking forward to touring internationally with his band. \"I never lost hope,\" he said, \"because I knew something would come along to help me. And I think that's part of what got me through all this, was my attitude towards the whole thing.\"",

      "A new study released Friday found that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, are often prescribed medication too quickly.",
      "The study, led by Stanford Medicine and published in JAMA Network Open, examined the health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children ages 3 to 5 between 2016 and 2023 who were diagnosed with ADHD.",
      "\"ADHD is a disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or what we call hyperactivity, which is sort of like kids that have a hard time sitting still, they have a lot of energy,\" explained Jamie Howard, a senior clinical psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, which specializes in treating anxiety and mood disorders in children.",
      "Howard, who was not involved in the study, said that when treating ADHD in young children, clinical guidelines call for starting with \"behavioral intervention.\"",
      "\"We always want to start with the lowest possible harm,\" Howard said. \"It does very little harm doing a behavioral intervention.\"",
      "The Stanford study found that about 68% of those children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed medications before age 7, most often stimulants such as Ritalin, which can help children focus their attention and regulate their emotions.",
      "The turn to medication often came quickly, according to the study. About 42% of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis, the study found.",
      "\"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits,\" Dr. Yair Bannett, assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and the lead author of the study, said in a statement.",
      "Those side effects can include irritability, aggressiveness and emotional problems, according to Bannett.",
      "\"The high rate of medication prescriptions among preschool-age children with ADHD and the lack of delay between initial diagnosis and prescription require further investigation to assess the appropriateness of early medication treatment,\" the researchers concluded.",
      "The study also found that the vast majority of the young children diagnosed with ADHD, about 76%, were boys.",
      "\"I think that people have an association with ADHD and stimulant medication,\" Howard said. \"...But there is actually a lot more than that.

    "summary": "The Trump administration is trying to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, and several top CDC officials also resigned Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on the Department of Health and Human Services Thursday to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting next month amid a slew of departures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\"If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,\" Cassidy said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her ouster.",
      "Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things.",
      "The\u00a0agenda\u00a0for the Sept. 18 vaccine advisory committee meeting is set to include discussions of vaccines for COVID-19, Hepatitis B, RSV and the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and could entail scheduling votes on recommendations for these vaccines.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he wouldn't comment on personnel issues in an appearance on Fox News Thursday, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "In June, Kennedy said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the CDC's vaccine recommendations. Kennedy replaced the committee members with eight of his own picks.",
      "Cassidy's call to postpone the vaccine meeting is the second he's made under Kennedy's leadership \u2014 after he did the same in June\u00a0\u2014 and represents a break with the HHS secretary. In February, Kennedy's confirmation to the post came only after Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee. The Louisiana Republican, a medical doctor, had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed that he would speak with the secretary multiple times a month, and the pair \"would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship.\"",
      "In his statement Thursday, Cassidy said allegations have been made about the vaccine meeting \"agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed.\"",
      "\"These decisions directly impact children's health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted,\" the Louisiana senator said.",
      "Cassidy said in a post on X after news of the CDC departures Wednesday that the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "Ranking Member Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Cassidy Thursday calling for a bipartisan investigation into Monarez's firing. The Vermont senator also urged the chairman to hold a hearing with Kennedy, Monarez and the CDC leaders who stepped down.",
      "\"The American people should hear directly from Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Monarez and every member of our committee should be able to ask questions and get honest answers from them,\" Sanders said.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee announced a hearing next Thursday with Secretary Kennedy on President Trump's health care agenda. The proceeding was previously in the works prior to controversy, according to a committee aide, who noted the panel does not have jurisdiction over the CDC.",
      "A handful of congressional Democrats have called for Kennedy to resign or be fired over the mass exodus from the health agency.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-chrome-search-engine-data/",
    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 19:34:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The judge rejected the Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding the request was a bridge too far.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google's search engine in a crackdown aimed at curbing the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \"answer engines\" as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google's long-held position as the internet's main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by generative artificial intelligence, or \"GenAI,\" have reshaped the judge's approach to remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.",
      "\"Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge's forte,\" Mehta wrote.",
      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google's search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine's secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \"would be incredibly messy and highly risky.\"",
      "\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" Google said in a statement provided to CBS News following the ruling. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\"",
      "\"We proved in court that competition had been frozen in place for two decades in internet search,\" Abigail Slater, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, wrote in a social media post. \"Google's tactics have excluded competition, harming consumers and slowing innovation. Today's remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal.\"",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It's also something that Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and the beneficiaries of the payments urged Mehta to maintain.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google's search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",

      "Disney will pay $10 million to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that the entertainment company facilitated the \"unlawful collection\" of children's personal data.",
      "In a complaint filed on Tuesday, the FTC\u00a0said that Disney Worldwide Services and Disney Entertainment Operations \u2014 two entities that offer technical support and media content \u2014 violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, known as COPPA, by failing to properly label some videos uploaded to YouTube as \"made for kids.\" The mislabeling also exposed children to \"age-inappropriate YouTube features,\" the FTC said in a\u00a0statement.",

    "summary": "A digital token offered by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial has started trading. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "A new cryptocurrency issued by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial\u00a0and that started trading this week has boosted the family's wealth on paper by roughly $5 billion despite the digital token sinking in its first two days of being listed on the exchange.",
      "The crypto, called WLFI, reached a high of about 40 cents after launching on Monday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. By Tuesday morning, the value of the token had fallen to as low as about 21 cents, down 48% from its peak, before recovering to about 23 cents in the afternoon.",
      "Even with the decline, the Trump family's stake in WLFI is worth about $5 billion based on its holdings of 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. Mr. Trump and his family aren't yet able to sell their holdings as its founders' tokens remained locked, according to World Liberty Financial.",
      "World Liberty Financial didn't immediately return a request for comment. Here's what to know about the company's token.",
      "Trump's support for crypto",
      "Once an avowed skeptic of cryptocurrency, Mr. Trump has championed the digital asset in his second term, vowing to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial and the Trump family's other private crypto ventures have raised concerns among some watchdog groups and Democratic lawmakers over potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\"The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "In July, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies, into law. The act established federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The surging value of World Liberty Financial, whose co-founders include Mr. Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, underscores the president's growing interest in cryptocurrency, a focus that spans both personal investments and policy moves during his presidency. Those efforts include\u00a0$TRUMP and $Melania meme coins, which are cryptos whose value is linked to internet trends and which began trading in January.",
      "What is WLFI?",
      "WLFI is a token, or a digital asset, that guarantees its holders the right to vote on governance issues for World Liberty Financial, according to the company.",
      "World Liberty Financial cautions token owners that WLFI isn't an investment, with its terms stating: \"You should not acquire $WLFI as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, for a financial purpose or with an expectation of resale for a profit or otherwise.\"",
      "The early swing in WLFI's price isn't unusual for tokens making their market debut, said Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, a provider of crypto and blockchain information.",
      "\"The price action from 40 cents to 21 cents is typical for new token launches,\" Puckrin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Early hype usually drives initial spikes, followed by a wave of selling as early entrants take profits.\"",
      "He added, \"Compared to other major token debuts, WLFI's decline is relatively moderate, and early backers have still seen strong returns from private sales.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial also offers a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Because stablecoins are linked to fixed assets, they are generally seen as less volatile to other cryptos.",
      "\"WLFI is carving out a unique position by offering token holders real governance rights over the direction of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin that is growing rapidly,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That's important because WLFI holders, through their governance votes, can help influence the future development and policies of USD1 and World Liberty Financial's policies, he added. That capacity \"sets it apart in a crowded market,\" he said.",
      "What about insider concentration risk?",
      "The Trump family and other insiders own more than 20% of the WLFI tokens, according to World Liberty Financial's site.",
      "But World Liberty Financial's terms note that no single digital wallet can exercise more than 5% of governance power, which should deter outsized insider influence, Puckrin said.",
      "What's happening with Mr. Trump's other crypto ventures?",
      "In May, the $TRUMP meme coin drew scrutiny when the venture offered its top holders the chance to join Mr. Trump for dinner. Investors spent about $140 million to snap up the coins and secure an invite to the event, data showed at the time.",
      "That sparked concerns from government watchdogs and some Democratic lawmakers that the Trump-branded asset was being linked to gain access to the president.",
      "As investors snapped up the meme coin, the asset's value almost doubled to about $15 in May. Since then, the coin has given up most of the gains and was trading at about $8.30 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 the owner of the Truth Social app \u2014 has expanded into crypto in recent months. In July, it bought about $2 billion in cryptocurrencies\u00a0to refashion the business as an investment firm.",

      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said. Frontier is expanding the pass as low-cost competitor Spirit struggles with its second bankruptcy in less than a year, while rival Southwest's new policies, like ending its\u00a0free checked bag policy, have alienated some customers.",
      "\"They see all other budget airlines really struggling, and there is market share for travelers who are in the market for budget airline flights,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They smell opportunity, and Frontier has always been good at expanding.\"",
      "What do passholders get?",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 08:22:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Courts weigh fairness of reimbursement formula as Arkansas jury finds against State Farm.",
    "story": [
      "An Arkansas jury found recently that a major car insurance carrier had shortchanged customers who had been in accidents that left their cars \"totaled,\" and now plaintiffs in other states are pursuing similar cases.",
      "The Arkansas lead plaintiff, Rose Chadwick, said she initially assumed the reimbursement for her \"totaled\" 2011 Hyundai was reasonable compensation, \"because that's what I pay them for, is to be fair with me.\"",
      "But after learning about potential legal action challenging the way insurance carrier State Farm calculated the replacement cost, she decided to bring her case to court. Her lawyers alleged that the company used technology to estimate the amount of buying a replacement. That program factored into the calculation the potential for the car buyer to negotiate a discount from used car dealers \u2014 a haggling discount that Chadwick's attorneys argued was no longer consistent with how modern-day used cars are priced and sold.",
      "\"The computer program that State Farm used to calculate the replacement value of the car, did it systematically unfairly,\" said Chadwick's attorney, Brian Glasser. Glasser says his firm argued that commonly used software systematically low-balled the value of total-loss cars for tens of thousands of drivers across the country.",
      "In an Arkansas federal court in June, a jury agreed \u2014 finding in favor of Chadwick and 37,000 other plaintiffs. The jury determined Chadwick had been underpaid by about $600 for a car worth $4,700.",
      "State Farm is fighting lawsuits on the issue in multiple states, arguing that the system the company used at the time was standard for most automobile insurers. It no longer uses the same program to calculate reimbursement amounts.",
      "\"State Farm always seeks to pay what we owe within the terms of the policy to help our customers recover from a loss,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We work with the policyholder to determine the actual cash value of a total loss vehicle considering the age, condition, equipment, mileage of the vehicle at the time of the loss,\" the company said, adding that customers are \"also invited to share additional information and has the option to use a third-party appraisal to help reach agreement on the value of their totaled vehicle.\"",
      "A \"totaled\" car is typically one that has sustained damage that would cost more to repair than the value of the car itself.",
      "Company officials noted that appellate courts in multiple jurisdictions have agreed with their contention that a challenge to the reimbursement process cannot be made en masse, in the form of a class action lawsuit, as it was in Arkansas. The courts have split over whether each reimbursement case is unique, and must be filed separately, or whether all customers whose loss was calculated the same way can file suit together as a class.",
      "Chadwick's case began five years ago, when her daughter borrowed her car for an early morning run to the store when she was struck from behind while going through an intersection.",
      "After learning of the reimbursement issue in a social media post, Chadwick became the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the insurance giant accusing it of undervaluing and shorting payouts on claims like hers.",
      "\"State Farm moves billions of dollars to people for their broken cars every year and, and insurance companies around America do similar numbers,\" Glasser said. \"So we're talking about these computer programs that calculate the value of your replacement vehicle that affect billions of dollars every year.\"",
      "Attorneys are launching similar cases against several insurance carriers in at least 19 states while regulators in some of those states weigh whether insurers must change how they value total loss cars.",
      "State Farm said customers are not without recourse if they have questions about the estimate the company provides to reimburse a customer whose car was a total loss. Among them, customers are encouraged to ask their insurer how they determined the payout amount, to an agreeable price, and to get an independent appraisal of what the car was worth.",
      "In the end, Chadwick said the dispute was less about the money than about principles.",
      "\"It was like hiding something and you shouldn't hide,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Kraft Heinz is splitting into two companies a decade after they joined in a massive merger that created one of the biggest food conglomerates on the planet.",
      "One of the companies, currently called Global Taste Elevation Co., will include shelf-stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, Kraft Heinz said Tuesday. The other, currently called North American Grocery Co.,  will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The names of the two companies will be released later.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split.",
      "The company's board \"unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent, publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off,\" Kraft Heinz said.",
      "In 2015, when they merged, the company wanted to capitalize on its massive scale, but shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table. Kraft Heinz and other food producers have shifted offerings to follow that trend.",
      "\"Kraft Heinz's brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\" Kraft Heinz Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz CEO  Carlos Abrams-Rivera said, \"This move will unleash the power of our brands and unlock the potential of our business. This next step in our transformation is only possible because of the commitment of our 36,000 talented employees who deliver quality and value for consumers every day. We will continue to operate as 'one Kraft Heinz' throughout the separation process.\"",
      "The path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.",
      "3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It's known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.",
      "The deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz's new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.",
      "At the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.",
      "In 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.",
      "But the combined company struggled, despite layoffs of thousands of employees and other cost-cutting measures. Even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid.",
      "Kraft Heinz also had trouble distinguishing its products from cheaper store brands. At Walmart, a 14-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup costs $2.98; the same size bottle of Walmart's Great Value brand is 98 cents.",
      "In 2019, Kraft Heinz slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion, citing operational costs and supply chain problems. But many investors blamed the company's leadership, saying its zeal for cost-cutting was hurting brand innovation.",
      "In 2021, Kraft Heinz sold both its Planters nut business and its natural cheese business, vowing to reinvest the money into higher-growth brands like P3 protein snacks and Lunchables.",
      "But the company's net revenue has fallen every year since 2020, when it saw a pandemic-related bump in sales. In April, Kraft Heinz lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker customer spending in the U.S. and the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Carlos Abrams-Rivera will continue to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and will become CEO of North American Grocery Co. once the separation is complete. Kraft Heinz said its board is working with an executive search firm to identify potential CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.",
      "Kraft Heinz says it has no plans to change its current headquarter locations in Chicago and Pittsburgh. It currently expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2026.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Sep 2025 14:29:10 -0400",
    "summary": "The number of immigrant workers has declined from January through the end of July, preliminary Census data shows.",
    "story": [
      "As millions of Americans gather Monday to celebrate Labor Day, federal data shows how President Trump's immigration policies are reshaping the U.S. workforce.",
      "The number of immigrant workers in the U.S. has declined by 1.2 million from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data, analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That figure includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "The labor market shakeup comes as the flow of immigrants into the U.S. has slowed significantly under Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on \"dangerous criminals,\" but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.",
      "The overall number of people in the U.S. illegally peaked at an estimated 14 million in 2023, according to a Pew Research Center\u00a0estimate. However, the number of unauthorized immigrants has likely declined since then \"due in part to increased deportations and reduced protections under the Trump administration,\" the authors of the Pew Research Center report said.",
      "In an Aug. 28 report, Oxford Economics projects the slowdown will persist through Mr. Trump's presidency, with net immigration falling to an annualized 500,000 by year-end and holding at that level until 2028.",
      "Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce, and data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.",
      "\"It's unclear how much of the decline we've seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,\" Kramer said. \"However, we don't believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn't real.\"",
      "To be sure, the loss of immigrant workers reflects a small share of the overall U.S. labor force of more than 171 million workers. But the decline could affect states and sectors that are more dependent on foreign workers, economists say.",
      "Potential implications for the labor market",
      "Immigrants play a key role in alleviating labor shortages, as the majority tend to be ages 25 to 54, Oxford Economics noted. Economists call that demographic \"prime working age\" because they tend to be in their most productive decades of work.",
      "Immigrants are also more willing to migrate to states with higher labor demand.",
      "\"This is critical to ease shortages in regional labor markets, especially as U.S. labor mobility has steadily declined since the 1980s,\" Oxford Economics researchers noted.",
      "However, states with large shares of undocumented residents \u2014 namely Louisiana, Florida and New York \u2014 are starting to see some of the biggest declines in unauthorized migration, the report says.",
      "Experts say the drop in workforce participation could ripple through the labor market, which is already under some strain as employers pull back on hiring. The average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from an average of 123,000 from for the first four months of the year.",
      "\"The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that's where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,\" said Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \"That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.\"",
      "Immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S., according to Orrenius.",
      "The plunge in unauthorized immigration may also give the impression that the labor force is tighter than it actually is due to the higher ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, Oxford Economics said. That could muddy the picture of what's going on in the labor market, the authors say.",
      "\"The Fed is highly sensitive to the downside risks to the labor market, but the immigration reversal will continue to complicate the signals from the labor market data,\" they write.",
      "ICE raids take a toll on farms",
      "Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won't be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.",
      "Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.",
      "\"In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,\" she said.",
      "In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).",
      "Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.",
      "Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.",
      "\"People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,\" Tate said.",
      "Lidia, a farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.",
      "\"I don't know if I'll be able to bring my kids,\" said Lidia. \"I'm also very concerned I'd have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.\"",
      "Construction sites in and around McAllen also \"are completely dead,\" Rodriguez said.",
      "\"We have a large labor force that is undocumented,\" she said. \"We've seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.\"",
      "Construction jobs",
      "The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.",
      "\"Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,\" said Ken Simonson, the association's chief economist. \"But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn't disrupting labor supplies.\"",
      "This may just be the tip of the iceberg: The Oxford report authors say that the increase in funding for immigration enforcement from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could eventually lead to an \"even higher sustained rate of deportations.\"",
      "Kramer, with Pew, warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.",
      "The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.",
      "\"What's going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?\" De La Cruz said. \"What happens when immigrants aren't in the field to pick our crops? Who's going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?\"",

      "Now a federal appeals court has thrown a roadblock in his path.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that Mr. Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify tariffs on nearly every country on Earth. The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York.",
      "But Friday's 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, giving his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling represents a major setback for Mr. Trump, who has said his trade policies will enrich the U.S. by bringing back manufacturing jobs and contributing billions in new revenue for the federal government.",
      "\"This ruling highlights a serious legal threat to one of the president's most high-profile economic policies,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory company deVere Group, in an emailed report.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a\u00a0Truth Social post, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "Six of the seven judges who ruled against the tariffs are appointees of Democratic presidents, while the seventh is an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush. Of the four judges who dissented, two were appointed by former President Obama and two by former President George W. Bush.",
      "Here's what could happen next as the legal case proceeds.",
      "How did the dispute arise?",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a months-long legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses, which are arguing that the president has exceeded his authority in issuing the import duties.",
      "The appeals court's decision is focused on the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in April on most trading partners, along with earlier levies on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 \u2014 or Liberation Day, he called it \u2014 imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.",
      "The president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. \u2014 and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did \u2014 including the U.K., Japan and the EU \u2014 and agreed to deals with Mr. Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.",
      "Countries that didn't comply faced higher tariffs earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Mr. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.",
      "What is the IEEPA?",
      "Mr. Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, by declaring longstanding U.S. trade deficits \"a national emergency.\"",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that illegal immigration and drug trafficking amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Mr. Trump has made the most of it.",
      "Does the ruling apply to all tariffs?",
      "No, the court's ruling doesn't cover all of Mr. Trump tariffs. For instance, his levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos were imposed under a different regulation after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.",
      "Nor does it include tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.",
      "In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs \"exceed any authority granted to the President'' under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that \"it seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.\"",
      "What happens next?",
      "The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote on his social media platform on Friday.",
      "A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Mr. Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \"is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,\" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.",
      "The government has argued that if Mr. Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.",
      "Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, such as American manufacturers or retailers that rely on foreign-made products. While the U.S. companies typically swallow some of the cost, they pass on much of the added expenses to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "The Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the U.S.",
      "It could also put Mr. Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.",
      "\"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.",
      "Does the Trump administration have other options?",
      "Mr. Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.",
      "For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Mr. Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits.",
      "The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and automobiles. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot be imposed at the president's sole discretion.",
      "\"Even if the tariffs are struck down, we believe the Trump administration will look for new ways to tax imports or otherwise raise revenue from companies selling into the U.S.,\" noted Green of the deVere Group.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT use AI to do thinking or writing or creating for you. Pretty amazing, but also a little terrifying. What happens to the people who used to do those jobs?",
      "Olivia Fair graduated four years ago. \"I've applied to probably over a hundred jobs in the past, I don't know, six months,\" she said. \"And yeah, none of them are landing.\"",
      "She's had a series of short-term jobs - one was in TV production, transcribing interviews. \"But now they don't have a bunch of people transcribing,\" she said. \"They have maybe one person overseeing all of that, and AI doing the rest. Which I think is true for a lot of entry-level positions. And it can be a very useful tool for those people doing that work. But then there's less people needed.\"",
      "According to Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at Indeed, the job-listings website, job postings have declined year over year by 6.7 percent. \"This is a tough year,\" she said. \"Younger job seekers, specifically those who are recent grads, are having a harder time finding work.\"",
      "Asked if there is a correlation between the rise in AI and the decline in jobs for recent graduates, Ullrich said, \"I think there is a cause-and-effect, but it's maybe not as significant as a lot of people would think. If you look specifically at tech jobs, job postings are down 36% compared to pre-pandemic numbers. But that decline started happening prior to AI becoming commonly used.\"",
      "Ullrich said in 2021-22, as the effects of the COVID pandemic began to ebb, there was a hiring boom in some sectors, including tech: \"Quite frankly, I think some companies overhired,\" she said.",
      "The uncertain national situation (tariffs, taxes, foreign policy) doesn't help, either. Ullrich said, \"Some other people have used the analogy of, like, driving through fog. If it's foggy, you slow down a bit. But if it's really foggy, you pull over. And unfortunately, some companies have pulled over to sit and wait to see what is gonna happen.\"",

You know, how do I care for this patient, or land this plane, or remodel this building? And it's possible that we could strip out so much of the supporting work, that people never get the expertise. I don't think it's an insurmountable concern. But we shouldn't take for granted that it will solve itself.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 30 Aug 2025 09:26:09 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal appeals court said many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, but didn't halt them.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.",
      "The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",
      "The court's\u00a0ruling\u00a0will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

      "The tourism agency is also pushing budget tips and free activities citywide.",
      "\"The idea that generally Las Vegas is not a value, that it is overpriced, I don't think our customers are doing math when they are concerned about a specific issue,\" Hill said. \"They're expressing concern about that specific topic, that tends to then move into a narrative around Las Vegas is expensive or Las Vegas is not a value, but if you actually do the math on that, that's not accurate.\"",
      "International travel remains mixed.",
      "Traffic from Canada is down about 18%, which Hill attributed in part to friction caused by politics and tariffs. By contrast, visits from Mexico, the United Kingdom and Australia are rising, with more flights into Las Vegas.",
      "He also criticized a $250 U.S. visa fee for travelers from non-waiver countries, costs that can top $1,000 for a family of four, and long processing times that he said suppress demand.",
      "Despite the downward trend in overall visitors, Nevada gaming revenue remains resilient, a sign that visitors who do come are still spending.",
      "Nevada casinos kept $1.36 billion from gamblers in July, up 4% from a year earlier, according to data from state regulators.",
      "The Las Vegas Strip drove the increase with $749 million, a 5.6% gain. Downtown Las Vegas rose 3.6%.",

Closing this loophole strengthens our nation's supply chain integrity, improves consumer protection, and levels the playing field for all retailers.\"",
      "Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said on a call with reporters on Thursday that ending the exemption would generate up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues, while also creating thousands of jobs.",
      "How much pricier?",
      "According to a recent FlavorCloud\u00a0analysis, a pair of lined slippers made in China and shipped to the U.S. that previously cost $30 when the de minimis exemption was in force will now cost $44.37, an increase of 51%. That figure factors in several U.S.tariffs on imports: a 12.5% levy on slippers; 20% duty on Chinese goods; and a 10% universal tariff on all imports, as well as a $2.62 merchandise processing fee to calculate the new price.",
      "A nutritional supplement from Canada that formerly cost $37 will now run $60.17 with tariffs in effect, FlavorCloud also found. And a stainless steel water bottle from the U.K. that cost $15 when ordered online in the U.S. will see its price rise to $21.81 once tariffs are applied.",
      "Additionally, a chef's knife from Japan that previously sold for $240 online could cost $298.49 after accounting for applicable tariffs, according to the same analysis.",
      "To be sure, some foreign manufacturers could choose to absorb the cost of higher U.S. tariffs \u2014 which are typically paid by importers here at home \u2014 experts said.",
      "\"Because consumers want bargains, many companies may choose to bite the bullet and incur the increased import costs if they could remain competitive,\" said Augustine Lo, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, while noting that abolishing the de minimis loophole amounts to a heavy burden on small and midsize businesses.",
      "Indeed, for now tariffs have had relatively little impact on the rate of U.S. inflation, economic data shows, although forecasters note that it can take up to a year for levies to trickle into consumer prices.",
      "Avoiding surprise costs",
      "Shoppers can take certain steps to avoid being hit with surprise costs when ordering goods online from overseas.",
      "First, check a product's country of origin before making a purchase. U.S.-based sellers often ship goods from their warehouses abroad, which could greatly increase the cost of an item now that tariffs are being applied. More specifically, look for tariff surcharges listed as line items on companies' websites, and decide if the extra charges are worth the cost.",
      "For example, if the imports duties on a particular good exceed its value, it may not be worth buying. At minimum, factor in such added costs into your budget while shopping, FlavorCloud recommends.",
      "The bottom line is that the end of the de minimis loophole amounts to a major shift for consumers and businesses alike, according to Sean Henry, CEO and co-founder of Stord, an e-commerce fulfillment platform.",
      "\"It's a large change because over the last decade, de minimis has accounted for such a large portion of online sales,\" Henry told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol processed $65 billion worth of de minimis packages.",
      "\"It was a way to allow international sellers a fast path, with no paperwork or customs duties, into the U.S.,\" Henry said. \"It's like they were in the fast line at the airport and ran right through. Now, all of a sudden, those same packages are being put into general boarding, and it's going to slow everything down.\"",

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines again filed for bankruptcy protection from its debts only months after emerging from Chapter 11.",
    "story": [
      "Budget carrier Spirit Airlines said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection only months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization.",
      "The no-frills airline said it intends to conduct business as normal during the restructuring process, meaning passengers can continue to book trips and use their tickets, credits and loyalty points. The company said its employees and contractors would still be paid.",
      "Spirit CEO Dave Davis said the airline's previous Chapter 11 petition\u00a0focused on reducing debt and raising capital, and since exiting that process in March \"it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future.\"",
      "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \"adverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.",
      "That included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "Troubles since the pandemic",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines \u2014 many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings \u2014 Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Spirit operates 5,013 flights to 88 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama and Colombia, according to travel search engine Skyscanner.net",

    "summary": "Persistent inflation remains a pain point for consumers \u2014 and for the Federal Reserve as it weighs whether to lower interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation continued to run hot in July, underlining the Federal Reserve's dilemma as it looks to lower prices for American consumers while propping up a job market that is starting to wobble.",
      "Prices across the U.S. rose at an annual rate of 2.6% last month, according to personal consumption expenditures data released on Friday. That's the same figure as in June, a sign inflation remains persistent. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, inflation in July actually ticked up to 2.9% from a year ago, up from 2.8% in June.",
      "Read on for a breakdown of Friday's PCE report.",
      "How are consumers faring?",
      "The latest PCE data shows that consumer spending rose 0.5% in July, suggesting that Americans are continuing to open their wallets even in the face of economic uncertainty.",
      "But while people continue to spend, many consumers are increasingly having to make trade-offs on what they spend their money on, Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Consumers are trying to push through \u2014 they're doing the best they can, but they're increasingly under pressure, and therefore they're being more cautious with discretionary outlets,\" he said. \"They travel less. They spend less on restaurants, spend more cautiously on transportation.\"",
      "Such caution can augur a deeper slump given that consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity. The closely watched University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, released Friday, showed that Americans are increasingly concerned about inflation.",
      "Although inflation has cooled significantly since peaking in 2022, it remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% annual target. And consumers continue to feel the pain in the form of higher prices for some groceries as well as rising electricity costs. Another key inflation gauge \u2014 the\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0\u2014 shows that the price of coffee was up 14.8% from a year ago, while beef and egg costs were 15.5% and 16.4%, respectively.",
      "Are tariffs impacting inflation?",
      "Not yet. In a positive sign, the price of goods, which are most susceptible to tariffs than services, cooled slightly in July, the PCE data shows, decreasing 0.1% from the month prior. That suggests tariffs have had a minimal impact on prices so far.",
      "\"It's not showing up in a goods prices, in the government statistics at least,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, analysts say inflation could bare its teeth more in the coming months as U.S. tariffs start to trickle through the economy.",
      "\"We continue to expect tariffs to take a growing bite out of growth in real income and real consumer spending,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report.",
      "A critical question facing the economy is whether any tariff-induced inflation amounts to a one-time boost to prices or results in a more prolonged increase. Fed Chair Jerome Powell laid out the scenarios in a\u00a0speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, earlier this month, noting that even if inflation does end up being a \"one-time\" scenario, it will still \"take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks.\"",
      "What does the latest inflation data mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "Most Wall Street analysts think the latest inflation figures keep the Fed on track to lower interest rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting.",
      "\"Today's numbers on both the personal consumption, expenditure, and income and spending, were right down the middle of the fairway,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist for B. Riley Wealth. \"This leaves the door wide open for the Fed to cut rates in September, and likely again in October and in December.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-trump-attempt-remove-lisa-cook-federal-governor/",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:28:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced earlier this week that he would be removing Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",
      "Roth said \"cause\" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.",
      "Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.",
      "Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.",
      "The Supreme Court called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",

      "The figures illustrate why many Fed officials\u00a0have been wary\u00a0about cutting their benchmark interest rate. While inflation is much lower than the roughly 7% peak it reached three years ago, it remains above the central bank's 2% target.",

Spending jumped sharply for long-lasting goods such as cars, appliances and furniture, many of which are imported.",
      "Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note that the rise in the core inflation measure was due to a rise in core services, which rose 0.3% on a monthly basis. That suggests tariffs are having a \"minimal impact on goods prices,\" he wrote.",

      "The president \"ending of the deadly de minimum loophole will save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics and other dangerous prohibited items, and add up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues to our Treasury,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters Thursday, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "But there will still be a six-month transition period when postal service shippers can choose to pay a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package depending on the country of origin, Reuters said, citing Trump administration officials.",
      "Mr. Trump ended the de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong in May. It had allowed retailers such as Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to U.S.-based consumers at bargain-basement prices. Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S., according to the White House.",
      "The exemption's end now applies to all nations.",
      "The de minimis provision was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after the law passed. It was intended to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",
      "The number of low-value parcels entering the U.S. has surged over the past decade. Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to nearly 1.4 billion. Customs and Border Patrol was processing more than 4 million de minimis shipments to the U.S. daily, the White House said.",
      "Retailers such as Shein and Temu were forced to scramble when the loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong was suspended China-based Temu halted shipments of Chinese goods to American customers and shifted to only selling products to U.S. shoppers that could be sourced from the company's U.S. warehouses.",

    "summary": "Critics caution U.S. government equity stakes in American companies could lead to cronyism, distorted economics and bad deals for taxpayers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's 10% stake in Intel, announced not long after President Trump had called on the chip maker's CEO to resign, is being criticized by conservatives and some economic policy experts alike, who worry such extensive government intervention undermines free enterprise.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, may have fueled those misgivings, telling CNBC this week that although Intel is a \"very, very special\" circumstance, that \"there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry, then other industries.\" The possibility of the U.S. acquiring stakes in additional U.S. companies was immediately met with criticism.",
      "Adam Posen, president of the Petersen Foundation for International Economics, responded immediately to Hassett's comment, posting on X, \"ARE you effing kidding me? We are going past 1984 into Animal Farm territory at this point,\" referring to the George Orwell satirical novel critiquing totalitarianism. \"Did anyone vote for this? Anyone?\"",
      "Daniel Di Martino, a fellow at the right-of-center Manhattan Institute, predicted that if that happens, the U.S. would see more cronyism, with the result that \"companies will underperform because they know they will be bailed out,\" and \"taxpayers will lose billions.\"",
      "\"You can't just be against socialism when the left does it,\" conservative talk show host Erick Erikson said of the Intel agreement. \"If you're not against socialism overall, guess what? You're going to get socialism. So if you support socialism, apparently Donald Trump is your guy.\"",
      "Why did the U.S. invest in Intel?",
      "Mr. Trump says he'd like to increase chip production in the U.S. and reduce the nation's dependence on chips manufactured overseas. He believes that the investment in Intel will help the U.S. to better position itself to maintain its technological edge over China in the artificial intelligence race. But the U.S. had already invested in Intel through the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, and Mr. Trump and his top administration officials said the U.S. government is owed a return on their investment.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said the U.S. is taking a stake \"to ensure that the United States government is making our country wealthy again and is benefitting from some of these deals.\"",
      "\"We should get an equity stake for our money,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. \"So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it.\"",
      "But Intel has been struggling \u2014 not just for a couple of years, but for decades, said Scott Lincicome, a leading economic and trade policy expert who is a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute and has criticized the Intel deal.",
      "Intel prospered in the 1990s and early 2000s, when most personal computers relied on the company's processors. The emergence of competitors like AMD and Intel's own failure to adapt to mobile computing after the 2007 advent of the iPhone clobbered the chipmaker.",
      "And now, as Nvidia and AMD vie for dominance in the AI chip race, Intel has been lagging.",
      "\"Even if you think government should be investing in companies, Intel is not a lean, mean, innovating machine,\" Lincicome said.",
      "The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting company plans to reduce its workforce by 25% by the end of the year. The company said the administration made the $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock because of the government's confidence in the role Intel plays in \"expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "The Biden administration originally said Intel had to meet certain benchmarks to get the taxpayer money, but Mr. Trump removed those goals to buy the stake in Intel.",
      "Peril in partial government ownership",
      "Economic policy experts fear the U.S. stake in Intel will throw open the door to political pressure and cronyism.",
      "Intel warned in a federal filing this week that there \"could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors.\"",
      "Lincicome maintains that Intel was able to obtain a government infusion of cash not on the strength of its operations, but rather because it has the best lobbyists. And this will just lead more companies to vie for investment in the same way, he said.",
      "\"This is one of the problems with government picking winners and losers in industrial policy in general,\" Lincicome said.",
      "He outlined his concerns in an op-ed for the Washington Post this week.",
      "\"With the U.S. government as its largest shareholder, Intel will face constant pressure to align corporate decisions with the goals of whatever political party is in power,\" Lincicome wrote. \"Will Intel locate or continue facilities \u2014 such as its long-delayed 'megafab' in Ohio \u2014 based on economic efficiency or government priorities? Will it hire and fire based on merit or political connections?\"",
      "Lincicome isn't the only analyst who pointed out that the uncomfortable decisions CEOs make could come into conflict with U.S. prerogatives if the country holds a stake in their\u00a0 companies.",
      "\"There are major risks to these companies,\" said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, while acknowledging it isn't yet clear what the Trump administration is planning for any future investments. \"A lot of the things that companies need to do in order to stay competitive in the market are politically unpopular,\" like layoffs. \"It's going to be a lot harder for these companies to engage in those painful but necessary moves if the president feels like they would create a political vulnerability for him.\"",
      "Companies without U.S. investment will feel pressure, too, said Di Martino. A company that needs semiconductor chips may decide to buy from Intel because it doesn't want to lose government contracts.",
      "The Trump administration has shown a willingness to use industrial policy in other ways that depart from free market economic principles long favored by conservatives and corporate America. Most notably, Mr. Trump's aggressive \u2014 and sometimes punitive \u2014 use of tariffs, which he has said will reduce the country's trade deficit, revive American manufacturing and generate federal revenue, hearkens back to the mercantilism of centuries past and contrasts with the laissez-faire ideas that have shaped the American economy.",
      "How is the U.S. paying for the Intel stake?",
      "Much of the cash for the stake is coming from the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, which is intended to boost America's competitiveness in the chip industry.",
      "Intel has already received $2.2 billion from the CHIPS Act, and is on track to receive another $5.7 billion injection from the law. A different federal program gave Intel $3.2 billion, for a grand total of $11.1 billion, according to a release from Intel. Intel and the federal government say the ownership will be passive, and have not said how long the U.S. intends to hold onto its stake, although there is a provision for the government to expand its stake further.",
      "How Intel plans to use the U.S. investment",
      "The chip maker says it's planning to use the money to expand its chip-making capacity by modernizing and increasing the size of U.S. sites in Arizona and elsewhere.",
      "Hassett has defended the U.S. stake, referring to the process of partial ownership of Intel as \"very, very special circumstances\" because of the funding made available by the CHIPS Act. When he was asked about the U.S. bar for acquiring equity stakes in companies, Hassett told CNBC, \"If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people.\"",
      "Strain said a government stake in U.S. companies also poses a big risk for taxpayers, too.",
      "\"This is also going to accrue to the detriment of the American people, because you're going to see a lot of good taxpayer money chasing bad investments because the government's not going to extricate itself quickly or easily from these arrangements, and more generally, countries that have gone down this route have had slower productivity growth, slower increases in living standards, and companies that are less likely to be industry leaders,\" Strain said.",
      "Past U.S. stakes in big banks and automakers",
      "One reason economists are uncomfortable with the government's stake in Intel stems from the message it may send about the U.S. economy. The most prominent modern example of a similar U.S. investment took place during the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. sunk $700 billion into a big bank bailout and over $17 billion into two of the big three U.S. automakers. It did so because the banks were considered \"too big to fail\" and the potential collapse of the auto companies could cost millions of jobs.",
      "Experts now are raising questions about the wisdom of buying a stake in a company when the economy isn't in crisis.",
      "Lincicome said the administration is sending a contradictory message by highlighting the struggles China is having with its economy while at the same time saying \"we want to be more like China\" by having the federal government more involved in U.S. companies.",
      "\"There is no crisis, there's certainly no war, so this is a big break from what we've done before,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Although economists and politicians differ on the success of the General Motors and Chrysler bailouts, Lincicome said there was undoubtedly a crisis. The federal government took ownership stakes in the two automakers to stabilize them but within a few years had sold the stakes, after the companies were on firmer financial footing.",
      "Not socialism, but maybe a step in that direction?",
      "While partial ownership of Intel or other companies isn't exactly socialism, Di Martino said it \"absolutely\" blurs the lines between the private sector and the public sector.",
      "\"Socialism and free enterprise are not a switch, they are a continuum,\" Di Martino said, adding partial ownership of U.S. companies would be \"definitely a step toward socialism, there is no doubt about that.\"",
      "Di Martino said the U.S. ownership stake in Intel \"certainly gets us closer [to socialism] and makes us less prosperous.\"",
      "\"I think the right way to describe it is a move toward state capitalism,\" Strain said. \"I don't think I would describe it as socialism.\"",
      "Lutnick put it this way: \"Intel agreed to give us 10% of their company, which, of course, was worth $11 billion.\"",
      "\"So, it's not socialism,\" he said at a Trump Cabinet meeting Tuesday. \"This is capitalism.\"",
      "Di Martino is dubious about whether that's true. \"We are intervening in the capital markets in a way that is going to lead to inefficiencies,\" he said, adding, \"And it's going to shift capital away from other companies.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled against President Trump's use of an 18th century wartime law to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, finding \"no invasion or predatory incursion.\"",
      "The Trump administration deported hundreds of accused Tren de Aragua gang members earlier this year using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, an obscure law that allows the president to remove citizens of an enemy country during an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" Some of those migrants were later flown to a supermax prison in El Salvador \u2014 though many of the detainees were sent to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap in July.",
      "The strategy has drawn a litany of court challenges, many of which argue the U.S. isn't facing an \"invasion\" or migrants aren't receiving enough due process to contest their deportations. A \"60 Minutes\" investigation found many migrants sent to El Salvador didn't have criminal records.",
      "Tuesday's ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit marks the latest court decision to push back on the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling \u2014 which was issued by a three-judge panel, with one dissenter \u2014 found the situation with Tren de Aragua does not meet the definition of either an \"invasion\" or a \"predatory incursion.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued Tren de Aragua is engaged in an incursion because its members have perpetrated \"mass illegal migration.\" The appeals court rejected this argument.",
      "\"A country's encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt, or to otherwise harm the United States,\" the court said. \"There is no finding that this mass immigration was an armed, organized force or forces.\"",
      "The appellate judges granted a preliminary injunction blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas. The court said the government can still remove the migrants under other legal authorities.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The ruling came in a case that has darted back and forth through the federal judiciary for months, eventually reaching the Supreme Court in the spring.",
      "The case was brought by migrants who were detained in Texas and sued to block their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The district court did not grant them relief, and the Fifth Circuit said they didn't have jurisdiction to intervene. But the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the migrants' removal in April, and a month later, the high court said the Fifth Circuit was wrong to dismiss the appeal and sent the case back to the appellate court for further review.",
      "The Supreme Court also said the government hadn't given the migrants enough notice of their impending deportations, after they said they were told just 24 hours in advance.",
      "Since then, the government has filed an updated notice that gave migrants seven days' warning of their deportation. The Fifth Circuit said that is likely enough time to satisfy the migrants' right to due process, but sent the issue back to the district court for further review.",
      "The ruling was penned by Judge Leslie Southwick, who was nominated by President George W. Bush. Biden-nominated Judge Irma Carrillo Ramirez concurred with the part of the ruling that said there isn't an \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion,\" but said seven days' notice isn't enough.",

      "But a handful of other GOP priorities \u2014 from cracking down on crime to fast-tracking President Trump's nominees \u2014 have surfaced in recent weeks, along with lingering tensions and partisan disagreements, promising a chaotic return to Washington, and a lengthy to-do list.",
      "Here's what's on lawmakers' agenda as Congress returns:",
      "Government funding fight",
      "A familiar deadline is fast approaching, as Congress must race to keep the government funded by Sept. 30.",
      "While the House and Senate each passed a small number of funding bills before leaving Washington for the August recess, the two chambers have been on different pages when it comes to funding levels. Getting all 12 individual appropriations bills through both chambers is unlikely, meaning lawmakers will almost certainly have to rely on a short-term measure to keep the government funded.",
      "The dynamic isn't unusual. Congress regularly struggles to approve the new funding before the end of the fiscal year, opting instead to push the deadline down the road by keeping the government funded at current levels on a temporary basis. But this time around, the funding fight itself has taken on new meaning.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer came under intense scrutiny from his own party during the last funding fight in March. After pledging to fight the GOP plan, which increased defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels, he changed course at the eleventh hour. Ultimately, Schumer opted to deliver one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown, arguing that a shutdown risked more damage.",
      "This time around, Democratic leaders have worked to engage on the funding issue well ahead of the deadline. Early last month, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a \"Big Four\" meeting with their GOP counterparts to discuss funding the government. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Democrats said that \"it is clear that the Trump Administration and many within your party are preparing to 'go it alone' and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis.\"",
      "Still, the letter didn't appear to kickstart a bipartisan effort. And Mr. Trump, asked about meeting with the Democratic leaders last month, said he would do it, while saying it's \"almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything.\" The Democrats renewed their call for a meeting between congressional leaders last week, writing that the \"government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way. That is the only viable path forward.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have bemoaned the White House's efforts to claw back funds already appropriated in what's known as a rescissions package earlier this year, along with a new push by the administration last week to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress already approved. The rarely used maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, is an attempt to rescind funding unilaterally, sparking pushback on Capitol Hill and bipartisan criticism as an \"unlawful\" move.",
      "\"Today's announcement of the Administration's plan to advance an unlawful 'pocket rescission' package is further proof President Trump and Congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and 'going it alone' this fall,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "The dynamics put the parties on a collision course heading toward the Sept. 30 deadline.",
      "While Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, they will need 60 votes in the Senate to keep the government funded, meaning they will need the support of at least seven Democrats.",
      "At the same time, some in the party, including Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, have encouraged Democrats to let the government shut down to protest Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "\"We cannot be the only one playing by the rules with a hand tied behind our backs,\" Martin said. \"That old playbook, the norms that, you know, used to have guardrails on our democracy and protect all of us in this country \u2014 that doesn't exist anymore. We've got to throw that playbook out the window because the Republicans have.\"",
      "Changes to Senate nomination rules",
      "Senators left Washington after a bruising nominations saga in July. Democrats have slow-walked Mr. Trump's nominees in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay confirmations nearly across the board. Senate Democrats were unable to come to an agreement with the White House in an episode that foreshadowed a larger fight to come.",
      "\"Donald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names \u2014 but he got nothing. And he walked away with his tail between his legs,\" Schumer told reporters before leaving for the August recess.",
      "Schumer has railed against the White House for walking away from a deal involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Meanwhile, the president called the Democrat's demands \"egregious and unprecedented.\"",
      "Without a deal, Senate Republicans are expected to pursue changes to the nominations process that would allow them to more swiftly confirm the president's nominees upon their return.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, urged in an op-ed last week that it's \"time to change Senate confirmation rules\" amid what he described as a \"bitter fight\" over even routine nominations. He said that the Senate GOP is \"considering changes to the Senate rules to end the most egregious delay tactics.\"",
      "\"Senate Republicans are determined to confirm Mr. Trump's qualified nominees one way or another,\" Barrasso wrote.",
      "What the changes look like remains to be seen. Both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process in recent years, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Confirming Trump's nominees for BLS chair and Fed governor",
      "The possible changes to the confirmation process come as a handful of new high-profile nominees are expected to come before the Senate, in addition to the dozens already awaiting votes.",
      "Mr. Trump fired the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last month over a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. He soon announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the agency. Mr. Trump said in his announcement that Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "But the nominee could face pushback in the Senate, with questions about his experience and comments he's made suggesting the monthly jobs report should be suspended.",
      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is planning to hold a confirmation hearing for Antoni pending completed paperwork, according to a committee spokesperson. The panel includes a handful of Senate Republicans who have pushed back on some of Mr. Trump's most controversial nominees this year: Sen. Bill Cassidy of Tennessee, the committee chairman, along with Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Democrats on the committee demanded that the panel hold a full hearing on Antoni's nomination. And Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called Antoni \"an unqualified right-wing extremist who won't think twice about manipulating BLS data.\"",
      "The Senate is also expected to work to confirm Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump announced the nomination in August after Adriana Kugler stepped down. The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a confirmation hearing this week. But Democrats on the committee have called for a delay, seeking instead to hold an oversight hearing on Mr. Trump's moves to fire another member of the Fed board.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said he had fired another member of the Fed board, Lisa Cook, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Governors can only be fired \"for cause\" and Cook has refused to resign. She sued the president to block her firing last week.",
      "The push to oust Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could also tee up another Senate confirmation process. The upper chamber confirmed Monarez for the post in late July, though she had been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "Trump seeks crime bill, extension of DC police takeover",
      "Mr. Trump has moved to crack down on crime in the nation's capital by federalizing the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. He signaled in recent weeks that he plans to ask Congress to approve \"long-term extensions\" to maintain control of D.C.'s police, along with other measures to address crime.",
      "In an Aug. 11 executive order, Mr. Trump directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of D.C. police for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act,\" which the president can extend for up to 30 days. Any extension beyond that requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate. That could run into trouble in the Senate, where the Republican majority would need the support of at least seven Democrats to move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump also indicated last month that he plans to seek around $2 billion from Congress to renovate the streets of Washington. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said the White House was working on a package \"to improve the safety and quality of life in our nation's capital\" which he and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama would spearhead.",
      "\"He wants $2.5 billion, I'm going to try to find him the money, to repave the roads, take the graffiti off the building, refurbish the parts and give homeless people some place to go other than a tent on the side of the road,\" Graham said at an event in South Carolina last month.",
      "Mr. Trump has suggested that his crackdown on crime in D.C. could soon extend to other major cities, though he has unique authority in the nation's capital because the district is ultimately controlled by the federal government. Last week, the president wrote in a post on Truth Social about a crime bill, saying he's working with GOP leaders in Congress on the measure, though the details remained unclear.",
      "\"Speaker Mike Johnson, and Leader John Thune, are working with me, and other Republicans, on a Comprehensive Crime Bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's what our Country need, and NOW! More to follow.\"",
      "Push for Epstein files",
      "Lawmakers were on recess for weeks, but the calls for access to files in the case of late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein haven't gone away.",
      "Controversy has swirled around the Epstein files since the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking, died in federal custody in 2019. But renewed interest in the files has prompted members of both parties to call for more transparency, while dividing Mr. Trump's base.",
      "As House Democrats and some Republicans pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the Epstein files in late July, Johnson opted to send the House home early. But some lawmakers are still pressing ahead.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July to compel the Justice Department to release the files within 30 days, with plans to force a vote on the measure once lawmakers return from recess. Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol Wednesday alongside survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "The expected moves in Congress come after the administration late last month released transcripts of a two-day interview with Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, that was conducted in Florida in July.

      "Washington \u2014 Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention penned an op-ed Monday condemning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership in the aftermath of the firing of the CDC director last week, claiming he is \"endangering every American's health.\"",
      "\"What the health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has done to the CDC and to our nation's public health system over the past several months \u2014 culminating in his decision to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as CDC director days ago \u2014 is unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency and unlike anything our country had ever experienced,\" the nine former directors and acting directors wrote in the op-ed in The New York Times.",
      "The Trump administration attempted to oust CDC Director Susan Monarez last week, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her firing. Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials have resigned in recent days, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "In their op-ed, the former CDC directors who served under both Democrat and Republican administrations, pointed to a number of decisions by Kennedy that they say are \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" including canceling investments into medical research and the move to replace members on a key vaccine advisory committee, among other things.",
      "\"Firing Dr. Monarez \u2014 which led to the resignations of top CDC officials \u2014 adds considerable fuel to this raging fire,\" the former CDC directors added.",
      "The CDC leaders said they \"applaud Dr. Monarez for standing up for the agency and the health of our communities.\"",
      "\"The loss of Dr. Monarez and other top leaders will make it far more difficult for the CDC to do what it has done for about 80 years: work around the clock to protect Americans from threats to their lives and health,\" they wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, the former CDC directors also called on Congress to exercise its oversight authority over the department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is one of a number of agencies under the HHS umbrella.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on HHS last week\u00a0 to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for Sept. 18 amid the slew of CDC departures. And the Louisiana Republican, who delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's confirmation as secretary, also said the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "When Cassidy was asked Tuesday evening if he regretted his vote to confirm Kennedy, he said, \"This is about children's health.\"",
      "\"This is about how we protect the children of the United States of America,\" Cassidy continued. \"And there's allegations that that health is being endangered. I'm not presupposing anybody's right or wrong. We got to get to the bottom of it, and it'll take radical transparency. My colleagues agree with that.\"",
      "In an appearance on Fox News last week after the CDC director firing, Kennedy said he wouldn't comment on personnel, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to appear before the Senate Finance Committee Thursday to testify on President Trump's health care agenda.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, says the timing of the op-ed \"has everything to do with Dr. Monarez's firing last week,\" but she added that \"the concerns that they outlined are really about politics and ideology taking precedence over public health and science.\"",
      "Citing the firings of federal health workers across HHS, the weakening of public health programs, questions about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines amid a serious measles outbreak in Texas, among other things, Gounder said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" that \"we really are very concerned about how this is now diminishing trust in the very most basic of public health infrastructure in this country.\"",

      "President Trump suggested Tuesday he's planning to send National Guard troops to Chicago, in what could be the latest salvo in his controversial push to use federal forces to address crime, drawing pushback from local political leaders.",
      "\"We're going in. I didn't say when, we're going in,\" Mr. Trump said in an Oval Office event, after a reporter asked if he plans to send the Guard to Chicago.",
      "Mr. Trump did not specify whether his administration will primarily send Guard forces or federal law enforcement agents to Chicago. He also didn't say how many Guard troops could be deployed, or where they will hail from.",
      "He later suggested Baltimore could also draw a federal response.",
      "The president has vowed for weeks to intervene in Chicago and Baltimore, arguing the two cities have failed to contain violent crime. Chicago could be the third city to face a crackdown under the Trump administration: Thousands of Guard troops and federal agents have been deployed to the streets of Washington, D.C., since last month as part of an anti-crime initiative, and Guard forces were sent to Los Angeles in June to protect immigration agents.",
      "Mr. Trump said he hopes Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker \u2014 a vociferous Trump critic \u2014 will call him and request that troops be sent to Chicago. But the president said: \"We're going to do it anyway. We have the right to do it because I have an obligation to protect this country.\"",
      "In a press conference Tuesday, Pritzker called Mr. Trump's comments \"unhinged.\"",
      "\"No, I will not call the president asking him to send troops to Chicago,\" he said.",
      "Pritzker said he expects federal agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies to surge in Chicago in the coming days. He said the president could then \"use any excuse\" to deploy military personnel.",
      "The governor said his administration is \"ready to fight troop deployments in court.\"",
      "Any Guard deployment to Chicago would likely draw legal pushback.",
      "The D.C. National Guard is controlled by the president, but the 50 states' Guard forces are typically run by governors. Mr. Trump called members of the California National Guard into federal service without Gov. Gavin Newsom's permission by invoking a law that applies to rebellions or situations where the president can't enforce the law with \"regular forces.\"",
      "Newsom sued the Trump administration over the move. An appeals court ruled that Mr. Trump likely had the right to call up the California National Guard, but a lower court judge on Tuesday ruled the deployment violated a 19th century law prohibiting the military from being used for domestic law enforcement.",
      "Trump calls Chicago a \"mess\" \u2014 Pritzker calls his claims \"absurd\"",
      "The president has zeroed in on cracking down on crime in the nation's major cities, beginning with the effort in D.C. \u2014 despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the crackdown in the nation's capital, he said the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and suggesting it could then move to other cities. Since then, he has publicly lashed out over Chicago's murder rate.",
      "\"We have other cities also that are bad. Very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is,\" Mr. Trump said last month. \"We're not going to lose our cities over this.\"",
      "The president later praised the National Guard's work with the police in D.C., saying, \"After we do this, we'll go to another location, and we'll make it safe, also.\"",
      "\"Chicago's a mess, you have an incompetent mayor, grossly incompetent,\" Mr. Trump said last month. \"And we'll straighten that one out, probably next \u2013 that will be our next one after this.\"",
      "The president predicted that, within a week of a federal intervention in Chicago, \"We will have no crime in Chicago just like we have no crime in D.C.\"",
      "In Tuesday's press conference, Pritzker said \"there is no emergency that warrants deployment of troops.\" He called Mr. Trump's characterization of crime in Chicago \"absurd\" and pointed to recent reductions in homicides, shootings and other violent crimes according to city statistics.",
      "\"One violent crime is too many, and we have more work to do,\" Pritzker said. \"But we have made important progress on safety that Trump is now jeopardizing.\"",

      "\"I stopped seven wars, and they were, they're big ones too,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "\"I've settled six wars, and a lot of people say seven because there's one that nobody knows about,\" he said in an August 19 interview.",

      "\"There has been more progress towards peace than ever before because of this President's leadership,\" the official wrote.",
      "The recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace prize is expected to be announced next month.",
      "Over 100 people have received the award since the 19th-century chemist Alfred Nobel created the prize to honor a \"person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"",
      "Four U.S. presidents have been past laureates, most recently Barack Obama who received the prize for supporting nuclear nonproliferation and international diplomacy.",
      "Foreign policy experts say that while Mr. Trump has helped broker ceasefires, including one between Israel and Iran, several of the foreign conflicts cited by the administration were not full-scale wars \u2014 and many remain unresolved. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification on why the president has repeatedly labeled all seven conflicts as settled wars.",
      "Some of these peace efforts involved limited U.S. involvement, and in other instances, it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump's role was decisive.",
      "Here's a look at the conflicts:",
      "Israel and Iran",
      "After Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities in June, a 12-day conflict resulted in the deaths of\u00a0 about 28 Israelis and hundreds of Iranians before a ceasefire was reached with U.S. and Qatari involvement. Mr. Trump claimed credit, saying he had ordered U.S. airstrikes on Iran's uranium enrichment sites and pressed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold back from further strikes.",
      "Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at Brookings, said Mr. Trump deserves some credit for this ceasefire. \"He managed to use a combination of a good relationship with Netanyahu, but also a willingness to put a little pressure on Netanyahu that I think contributed to the at least temporary cessation of hostilities,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "But other foreign policy experts said tensions between the nations are far from resolved, and Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in early July that the Defense Department estimated the U.S. strikes likely delayed Iran's nuclear program by \"one to two years.\"",
      "Larry Haas, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said, \"I very strongly disagree with the notion that the president brought peace to Iran and Israel. We may be in a quiet period in terms of direct confrontation, but Iran right now is trying to regroup.\"",
      "Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo",
      "In June, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo announced a peace deal after multiple days of talks in Washington mediated by President Trump and Qatar.",
      "The deal aimed to end three decades of fighting over Congo's mineral reserves. Yet the violence has continued, with both sides accusing each other of violating peace terms. Human Rights Watch reported that M23, an armed group that U.S. officials believe is backed by Rwanda, killed over 140 civilians in eastern Congo in July.",
      "\"It's a premature declaration of success, when in fact we are just getting to the starting line,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan",
      "In August, Mr. Trump helped negotiate an agreement aimed at normalizing relations and\u00a0 reopening transportation routes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have spent decades fighting for control of the Karabakh region.",
      "O'Hanlon and Haas agreed the Trump administration pushed the deal forward in part by inviting both leaders to the White House. Leaders of both countries also credited Mr. Trump for the agreement, saying he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But the deal is not a formal peace agreement and requires ratification. One remaining sticking point is that Azerbaijan wants Armenia to remove any mention of territorial claims to Azerbaijan's land from its constitution before officials sign a final deal.\u00a0 Armenia's prime minister has expressed willingness to change the constitution but has not specified a date for a referendum.",
      "Thailand and Cambodia",
      "In late July, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a ceasefire after an outbreak of fighting killed at least 35 people. President Trump said that he had pressured both sides to come to the table by threatening trade consequences.",
      "The U.S. is a top importer for both counties, and foreign policy experts CBS News spoke to said Mr. Trump's tariff threats played a significant role in securing a ceasefire. \"He helped move things along with economic pressure,\" Haas said.",
      "The border dispute is continuing, though, with Thai officials accusing Cambodia of laying new landmines. Cambodia denied doing so.",
      "India and Pakistan",
      "India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in May after weeks of cross-border missile and drone strikes. The deal ended the latest flare-up in their long-running dispute over Kashmir, which both nuclear-armed nations claim as their territory.",
      "Pakistan credited the Trump administration's efforts in U.S.-led talks, and nominated him for the Nobel Peace prize. But India insisted its own pressure on Pakistan, not U.S. diplomacy, drove the deal.",
      "Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it's a stretch to call the dispute over Kashmir settled.",
      "\"There is no real ending to this conflict,\" he said, noting that future negotiations could be complicated by Mr. Trump's decision to impose steep tariffs on India, a key partner.",
      "Egypt and Ethiopia",
      "Mr. Trump also claims he brokered peace between Ethiopia and Egypt, which have disagreed about Ethiopia's decision to construct a hydroelectric dam in the Nile.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump tried to broker a deal between the countries and suspended some aid to Ethiopia because of a lack of progress. In June, the president mentioned the dispute on Truth Social, writing, \"There is peace, at least for now, because of my intervention, and it will stay that way!\"",
      "No deals have been announced, however. Ethiopia still plans to officially open its dam in September over Egypt's objections that it will restrict the flow of water to its country. And while Egypt previously threatened to go to war over the dam, this conflict has remained a diplomatic one.",
      "O'Hanlon said of the dispute, \"I would not call the Egypt-Ethiopia interaction a war.\"",
      "Serbia and Kosovo",
      "In 2020, President Trump helped negotiate a deal between Serbia and Kosovo to help normalize economic ties, but progress stalled afterwards.",
      "Talks have continued with European leaders, but no breakthroughs have emerged. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which Serbia still does not recognize.",

      "President Trump announced Tuesday afternoon that U.S. Space Command headquarters is moving from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama.",
      "In 2018 he had signed an order reestablishing U.S. Space Command, after it had been absorbed in 2002 into U.S. Strategic Command. Its main goal is to find ways to defend U.S. interests in space. In 2023, President Joe Biden had decided\u00a0instead to keep Space Command headquarters in Colorado, where its temporary headquarters was located, overturning Mr. Trump's first-term decision to move it to Alabama.",
      "Biden had been convinced by the head of Space Command at the time that moving its headquarters would jeopardize military readiness. His reversal prompted the House Armed Services Committee, chaired by Republican Mike Rogers of Alabama, to request the Pentagon's watchdog investigate the basing decision.",
      "The Defense Department inspector general said in a report that Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, would be the Air Force's preferred location for the command, but building facilities equal to the ones that were already in Colorado could take three to four years. According to the IG's report, Army Gen. James Dickinson, then the commander of U.S. Space Command, voiced concerns about the timeline's impact on the command's readiness, which contributed to the decision Biden had made to keep the headquarters in Colorado."

    "story": [
      "A new cryptocurrency issued by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial\u00a0and that started trading this week has boosted the family's wealth on paper by roughly $5 billion despite the digital token sinking in its first two days of being listed on the exchange.",
      "The crypto, called WLFI, reached a high of about 40 cents after launching on Monday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. By Tuesday morning, the value of the token had fallen to as low as about 21 cents, down 48% from its peak, before recovering to about 23 cents in the afternoon.",
      "Even with the decline, the Trump family's stake in WLFI is worth about $5 billion based on its holdings of 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. Mr. Trump and his family aren't yet able to sell their holdings as its founders' tokens remained locked, according to World Liberty Financial.",
      "World Liberty Financial didn't immediately return a request for comment. Here's what to know about the company's token.",
      "Trump's support for crypto",
      "Once an avowed skeptic of cryptocurrency, Mr. Trump has championed the digital asset in his second term, vowing to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial and the Trump family's other private crypto ventures have raised concerns among some watchdog groups and Democratic lawmakers over potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\"The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "In July, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies, into law. The act established federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The surging value of World Liberty Financial, whose co-founders include Mr. Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, underscores the president's growing interest in cryptocurrency, a focus that spans both personal investments and policy moves during his presidency. Those efforts include\u00a0$TRUMP and $Melania meme coins, which are cryptos whose value is linked to internet trends and which began trading in January.",
      "What is WLFI?",
      "WLFI is a token, or a digital asset, that guarantees its holders the right to vote on governance issues for World Liberty Financial, according to the company.",
      "World Liberty Financial cautions token owners that WLFI isn't an investment, with its terms stating: \"You should not acquire $WLFI as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, for a financial purpose or with an expectation of resale for a profit or otherwise.\"",
      "The early swing in WLFI's price isn't unusual for tokens making their market debut, said Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, a provider of crypto and blockchain information.",
      "\"The price action from 40 cents to 21 cents is typical for new token launches,\" Puckrin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Early hype usually drives initial spikes, followed by a wave of selling as early entrants take profits.\"",
      "He added, \"Compared to other major token debuts, WLFI's decline is relatively moderate, and early backers have still seen strong returns from private sales.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial also offers a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Because stablecoins are linked to fixed assets, they are generally seen as less volatile to other cryptos.",
      "\"WLFI is carving out a unique position by offering token holders real governance rights over the direction of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin that is growing rapidly,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That's important because WLFI holders, through their governance votes, can help influence the future development and policies of USD1 and World Liberty Financial's policies, he added. That capacity \"sets it apart in a crowded market,\" he said.",
      "What about insider concentration risk?",
      "The Trump family and other insiders own more than 20% of the WLFI tokens, according to World Liberty Financial's site.",
      "But World Liberty Financial's terms note that no single digital wallet can exercise more than 5% of governance power, which should deter outsized insider influence, Puckrin said.",
      "What's happening with Mr. Trump's other crypto ventures?",
      "In May, the $TRUMP meme coin drew scrutiny when the venture offered its top holders the chance to join Mr. Trump for dinner. Investors spent about $140 million to snap up the coins and secure an invite to the event, data showed at the time.",
      "That sparked concerns from government watchdogs and some Democratic lawmakers that the Trump-branded asset was being linked to gain access to the president.",
      "As investors snapped up the meme coin, the asset's value almost doubled to about $15 in May. Since then, the coin has given up most of the gains and was trading at about $8.30 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 the owner of the Truth Social app \u2014 has expanded into crypto in recent months. In July, it bought about $2 billion in cryptocurrencies\u00a0to refashion the business as an investment firm.",

    "summary": "GOP Rep. Thomas Massie took the first step in forcing a House vote to compel the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, filed a discharge petition\u00a0on Tuesday to attempt to force a House vote on compelling the release of files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, resurfacing the saga upon Congress' return.",
      "Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced\u00a0legislation\u00a0in July that would require the Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days. They planned to force a vote on the bill once lawmakers returned from their lengthy August recess.",
      "Although leadership controls the House's agenda and what legislation receives a vote, individual lawmakers can \"discharge\" legislation that has been sitting in committee. A discharge petition enables 218 members, a majority of the lower chamber, to provide their signatures and effectively bypass leadership to bring a bill before the full House for a vote.",
      "Khanna told NPR News on Tuesday that he's \"very confident\" all 212 Democrats will support the petition, along with more than the six Republicans needed to force a vote in the House.",
      "Before lawmakers left Washington, House Democrats and some Republicans had pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the files, but House Speaker Mike Johnson opted to send the House home early amid the pressure. As lawmakers returned to Washington on Tuesday, House Republican leadership added a bill to the House schedule for the week that would direct the House Oversight Committee to \"continue its ongoing investigation into the possible mismanagement of the Federal government's investigation of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell,\" Epstein's co-conspirator who is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "Massie criticized the move, calling it a \"meaningless vote to provide political cover for those members who don't support our bipartisan legislation to force the release of the Epstein files.\"",
      "Johnson told reporters in response that he would describe \"virtually everything Thomas Massie says related to this issue as meaningless.\" And the speaker defended how the administration and Congress have approached the documents so far, telling CBS News that \"there's been a lot of things that transpired over the August district work period.\"",
      "\"The Oversight Committee is well underway, the administration is complying. The Department of Justice complied with all the subpoenas they received and are processing 34,000 documents already,\" Johnson said. \"And we're going to move that along as quickly as possible so that all of this is pushed out to the public so the American people can make their own decisions.\"",
      "Epstein was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019 in what numerous investigations deemed a suicide. But the push to release the Epstein files reached a fever pitch, including among President Trump's base, after the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. And the development has prompted calls for more transparency from both sides of the aisle.",
      "Members of the House Oversight Committee are meeting with survivors of Epstein's abuse Tuesday. And Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol on Wednesday alongside survivors.",
      "The developments come after the Trump administration released transcripts of a two-day interview with Maxwell late last month. The Oversight Committee has also said it plans to make public records it received from the Justice Department related to Epstein after redactions have been made.",
      "Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, told Fox News on Sunday that \"we're going to make this information public \u2014 that's what the American people want,\" while noting that \"it's very complicated because there are victims of the Epstein files, and we want to listen to those victims and their families and their attorneys to see how best can we present this information.\"",

    "summary": "The climate experts say the July report from the Trump administration fails to \"adequately represent the current scientific understanding of climate change.\"",
    "story": [
      "An international group of more than 85 climate experts on Tuesday published a 439-page review arguing that a report by the Trump administration's Energy Department fails to \"adequately represent the current scientific understanding of climate change,\" and it \"exhibits pervasive problems\" by misrepresenting scientific literature and cherry-picking data.",
      "The Department of Energy's 151-page report, \"A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,\" was written by five authors who were hand-selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fossil fuel executive. It included a controversial conclusion that \"carbon dioxide-induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed,\" and it states that \"aggressive mitigation strategies\" to address greenhouse gas emissions \"could be more harmful than beneficial\" \u2014 a statement that supports the oil and gas industry.",
      "\"Climate change is real, and it deserves attention. But it is not the greatest threat facing humanity,\" Wright said in a statement supporting the report's publication and conclusions.",
      "In August, environmental groups and independent scientists sued the Energy Department over the report, arguing the way it was written and produced violated transparency laws. Tuesday's review is the latest in a series of actions climate experts have taken to tackle the Energy report that they say is an insult to climate and environmental science.",
      "\"Climate science is probably one of the most robust and scrutinized scientific fields in the history of science because of the economic implications,\" said Andrew Dessler, director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M University, who felt the report made \"a mockery of science.\"",
      "He immediately expressed his frustration on social media and discovered he wasn't the only one upset by the report.",
      "\"I can't tell you how many people looked at this and agreed with me that this was a mockery and we needed to respond to it,\" Dessler told CBS News.",
      "In less than a month, Dessler helped organize more than 85 international climate experts, mostly from universities, from the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and Canada, who voluntarily reviewed the DOE report and found that it was \"full of errors,\" \"biased\" and \"not fit to inform policy.\"",
      "They have submitted their response to the DOE, which provided a 30-day window for public comment on the report. As of Sept. 1, there were more than 2,333 comments submitted.",
      "Asked about the criticism, the Department of Energy told CBS News in a statement, \"Unlike previous administrations, the Trump administration is committed to engaging in a more thoughtful and science-based conversation about climate change and energy. Following the public comment period, we look forward to reviewing and engaging on substantive comments.\"",
      "\"We have no idea what they're gonna do with the comments,\" said Dessler, \"They're never going to convince people that carbon dioxide isn't important, but what they want to do is create doubt.\"",
      "Dessler and his colleagues are not the only ones who are concerned about the DOE report and its findings. The American Meteorological Society also published its own response, finding \"five foundational flaws\" that it says \"places the report at odds with scientific principles and practices.\"",
      "The review spends the majority of the 439 pages outlining the list of errors experts found, which Dessler described as, \"selectively\" citing scientific literature, saying, \"How can you provide a respectable view of science when you don't know what the literature says, you're not reading it, you're not citing it ... and you're not giving the right context.\"",
      "But some critics say the report by the DOE is representative of a larger trend in the federal government under the Trump administration to organize selective committees that publish reports, which are politically advantageous to support policy decisions.",
      "\"It's clear that this administration wants to take control, at the political level, of the scientific process of the government,\" said Dr. John Balbus, who was formerly at the Department of Health and Human Services as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate Change and Health Equity.",
      "Balbus points to a similar playbook occurring at HHS around vaccines and political appointees relying on questionable opinions and misrepresentations of scientific reports to come to a conclusion that vaccines cause more harm than good, \"Which is a ludicrous and completely unsubstantiated assertion,\" he says.",
      "Although the Trump administration has fired thousands of scientists and experts across several government agencies, many have regrouped in the private sector to launch coordinated responses to counter the misinformation they perceive is being broadcast by the federal government.",
      "Last month, several major health organizations issued their own guidelines on COVID-19 vaccines, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, which runs counter to the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In May, after President Trump fired 400 scientists who were working to publish the nation's major quadrennial report on the impacts of climate change in the U.S., two scientific groups announced a plan to publish a special collection focused on the subject to ensure the scientists' work can be accessed.",
      "In addition to these efforts, many federal employees that remain with agencies have taken the risk of signing letters to Congress to express their concerns about changes in policy, including members of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency, both of which have faced retaliation for these efforts.",
      "\"When you see nearly a thousand public servants risking their livelihoods to alert the public that senior officials cannot be trusted, that is a clear warning,\" said Balbus, who believes these individuals will continue to sustain their fight against misinformation, as long as they're allowed to.",

      "Ernst's decision not to seek reelection opens up a seat in Iowa, where Democrats are hoping to make inroads as the party seeks to take control of the Senate in the midterm elections. But a Democratic candidate would face steep odds in a state Mr. Trump won by more than 13 points in 2024, and Iowa hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 2008.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal court in California ruled Tuesday that the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed members of the National Guard and active-duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles earlier this summer in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations.",
      "In a 52-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the president and his administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 1878 law that prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Breyer blocked the Trump administration from deploying or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops in the state, for civilian law enforcement.",
      "His decision restricts the use of service members to engage in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures and traffic and crowd control. The injunction applies only to the Trump administration's use of the National Guard in California, not nationally, and it does not require the Defense Department to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops who remain in Los Angeles. Breyer noted that the administration is not prohibited from using troops consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, and wrote that they can continue to protect federal property in a manner allowed under the law.",
      "The judge froze his injunction until noon on Sept. 12, likely to allow the Trump administration time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.",
      "\"Today, the court sided with democracy and the Constitution. No president is a king \u2014 not even Trump \u2014 and no president can trample a state's power to protect its people,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in response to the decision. He said Mr. Trump's use of the military \"as his personal police force is illegal, authoritarian, and must be stopped in every courtroom across this country.\"",
      "Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, indicated that the Justice Department will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"Once again, a rogue judge is trying to usurp the authority of the commander-in-chief to protect American cities from violence and destruction. President Trump saved Los Angeles, which was overrun by deranged leftist lunatics sowing mass chaos until he stepped in,\" she said in a statement. \"While far-left courts try to stop President Trump from carrying out his mandate to Make America Safe Again, the president is committed to protecting law-abiding citizens, and this will not be the final say on the issue.\"",
      "Breyer's ruling came after he held a three-day trial in the case brought by Newsom in June. The Democratic governor\u00a0sued in response to Mr. Trump's decision to deploy members of California's National Guard to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement operations taking place in the area. The president invoked a law known as Title 10 to send the California National Guard to Los Angeles to protect federal property and personnel.",
      "The judge granted temporary relief to California officials in June that required the Trump administration not to deploy the California National Guard in Los Angeles and return control to Newsom. But a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit found it likely that Mr. Trump lawfully federalized the California National Guard under a different law, Title 10.",
      "Those earlier proceedings did not involve the Posse Comitatus Act. Breyer, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, held the trial on the merits of Newsom's arguments that the president violated that 147-year-old law last month.",
      "The judge's ruling",
      "The judge wrote in his ruling that the evidence put forth at the trial established that the Trump administration \"systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles. In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "While the Pentagon withdrew roughly the 700 U.S. Marines who had been sent to Los Angeles, Breyer noted that there are still 300 National Guard members stationed there nearly three months after they were first mobilized.",
      "\"Moreover, President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country \u2014 including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California \u2014 thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "The judge said that the Trump administration intentionally initiated the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to establish a military presence there and enforce federal law. He called that conduct a \"serious violation\" of federal law prohibiting the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.",
      "\"In fact, these violations were part of a top-down, systemic effort by Defendants to use military troops to execute various sectors of federal law (the drug laws and the immigration laws at least) across hundreds of miles and over the course of several months \u2014 and counting,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the president's constitutional powers allow him to override the restrictions in the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "\"Under this 'constitutional exception,' as Defendants call it, the President has inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions, so any actions that can be construed as such 'protection' are lawful in spite of the Posse Comitatus Act,\" he wrote. \"This assertion is not grounded in the history of the Act, Supreme Court jurisprudence on executive authority, or common sense.\"",
      "The judge said that Congress was clear about what constitutes an exception to the law, precluding the president from exercising all but his express authority under the Constitution. He also accused the Trump administration of attempting to usurp Congress' authority.",
      "\"That Defendants characterize this as an 'exception' to the statute is mere wordplay; it does not change the fact that they seek to override Congress's legitimate exercise of its own authority,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "Attorneys for California had sought an injunction that blocked National Guard forces from participating in and protecting federal agents during immigration enforcement operations, and Breyer agreed to grant their request. The Trump administration had argued that Title 10 is an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act and therefore didn't apply to National Guard troops who were called into federal service.",
      "The judge wrote that while there is \"no question that federal personnel should be able to perform their jobs without fearing for their safety,\" the Trump administration cannot \"use this as a hook to send military troops alongside federal agents wherever they go.\"",
      "Since the 9th Circuit allowed the Trump administration to keep the National Guard in California, the president has moved to deploy troops to Washington, D.C.\u00a0Mr. Trump has also teased sending the National Guard to other major cities throughout the country in what he casts as a looming crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.",
      "As of Monday, there are over 2,200 National Guard members in Washington, D.C., with over half of those troops sent by Republican governors throughout the country.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 11:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Deputy HHS secretary Jim O'Neill is also serving as acting CDC director as RFK Jr.'s newly appointed vaccine advisory panel prepares for its first meeting.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is at a crossroads. Last week, CDC Director Susan Monarez was ousted less than a month into her tenure after resisting Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s push to align with his vaccine policy agenda. Within hours, three senior leaders \u2014 including the chief medical officer and the heads of vaccine safety and respiratory infections \u2014 resigned in protest. Their exits capped weeks of mounting tension: biased scientific reviews, the withdrawal of key documents, and a shooting at CDC headquarters tied to COVID misinformation. Hundreds of staff publicly applauded the departing scientists in a rare \"clap-out.\"",
      "Into that vacuum stepped Jim O'Neill, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services, now installed as acting CDC director.",
      "O'Neill's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 breaks sharply with CDC tradition. A Bush-era HHS official turned Silicon Valley investor, he is neither a physician nor a scientist \u2014 an unusual profile for the agency's top post. He is expected to retain his deputy role at HHS while leading the CDC. After his early government service, O'Neill spent nearly two decades in close partnership with billionaire Peter Thiel, managing his funds, directing the Thiel Foundation, and co-founding the Thiel Fellowship. He also led the SENS Research Foundation, a nonprofit focused on anti-aging science. In June, he returned to Washington as deputy secretary; he now holds that position alongside his role as CDC director.",
      "Former colleagues on both sides of the aisle describe him as smart and diligent, with a deep knowledge of HHS mechanics. They also note his libertarian streak, which could align him well with Secretary Kennedy but set him at odds with school vaccination requirements. His most controversial stance, voiced in 2014, was that the FDA should approve drugs once proven safe, leaving effectiveness to be determined in the marketplace \u2014 a proposal widely criticized by public health experts as dangerous.",
      "O'Neill insists he is \"very strongly pro-vaccine,\" but his recent post on social media \u2014 asking if \"omicron is the best vaccine\" and suggesting CDC could \"redefine the word vaccine at will\" \u2014 sparked new concerns about his grasp of vaccine science. Experts counter that infection is not the same as vaccination, which confers protection without the risks of acute illness or long COVID.",
      "He could wear both hats for some time. The White House and Kennedy appear eager to avoid a bruising Senate confirmation fight. Until COVID, the CDC director was not a Senate-confirmed position; Republicans changed that in the pandemic's aftermath. Leaving O'Neill in an \"acting\" role could paralyze major decision-making at the agency for the foreseeable future.",
      "Meanwhile, the CDC's vaccine advisory committee \u2014 made up of all new Kennedy appointees \u2014 is preparing for a pivotal September meeting. On the agenda: the newborn hepatitis B dose, infant RSV protection, COVID vaccination for healthy children and young adults, and the combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella shot. Revisiting so many long-standing childhood immunizations at once would be unprecedented. If recommendations are weakened, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Vaccines for Children program could restrict coverage, creating new barriers for families.",
      "The stakes for CDC are profound. O'Neill has promised to \"refocus CDC on infectious disease\" and \"restore trust,\" yet staff and state partners say politicized decisions and budget cuts are already eroding core work.",
      "The September vaccine advisory meeting will be the first real test for O'Neill. If he restores scientific processes, including transparent reviews, expert briefings, and evidence being vetted and posted before votes, CDC insiders say he could stabilize morale at the agency and preserve the credibility of its scientifically based recommendations. If not, the resignations of senior scientists may prove the start of a broader exodus, leaving states and families without clear guidance just as flu, RSV and COVID converge this fall.",

      "Beijing \u2014\u00a0China will host its biggest military parade ever on Wednesday, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and Japan's formal surrender. The massive procession will go down Chang-an Avenue, the name of which means \"Eternal Peace.\"",
      "Joining Chinese Prime Minister Xi Jinping for the \"Victory Day\" event \u2014 which will showcase some of China's newest and most advanced weapons \u2014 will be Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.",
      "Rehearsals have been underway for weeks, and security in the sprawling Chinese capital has been extra tight. All buildings overlooking the parade route will be locked down as the leaders and other dignitaries from 26 countries take in the spectacle, along with some 50,000 spectators.",
      "For China's 72-year-old leader Xi, it will be a landmark moment. It's the third and most important military parade he will have overseen since coming to power in 2012. As commander-in-chief of the world's largest standing armed forces, he will watch as tens of thousands of troops under his orders march toward Tiananmen Square in central Beijing.",
      "It will be a visceral display not only of China's growing military might and newest hardware, including hypersonic weapons, nuclear capable missiles, fighter jets and underwater drones, but of its growing clout as a geopolitical power, with deepening ties to some of the United States' most potent adversaries.",
      "North Korea's Kim arrived in Beijing Tuesday aboard his green armored train, stopping to inspect one of his own country's missile production facilities on the way before crossing into China.",
      "The parade will be the first time that Kim appears together with both Xi and Putin \u2014 offering him a first multilateral diplomatic event.",
      "The symbolism of the three leaders together on a stage with Xi's military thundering past in formation will be undeniable. Xi is expected to be flanked by Putin and Kim. Together, they have been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts.",
      "Xi is bringing together the leaders of some of the most heavily sanctioned nations in the world. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian and the leader of Myanmar's ruling military junta, President Min Aung Hlaing, will also be attending, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "It is a clear show of solidarity against the West, and it's being seen as a direct challenge to the U.S.-led world order that has prevailed for a century. Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up that status quo clear for at least several years.",
      "\"We, together with you and with our sympathizers, will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\" Russia's longtime Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in 2022, ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "The gathering in Beijing will represent a clear challenge to President Trump's claim to be fostering close working relationships with Xi, Putin and Kim. Xi's bond with Putin was on clear and deliberate display in the days leading up to the parade.",
      "China and Russia have declared their \"no limits partnership,\" and while China claims to maintain a neutral stance on Russia's war in Ukraine, Beijing's support of the war effort \u2014 by providing dual-use technology and continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas in defiance of Western sanctions, has proven to be an economic lifeline funding Putin's three-and-a-half-year war.",
      "During talks at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday, Putin hailed \"unprecedentedly high relations\" with China and thanked his \"dear friend\" Xi for the warm welcome.",
      "Kim's support for Russia's war has been even more direct. Since October last year, North Korea has sent around 13,000 troops, along with conventional weapons, to support Russia's war effort. South Korea's intelligence services estimate that around 2,000 North Korean troops have been killed fighting alongside Russian forces.",
      "The parade will be a show of both China and Russia's implicit support for Kim's nuclear weapons program, which remains the subject of numerous United Nations sanctions.",
      "Xi burnished his credentials as a geopolitical powerbroker at a regional security summit in Tianjin, northern China, that ended on Monday. He hosted more than 20 world leaders there, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\"We should uphold fairness and justice,\" Xi declared at the gathering of the Shanghai Corporation Organization, seemingly trying to claim moral high ground amid the upheaval and strained relationships caused by Mr. Trump's global trade war and isolationist policies. \"We must oppose the Cold War mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices.\"",
      "Without mentioning the U.S. or its president by name, Xi told the assembled leaders of non-Western countries: \"We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics.\"",
      "On Monday Xi, Putin and Modi were shown together smiling and laughing at the summit \u2014 a deliberate public display of warmth and camaraderie. Just last week, the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a close ally of Mr. Trump, called the summit \"performative\" and accused China and India of being \"bad actors\" for fueling Russia's war.",
      "At the parade this week, Xi is not only asserting China as a reliable and stable partner, but also showing off his country's burgeoning alliances, influence and its military might and power.

    "story": [
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday signed a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to be more friendly to Republicans, capping off a redistricting push that drew national attention. It also led to California's Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats.",
      "Missouri is following Texas and California's lead, with the state's Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe announcing Friday that he had called for the state's Legislature to convene on Sept. 3 to redraw the state's congressional districts. Missouri has eight representatives in Congress, two of whom are Democrats.",
      "Challenges remain for both Texas and California's new maps. While Texas law only requires the Legislature and the governor's approval to set the congressional maps, civil rights groups have already challenged them in court, accusing the maps of being racially biased. The maps the GOP-controlled Legislature created in 2021 are still being litigated in court.",
      "In California, the state's congressional map must be approved by voters before it takes effect. The Democratic-controlled Assembly and State Senate both approved a measure called Proposition 50 for the Nov. 4 ballot that, if approved, will overhaul the state's congressional maps. California Republicans challenged the maps in court, saying Democrats ignored the 30-day public review period for new legislation, although the state Supreme Court denied the petition on Aug. 27.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off by President Trump in mid-July as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterm elections are often a rebuke of the party in the White House. Mr. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson zeroed in on Texas, with the president claiming Republicans could gain an extra five seats given how the state voted in 2024.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, with Indiana Republicans having met with Mr. Trump and members of his administration on Aug. 27 to try to redraw the state's nine congressional districts to try to oust the two Democratic members. Florida's Republican House speaker last month created a special committee to look into the possibility there.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their state's congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",

      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but where Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "In recent years, Texas Democrats have made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district out in the rural areas, making it a district that was 72% Democratic to one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also takes aim at Districts 32 and 33 in Dallas-Fort Worth, changing Rep. Julie Johnson's 32nd District from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's 33rd District remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts under the proposed maps. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California currently has 52 representatives in Congress, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats. The GOP has made inroads in the Golden State, starting in 2020, when Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. Republicans have held onto two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "Other Republican strongholds in Central California have been spread into other districts. Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, Districts 1 and 3 both have dramatic shifts. GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part is absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's 3rd Congressional District, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",

      "Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, will not seek reelection in 2026, stating that there's a \"necessity for generational change in the party.\"",
      "In an interview published Monday in The New York Times, Nadler said that after watching former President Joe Biden withdraw from the 2024 election following his rough debate against President Trump, he decided a younger successor \"can maybe do better, can maybe help us more.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying we should change over the entire party,\" Nadler told The New York Times. \"But I think a certain amount of change is very helpful, especially when we face the challenge of Trump and his incipient fascism.\"",
      "He did not tell the Times who he would prefer succeed him.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Nadler said that the decision to step down \"has not been easy.\"",
      "\"But I know in my heart it is the right one and that it is the right time to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't know what the future beyond 2026 holds, but I plan to stay fully engaged in the community that is my home and in the causes that I've championed throughout my life,\" Nadler continued. \"My plans for the next sixteen months, however, are clear. I will continue to give everything I have to defend our democracy, protect our institutions, and fight for the values that as Americans and New Yorkers we share.\"",
      "Nadler, 78, was first elected to Congress in 1992. He was chair of the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2023 and then served as ranking member until Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland launched his bid to unseat Nadler. The New York Democrat made the decision to step down in December 2024. Nadler also served as a manager of Mr. Trump's first impeachment.",
      "Nadler was facing a primary challenge from 26-year-old Liam Elkind. Elkind told CBS News in August that the party needs \"to be the party of fighters. We need to be the party of organizers. We need to be more generationally relevant, better organized and ready to fight.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in a statement called Nadler \"a relentless fighter for justice, civil rights and liberties and the fundamental promise of equality for all.\"",
      "\"As the legendary Chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, he helped lead two historic impeachments and ensure that no one, not even the President, is above the law,\" Jeffries said. \"In that role, he championed legislation to protect our democracy and the American way of life, fighting for women, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community, including enshrining into law the Respect for Marriage Act. ... Jerry's years of leadership have earned him a spot among our nation's greatest public servants. He will be deeply missed by the House Democratic Caucus next term and we wish him and his family the very best in this new chapter.\"",

      "President Trump announced Monday that he will award\u00a0Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.",
      "\"As President of the United States of America, I am pleased to announce that Rudy Giuliani, the greatest Mayor in the history of New York City, and an equally great American Patriot, will receive THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM, our Country's highest civilian honor,\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post. \"Details as to time and place to follow. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\u00a0 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement comes days after Giuliani was hospitalized with multiple broken bones\u00a0following a car crash in New Hampshire. Giuliani suffered \"fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg\" after the vehicle he was riding in was \"struck from behind at high speed,\" his spokesperson said.",
      "\"There is no American more deserving of this honor,\" Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman said in a social media post. \"Mayor Rudy Giuliani took down the Mafia, saved New York City, comforted the nation following 9/11, and served in countless other ways to improve the lives of others. Thank you, President Trump, for honoring his life and legacy.\"",
      "Giuliani, 81, built his reputation in the 1980s and '90s in New York City as a prosecutor before being elected mayor. He was dubbed \"America's mayor\" after his leadership in New York after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.",
      "After serving two terms as mayor, he ran for president in 2008 but withdrew during the Republican primary after a third place finish in Florida. Later, he became a close adviser to Mr. Trump in his first term and was a key spreader of conspiracy theories and unfounded claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen after Mr. Trump's loss.",
      "Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C., and he declared bankruptcy after being found liable for $148 million for spreading falsehoods about Georgia election workers.",
      "The Presidential Medal of Freedom is \"presented to individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.\"",
      "The award was established by former President John F. Kennedy in 1963.",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: With President Trump looking to expand immigration and crime crackdowns in more U.S. cities, we will hear exclusively from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "Boosted by a drop in crime in the nation's capital following the deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to clean up D.C., the president sets his sights on another potential target, Chicago.",
      "We visited the Windy City and toured a neighborhood where the crime rate has dropped with the governor of Illinois, Democrat J.B. Pritzker.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): What they're saying they're trying to do is fight crime, but, actually, they're just trying to scare people.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Pritzker tells us Trump and Secretary Noem's mission is un- American.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: It's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2013 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops if they in fact do that.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Plus: the shakeup at the Centers for Disease Control. After the firing of the newly confirmed director, a group of top experts quit in protest. CBS medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder will tell us why this matters to public health.",
      "Then, World Food Programme executive director Cindy McCain joins us following a trip to Gaza, where her organization is working to feed hundreds of thousands threatened by famine.",
      "Finally, we will reflect on the passing of a Washington institution, legendary CBS News radio reporter Mark Knoller.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is off on this Labor Day weekend. I'm Ed O'Keefe.",
      "We begin today with Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, who's joining us from Florida.",
      "Madam Secretary, thanks for being with us.",
      "KRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): Absolutely, Ed. Thank you for inviting me.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. Well, we have a lot to discuss.",
      "And we want to start with this, because we've learned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning on expanding operations in the coming days to Chicago. When are those operations expected to start? And you said in recent days that you're using the recent deployments in Los Angeles as a model. What does that mean?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, we've already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we're upholding our laws.",
      "But we do intend to add more resources to those operations. I won't disclose the details because they are law enforcement and investigative folks that are on the ground there, and I want to make sure we keep their security our number one priority.",
      "But we will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do, focusing on those that are perpetuating murder and rape and trafficking of drugs and humans across our country, knowing that every single citizen deserves to be safe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Part of what distinguished the Los Angeles operations, however, is that National Guard troops were there, in essence, protecting or backing up those federal agents as they conducted operations.",
      "Is that what we should expect to see in Chicago?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You know, that always is a prerogative of President Trump and his decision. I won't speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities, but I do know that L.A. wouldn't be standing today if President Trump hadn't taken action.",
      "And that city would have burned down if left to the devices of the mayor and the governor of that state. And so the citizens who live there, the small business owners in downtown L.A., they're thankful that President Trump came in with federal law enforcement officers and helped support keeping those streets open, keep their homes and businesses from burning down, and made sure the law and order was restored.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I just want to clarify one thing you said there. You said L.A. wouldn't be standing if not for these federal deployments?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: So many of those homes and businesses that were in downtown L.A. and in those areas were dealing with riots and violence. And coming in and bringing those federal law enforcement officers in was incredibly important to keeping peace.",
      "And so we are grateful that President Trump was willing to send resources and people in, in order to enforce the law. And, Ed, since then, we have arrested 5,000 dangerous illegal criminals out of L.A. and removed them from our country and had them face justice for their crimes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, as you know, we spoke with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker about all this. And I asked him what he'd say to you about these forthcoming plans. Let's play that and let you respond after.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If she were to call you, what would you say? What's your message to her?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): Well, I tell her that what she's doing is inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused.",
      "We have people that have lived, yes, in the state of Illinois, in the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes. They're law-abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors. And why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear?",
      "Indeed, they're even disrupting the lives of people who are attempting to go through a legal process to stay in this country, who've been invited to a hearing, and then they're arresting them in the hallways on their way to that hearing.",
      "So this is dangerous. They shouldn't be doing it. It's anti-American. It's un-American. And I would tell her to maybe check herself for, what does she really believe?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: She's also critical the fact that Chicago is one of the cities that doesn't cooperate with federal immigration operations, and she was quoted as saying that Illinois \u2013 quote \u2013 \"refuses to have our back.\"",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, that's not true. In fact, there were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the ICE officials that were here.",
      "People have a right to express themselves. People have a right to their First Amendment, you know, freedom to express. And we protect that too in the city of Chicago. So it's not true that the nobody has their backs.",
      "What we won't do, however, is engage in what is a federal effort. That is to say, they have their job, immigration. We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city. And, by the way, we're succeeding at that job. But when they bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Madam Secretary, your response?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, for 13 consecutive years, Chicago had more murders than any other American city. In fact, just last year, in 2024, they had three times the amount of murders that L.A. did, five times more than New York City.",
      "So he can talk about what a great job he's doing as governor, but he's failing those families who will no longer have their child with them, their mother or their father or their cousin, aunt, and uncle that are gone forever because of the violence that's happening in Chicago.",
      "So I was a governor for many years. So I recognize the responsibilities that you have on your shoulder when you're a governor. And I will tell you, as a governor, when I had to make tough decisions, and when I had disagreements with the Biden administration or challenges my people were facing, I called up the Biden administration.",
      "I went and talked to them. I asked for meetings. I fought for my people. This seems like it's more about Governor Pritzker's ego now, rather than actually protecting his people. If he has one murder in the city of Chicago, he should be calling President Trump and saying, what's your ideas? What can we do?",
      "They don't even honor our detainers in Chicago. They don't go out there and work with us to make sure we're bringing people to justice. And, instead, he goes on TV and he attacks me, when we're doing exactly what those people need, is, they need someone to help them get the dangerous criminals off their streets.",
      "And if he has one, two, five or 10, those victims and their families deserve to walk in freedom on those streets and not have to worry about what's going to happen to them on their way to their jobs.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Sure.",
      "Are you planning, beyond Chicago, to expand these kinds of operations to other cities? There have been reports, for example, that Boston may very well soon be next.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now.",
      "And so we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in. We've been working to partner with every single agency that we can. We have hundreds and hundreds of agreements with local law enforcement, sheriffs, city administrators that \u2013 and mayors across the country that want to solve problems.",
      "I would encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom, like the people of Washington, D.C. are now, and enjoying going out to eat at night and not having to worry if they're going to be a victim of a carjacking or a robbery, they should call us.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You mentioned there are a bunch of cities in Democratic- controlled states with Democratic mayors. And there have been a lot of questions asked about that focus.",
      "There are Republican cities with major crime issues as well, and we haven't heard about plans to deploy, say, to Dallas or to Oklahoma City, or to cities in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi that have considerable crime rates, in some cases higher, percentage-wise, than those other cities you mentioned.",
      "Are there plans to go to red states and Republican-controlled cities in this kind of way?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we've got operations that, again, I won't talk about details on, but we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we're doing with a political lens.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: One of the most-high profile examples of someone who's been rounded up by ICE in recent months is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and the fate of his situation is still up in the air.",
      "He's awaiting trial on human smuggling charges set for January in Tennessee, but your department is also working to get him deported to Uganda. If he broke the law in this country, as the administration alleges, shouldn't he be held here and face charges here, instead of being deported?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and \u2013 and Pam Bondi's department. So we will let them do that.",
      "Although this individual does have criminal charges pending, he has charges pending against him civilly as well. And the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn't walk free in the United States of America.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But I heard you say that we're going to let the Justice Department do that. Does this mean that \u2013 does that mean the push to deport him to Uganda is off?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Oh, we will still continue to pursue all options.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We will make sure that he's not released into this country. So, regardless of that, yes, absolutely.",
      "He's not an American citizen, and he shouldn't be here. And especially because of his dangerous criminal activities, we should ensure that we leave every avenue on the table.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Got it.",
      "So, among other things, you oversee FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as we hit the peak of hurricane season. And we're marking the 20th anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina this weekend 20 years ago. Is the federal government prepared to respond to a major disaster at this moment?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We are absolutely more prepared than the last administration and doing a much better job responding to the disasters we've already experienced since President Trump has been in the White House.",
      "We've had over a dozen, close to 20 different disasters throughout the country just since President Trump has been the president of the United States. And we have deployed resources twice as fast as FEMA ever has in the past, gotten people on the ground over 100 percent quicker than any other administration has.",
      "In fact, with the disasters that we saw that were so horrific and devastating in Texas and New Mexico, North Carolina, we've had people on the ground within hours responding to those families that were in crisis.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "I bring this up because part of what you're suggesting there is in dispute from a handful of current and former FEMA employees who wrote to Congress this past week raising concerns about the agency's ability to respond to forthcoming natural disasters.",
      "One of the specific concerns they have is this decision that now has you reviewing any cost of $100,000 or more that FEMA plans to make. Can you give me an example of a charge of $100,000 or more that you've rejected?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, absolutely.",
      "We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars to a one- woman firm to deliver to us 30 million meals, and she delivered only 50,000 to us. And it was a \u2013 one person that the state \u2013 federal government had contracted with in order to deliver 30 million. And I don't know how they ever expected one person to do that.",
      "We \u2013 we had a person that was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to book meetings\u2026",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 that \u2013 of less than 10 to 15 people, and with no meetings that we saw that were productive or couldn't be done by sending an e-mail.",
      "Over and over again, we're looking at these contracts and looking at the fact that, are they duplicative, are they just supporting woke ideologies, DEI, or are they actually delivering disaster response, which is what FEMA job is, is to put in place operations to support states and local governments to take care of people.",
      "And so that evaluation has saved us hundreds of millions of dollars within FEMA. And within the Department of Homeland Security, it has saved us $13 billion already. And we're going to consider \u2013 continue to make sure that we're accountable to taxpayers.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: At least 20 of the people who signed this letter were current FEMA employees, and they've been placed on administrative leave.",
      "And I had heard you in previous interviews suggest that those that are making accusations against the agency should put their names on the criticisms of the allegations. So, now they have, and they've been placed on administrative leave.",
      "And I'm curious if it's now the policy of DHS that any time an employee puts their name on something, publicly criticizes you or the president's leadership, that they should anticipate being put on leave or fired.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: This \u2013 this letter was signed by many people anonymously. There was some who had their names on there.",
      "And those who had their names on there were temporary contract employees who had worked for the Department of Homeland Security for less than a year, individuals who are not long-term FEMA employees, who \u2013 who grab ahold of the mission to be there, to go and serve individuals and to \u2013 are deployed across the country, and have for years to make sure they're responsive to families in their time of need.",
      "So, absolutely, every employee will be evaluated as to if they're doing their job and if they're doing it appropriately.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joining us this Sunday from Florida, thank you so much. Lots to discuss. We appreciate it.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Thank you, Ed. Appreciate it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Face the Nation is back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: On Friday, we traveled to Chicago and sat down with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. He invited us there in advance of the expanded federal presence Secretary Noem was just talking about.",
      "Here's what he told us.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): We hope that they don't send any troops along with ICE. And, if they do, they'll be in court pretty quickly, because that is illegal. Posse Comitatus does not allow U.S. troops into U.S. cities to do \u2013 you know, to fight crime, to be involved in law enforcement. That's not their job.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If they're doing federal immigration work, a judge might say, if they're protecting those federal agents, that's OK. I mean, you'll just fight that in court as long as you can?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, National Guard troops, any kind of troops on the streets of an American city don't belong, unless there is an insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency. There is not.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Have you been briefed by anyone in the administration about these plans?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: No one in the administration, the president, or anybody under him, has called anyone in my administration or \u2013 and me \u2013 have not called the city of Chicago or anyone else.",
      "So it's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2013 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that. The other thing is, you know, they ought to be coordinating with local law enforcement. They ought to let us know when they're coming, where they're coming, if it's ICE or if it's ATF or whoever it is.",
      "But they don't want to do that either. And I must say, it's disruptive. It's dangerous. It tends to inflame passions on the ground when they don't let us know what their plans are and when we can't coordinate with them.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: The president has had some things to say about the Windy City several times in recent days.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Next should be Chicago, because, as you all know, Chicago is a killing field right now.",
      "Everybody knows Chicago is a hellhole right now. Everybody knows it.",
      "(End VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: You know, he wakes up in the morning and whatever whim strikes him is what he apparently says.",
      "And recently, I guess I have been living rent-free in his head. Chicago apparently is living rent-free in his head, even though, on other days he'll talk about Baltimore, he'll talk about New York. Notice he never talks about where the most violent crime is occurring, which is in red states.",
      "Illinois is not even in the bottom half of states in terms of violent crime. But do you hear him talking about Florida, where he is now from? No, you don't hear him talking about that, or Texas. Their violent crime rates are much worse in other places. And we're very proud of the work that we've done. And we want more help.",
      "You know what kind of help we want? Civilian law enforcement help. We would like ATF agents to help us take more guns off the streets. We would like FBI, again, to coordinate with our local law enforcement to help catch perpetrators of crimes. If they would do that, we would welcome that.",
      "But that's not what they're planning to do.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, bottom line, would more federal agents in Chicago, assisting local law enforcement help deter crime right now?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Of course. You want to help us catch bad guys? Help \u2013 bring the FBI. Bring the ATF. We already coordinate with them, by the way. We do a lot of work with them.",
      "We do some \u2013 we do drug interdiction, we do fighting gangs, and we do, you know, interdiction of guns at the borders.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Part of the reason I ask about the potential for federal deployments to help right now is that, according to a CBS News data analysis of what's gone on in Washington just in the last few weeks, well, crime there as well was down, and in most cases down double digits.",
      "It's down nearly 50 percent in the three weeks since the National Guard moved in, assaults down 41 percent, homicides down 69 percent, robbery down 63 percent, and the mayor concedes carjacking, which had become a bigger problem, down 83 percent since the federal agents showed up.",
      "So this kind of deployment he's set up in Washington that he says he wants to do in other cities, at least in Washington, is showing potential success. And what I hear you saying is, well, sure, if they show up, it might help us too?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: I'm saying we don't want troops on the streets of American cities.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: That's un-American. And, frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better. This one doesn't seem to. He hasn't read any books. He doesn't seem to understand the Constitution or the laws.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But if he just sends the FBI, the ATF, DEA\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: They're \u2013 yes, they're here already.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: \u2026 and sends more of them?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: We have some working with us now. Would love more help.",
      "You know what else he's doing? He's cutting funds that help us to fight violent crime from the federal government.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Give me an example of how those cuts have affected the ability to fight crime in Chicago.",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: So, let me just tell you what happened in Illinois when we had a Republican governor and he cut funding for programs that helped prevent crime.",
      "What happened was we, saw a significant increase in crime. Donald Trump is now doing the same thing. He's taking away federal funding for those programs which are so important to us. We've increased funding at the state level, but we need that federal funding. It's on top of that.",
      "One more thing. The business community in the city of Chicago got together and put $100 million forward to help us, back in 2022, to help us to fight crime through these prevention programs. It's working. Crime is down.",
      "I mean, murders are down 50 percent in the city of Chicago. And you can go through every statistic. Almost everything is much better as a result of that work. Donald Trump is trying to take that money away. And he isn't listening to the business community here. He isn't listening to the clergy here. He isn't listening to people on the ground, Republicans here who understand that putting troops on the city of Chicago's streets is going to cause more problems than he understands.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What do you think it's going to do to the country if that happens? Deploying in Washington, where he has federal control, is one thing, but if he sends military forces into a major American city in a state that didn't ask for it, beyond Los Angeles, what do Americans make of that?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, they should understand that he has other aims other than fighting crime. That's the first thing they should understand.",
      "The second is, it's an attack on the American people by the president of the United States. Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him, but should he be sending troops in? No.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You said he has other aims. What are the other aims?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: The other aims are that he'd like to stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.",

      "ED O'KEEFE: We're joined now by Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and the editor at large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Doctor, so great to see you. Thanks for coming to Washington for this important conversation because it's been a pretty chaotic week at the CDC, to say the least. We've seen the ouster of the head of the agency, who'd only been confirmed by the Senate this summer. She's now mounting a legal challenge to that. Other top officials also departed. They're still reeling from a shooting at the headquarters in Atlanta a few weeks ago.",
      "What are these departures so important to take note of, and how do they affect you, me and everybody else in terms of health and \u2013 and medicine?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: I think it's really important to understand that this is not just palace intrigue. This really does affect all of us. So, not just the director, but the people in charge of respiratory infections, vaccine safety, the chief medical officer, the person who is in charge of public health data also resigned earlier this week. So, these are really key positions, not to mention that a lot of the directors of the different centers, because it's centers, plural, have also been forced out over the last several months. So, you're really dealing with a leadership vacuum at the CDC. So, this is not business as usual.",
      "And so, specifically, how does this affect you and me, folks watching at home? So, first of all, vaccine policy. Vaccine policy is now being made by political fiat and communicated through social media, rather than a transparent, open, scientific review process. And so, we're seeing the reversal of previous recommendations, which will also confuse whether insurance will cover certain vaccines for certain people. And it's already sowing tremendous confusion at pharmacies, as well as doctors' offices.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, there is a series of meetings coming up regarding the future of vaccines, and how they're going to be available, who gets them. Tell us about that and \u2013 and the concerns that some of these now former CDC officials had about what might happen at those meetings.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, so what \u2013 these meetings are scheduled for mid- September. Some of the things on the agenda include the newborn Hepatitis B dose. We typically give it to newborns because that's to prevent transmission from the mother to the baby, so it's one of the most common ways that Hepatitis B is transmitted.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: One of the first shots a baby gets.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: One of the first shots it gets, for good reason. Also protection for infants from RSV, one of the most common causes of hospitalization among infants. Number three, the Covid shot. And we expect to see a tightening of availability, eligibility of Covid shots, especially for healthy kids and adults.",
      "And then finally, the combined measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and revisiting long-standing childhood vaccine recommendations would really be unprecedented here.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, it's basically every shot you get, from like zero to 18, is now up for debate. And then the Covid shot, of course, which is an important one for many people, on a regular rolling basis?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, some really basic things that we have counted on for a very long time. Some of the core concerns with the process involves cherry picking of data, scientific reviews being altered or pulled, and unvetted studies being rushed into the process, into policymaking. And this is really an inversion of radical transparency.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. There was a \u2013 there's an example in recent days because there is \u2013 we're starting \u2013 you know, fall's coming, Covid picks up. We've already seen one example of a school in Kansas City that was forced to shut down temporarily due to Covid. And there have been spikes in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, especially. What do people at home need to know as the fall approaches and Covid starts to spike?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Well, I think, first of all, vaccinations are for many different purposes. So, it's to prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death. But for a lot of people, you may not be able to call in sick from work very easily. Like for us, it's really hard to take time off, even if you really are sick. You might want to keep your kids in school. And so the best way to keep yourself at work or your kids in school is for them to get vaccinated so you and they are not getting sick.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Let's \u2013 and we should point out, by the way, that school closed. Set to open again on Tuesday. But the fact that they had to close at all, right, as the school year's begins, is a sign potentially of things to come if people don't get their shots.",
      "Let's bottom line this. I'm a 42-year-old guy with asthma. Am I going to have issues getting my Covid shot?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: You will not because even though you're under 65 \u2013 so, the recommendations or the FDA approval is for people 65 and older, they are all good. They can get their Covid shot.",
      "Under 65, if you have at least one risk factor for severe Covid, you can also get your Covid shot. So, you can absolutely \u2013 that's not an issue for you, Ed.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But it's, you know, kids under 18, they're perfectly healthy, spouse, aging parents, it's up in the air.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, so aging parents over 65, they \u2013 they're eligible. But say you're between six months and 64 years of age, and you do not have a risk factor for severe Covid, that is the group where we really have a lot of uncertainty. Now, I should point out, pregnancy is a risk factor for severe Covid. So, your healthy wife, let's say she were pregnant, which I don't think she is.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Nope.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: But if she were, she would be eligible for a Covid shot.",

      "And I'll tell you a quick anecdote and that kind of illustrate this.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Sure.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: So, there was a surprise birthday party a few days ago for one of the president's top advisers, Stephen Miller. And he was entertaining this crowd, which included a bunch of cabinet secretaries and House Speaker Mike Johnson and other VIPs. And he was explaining about how, back in the day, when he and Mike Johnson were just, you know, essentially nobodies, he would run his ideas by Mike Johnson and he \u2013 even though Stephen thought they were crazy even himself, Mike Johnson said that they were good ideas. And Stephen said, some of the stuff we're trying now is untested.",
      "But it just really illustrated how this president and his closest advisors are willing to do whatever it takes to try to push out people that they think are at cross purposes to their agenda, and that includes people at these quasi-independent agencies, whether it's the bureaucracy that they inherited or whether it's people that the president personally interviewed and selected, like the CDC director.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE (Capitol Bureau Chief And Senior Washington Correspondent, \"Politico\": You know, when Donald Trump talked on the campaign trail about draining the swamp, I mean he's been talking about this for 10 years, I don't think a lot of people, you know, thought he was talking about health officials, about scientist, about people who work in national security. But, obviously, he is taking it, his sort of, you know, mantra to that point right now.",
      "And I mean we have to \u2013 we have to acknowledge that a lot of people have said, Donald Trump doesn't have this authority when it came to DOGE and getting rid of a lot of federal workers, folks said, look, they have a lot of protections. You can't do that.",
      "Well, the courts, a lot of them, have sided with him. And so, he's taking it to the next step here. And, you know, there's a lot of questions about whether he can do it. But obviously, he's going to try. And he's succeeded a lot in the courts, where a lot of people thought he would not.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But with Congress coming back, what are they going to do about it?",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Well \u2013",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Nothing.",

      "KAREN TUMULTY: Basically nothing. And this is not only \u2013 it's \u2013 it's not only a war on expertise, but the \u2013 in the early phases it was all about going after the so-called deep state government employees, the bureaucracy. Now they've begun to oust their own people, their own appointees.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And as you write today, most of the conservative movement kind of hangs back, stays quiet about it, and lets it happen.",

      "RACHAEL BADE: Uh-huh.",

      "RACHAEL BADE: Look, I think you're going to see Republicans lean into it. I mean, obviously, this is an initiative that Donald Trump himself has been pushing. I don't think if you ask lawmakers, specifically Republican lawmakers in July if they were going to be focused on a big crime bill in September, I don't think anyone would have told you that that would be the case.",
      "But Donald Trump has been very successful in terms of changing the narrative. I mean when you think about lawmakers leaving town at the end of July, everyone was focused on Epstein and how the president couldn't shake the narrative. Now they're coming back and the full focus of Washington is on crime. And this is an issue, as I have written in my column, that very much benefits Republicans. I mean there are polls that show a lot of the nation doesn't like what he's doing with the National Guard.",

      "RACHAEL BADE: But when it comes to people's approval rating of Trump and crime, he's at something like 54 percent according to a recent AP poll.",

      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, of course.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: The word he used this week was \"trap.\" That Democrats are walking into a trap. And, in fact, crime is an issue that has always been problematic for Democrats \u2013",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Because they are sort of caught between not wanting to look soft on public safety, but also protecting civil rights, which are one of their core values.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Which is what I thought made the governor's answer interesting, where he said, yes, you're right, I'm not helping the federal government with immigration because we're worried about crime and public safety at the state and local level, and they'll do the immigration. And his ability to split those two, I felt, was a little cleaner than many other Democratic governors and mayors have been when they realize they're dealing with this hot potato.",

      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, I thought his \u2013 his response about bringing in ATF \u2013 ATF officials and FBI officials helping with crime there, that showed me that Democrats are starting to maybe read the political tea leaves here and come up with smarter answers, because when Trump first started talking about this, the response was, we don't need the National Guard. Crime is down. Look at the stats. But the reality is, people don't feel it.",

      "JENNIFER JACOBS: On the politics of it, Trump people don't just want to win issues, they want to systematically work their opposition into a corner and crack their coalition.

      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. You are \u2013 I like to call you \"scoop,\" at least around these parts. And you had another big one this week regarding the future of Iowa's Republican Senator Joni Ernst. She's announcing, in the coming days, that she's not running for re-election. It had been talked about, thought it might happen. She had also made a two-term vow, and so we're nearing that. Why'd she do it? And is it indicative of a problem for the party in Iowa or for congressional Republicans writ large that someone like her would walk away?",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: I think we're going to have to wait from her on \u2013 on why she did it. It will be very interesting when she makes her \u2013 her statement this week if it does indeed come.",

      "ED O'KEEFE: In North Carolina, yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: And \u2013 and what this shows us is that there's very little room for discontent or for pushback in, you know, Trump's second term. I mean, Ernst ended up voting for Pete Hegseth, yes, but there was a time where she was potentially not going to \u2013 she got pummeled. I mean I'm talking death threats. I mean it was ugly. And my understanding is that she has told people that that really soured her on politics.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",

      "ED O'KEEFE: I will say, we were at the Iowa State Fair a few weeks ago, and I was struck how many people stopped me to say, I'm not happy with what he's doing, the president, or I've got issues with the governor, or I've got issues with Senator Ernst. I had not been approached that way by \u2013 by Iowans in recent years, and this suggests something could be there.",

      "ED O'KEEFE: And yet Israel has declared Gaza City a combat zone and is ending humanitarian pauses and ramping up airstrikes around the city. Gaza, of course, is one of the areas where a global monitor has confirmed famine. You talk about the hunger you saw in and around that region. What will a more aggressive military offensive in that area mean for Gaza City?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, it's \u2013 it's going to limit the amount of food that they have access to. Of course, the danger alone is a whole other part of that, as you know. And it does not make it easy for humanitarian aid workers to get in there as well to make sure that we can do our job.",
      "The one thing that I've been saying all along about situations like Gaza City and others is that humanitarian aid workers are not targets. They're not targets. And this has to end. So, I'm \u2013 I'm hoping that perhaps it won't be as bad as we think it's going to be, but I have a feeling \u2013 I have a feeling we're going to see some \u2013 some more serious devastation.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: In fact, you bring up the issue of safety for humanitarian workers. Last year among the deadliest on record, nearly 400 killed in the line of duty. There was a World Food Programme convoy that came under fire in Gaza last month. I mean, absent a ceasefire, what more needs to be done by warring parties to protect humanitarians as they try to carry out this work?",

What we need is full, unfettered access at scale to be able to get in and feed, and feed in a way where the panic subsides. They're \u2013 they're \u2013 and for \u2013 and, secondly, of course, we don't do anything that involves guns or \u2013 or military in any way, shape or form. And that's on purpose. That's who we are. That's our mandate. And so, we \u2013 obviously, a ceasefire, as I said before, being able to get in at scale, unfettered, and in a safe manner, and continuously get in, and get in to the furthest sites where \u2013 where we can't get food into \u2013 into the most vulnerable people that are \u2013 that are at risk right now.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: As part of your trip to the region, you also met with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. You describe it as a productive meeting and said you discussed what you need in order to be able to get access. But you've also said it was clear there isn't enough food getting into Gaza.",
      "And I want to read you something that the prime minister's office posted on social media. They said, in part, \"it's regrettable that Mrs. McCain has since issued statements contradicting what she told us in Jerusalem. That is a misrepresentation. Israel is enabling a steady flow of aid in sufficient quantities.\"",
      "What's your response to the prime minister?",

      "We have, in recent weeks, been able to get a little more food in. So, that's an accurate statement. But it's not enough. It simply isn't enough to be able to do \u2013 to do the job and stop malnutrition, starvation and all the things that have occurred as a result of it.",

So, it involves more than just the food trucks, although that's very important, but it also involves things \u2013 special feeding for children, as well as medicine and water that need to all get in.",

    "summary": "Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, stepped down hours after the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
    "story": [
      "Four senior officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced their resignations in recent days, citing what they described as growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines.",
      "Two of those \u2014 Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2014 stepped down on Wednesday, hours after the White House announced the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
      "Monarez, confirmed by the Senate in late July, was removed less than a month into her tenure. White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monarez \"was not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again.\" Monarez's attorneys argue the dismissal is unlawful, asserting that only the president can remove a Senate-confirmed director.",
      "On Thursday, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill was chosen to serve as acting CDC director, several White House officials confirmed to CBS News. And in an internal email sent to CDC staff Thursday evening, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed O'Neill as the acting CDC director, but did not address Monarez's departure.",
      "\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC,\" Kennedy told CDC employees, later writing that \"President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: Strengthen the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats.\"",
      "Houry and Daskalakis said they had become increasingly uneasy about how vaccine policy was being handled. Both pointed to preparations for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, which recommends vaccine schedules.",
      "Houry said they feared \"some decisions had been made before there was even the data or the science to support those. We are scientists, and that was concerning to us.\"",
      "Daskalakis added that he was \"very concerned that there's going to be an attempt to re-litigate vaccines that have already had clear recommendations with science that has been vetted,\" which he warned could undermine public trust. \"If you can't attack access, then why not attack trust? And that's what I think the playbook is,\" he said.",
      "Both officials cited instances in which evidence reviews were altered or withdrawn. A CDC analysis of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative, was briefly posted before being taken down at HHS's direction. \"If there's something that doesn't line up with the recommendations, then that information will be taken down, and it's not there for the public to see for openness and transparency,\" Houry said.",
      "The two also criticized what they described as a lack of direct communication between CDC scientists and HHS leadership. Daskalakis said his team was never invited to brief Kennedy on topics ranging from measles to COVID.",
      "When asked about Kennedy's calls for \"radical transparency,\" Houry and Daskalakis described learning about changes to the COVID vaccine schedule for children not through internal channels but via social media.",
      "\"The radical transparency manifested itself by a Twitter post, which is how Dr. Houry and I learned that the secretary had mandated the change in the children's vaccine schedule for COVID,\" Daskalakis recalled. \"What is the background that led to that decision? And we were denied access to that information. So, I don't think that that's radically transparent,\" Daskalakis said.",
      "CBS News reached out to HHS for comment on some of the allegations made by Houry and Daskalakis, but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Both officials said they had no jobs lined up when they resigned. Houry described the decision as an effort to raise the alarm about the direction of the agency.",
      "\"For us, this was really sending out a bat signal,\" Houry said. \"We were the very senior scientists and career leaders at CDC. We thought this was the time to stand together and try to do what we could to raise the alarm around public health in our country.\"",
      "Daskalakis said remaining at CDC under current conditions would have made them complicit in what he called the \"weaponization\" of public health.",
      "\"The safety has already been compromised\u2026We are flying blind in the U.S. already. If we continued\u2026we would be complicit and would be facilitating the ability to go from flying blind to actively harming people,\" he said.",
      "Houry emphasized the severity of the moment by noting that she left without a backup plan.",
      "\"My leaving without a job was really just showing how dire the circumstances had become,\" Houry said.",
      "Daskalakis said his decision was also shaped by his medical oath.",
      "\"As a physician, I take the Hippocratic oath: first, do no harm. I am seeing ideology permeating science in a way that is going to harm children and adults\u2026I think we are seeing things that are happening that are making our country less prepared to be able to respond to the everyday pathogens \u2026but also \u2026 to the next big thing.\"",
      "Both also expressed concerns for their personal safety in the current climate.",
      "\"The environment we live in\u2026 stoked by misinformation, especially from people considered by some to be health authorities, makes me worried for all of us in public health,\" Daskalakis said. \"I am concerned, but that's part of our job\u2026to be brave and continue to speak the truth even when we are outside of the CDC.\"",
      "The resignations came weeks after a shooting outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, which law enforcement linked to COVID misinformation.",
      "Houry said the White House response to the shooting was muted. Kennedy toured the site but later gave an interview expressing distrust of experts. \"That was after the attack. It was based on COVID misinformation. So this is when we were trying to build trust,\" she said.",
      "Daskalakis added that while Kennedy later described mass shootings as a public health crisis, he believed the secretary should address misinformation as a root cause. \"The misinformation about the COVID vaccine that has been documented by the Georgia bureau of investigation as the reason for the shooter at CDC. I would really recommend that the secretary actually do take his own advice and actually address the core problem that led to that shooting as well,\" he said. He also noted that CDC's own gun violence prevention programs had been sharply reduced. \"We talk about violence as a public health problem. It is, and there's things we can do to prevent it. Unfortunately, the majority of that program, the staff are terminated.\"",
      "The firings and resignations have sparked calls for oversight. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a bipartisan investigation, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington urged Kennedy's removal, and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 who voted to confirm Kennedy's appointment as HHS secretary \u2014 said the developments would \"require oversight.\"",
      "The events come as the Food and Drug Administration narrowed eligibility for updated COVID-19 vaccines to older adults and people with risk factors for severe COVID.",

      "Spicomellus, which roamed the Earth 165 million years ago, is the world's oldest ankylosaur, a herbivorous group of dinosaurs known for their tank-like bodies.",
      "Palaeontologists' image of Spicomellus was based on a single rib bone found in Morocco in 2019.",
      "But newly discovered remains have helped scientists form a clearer picture of the unusual dinosaur.",
      "The fossils showed it had bony spikes fused onto all of its ribs \u2014 something never seen before in any other vertebrate species living or extinct, according to the research published Wednesday.",

      "These dinosaurs survived late into the time dinosaurs were on Earth, in a period known as the Cretaceous, the BBC reported.

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is replacing entry-level workers whose jobs can be performed by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, a rigorous new study finds.",
      "Early-career employees in fields that are most exposed to AI have experienced a 13% drop in employment since 2022, compared to more experienced workers in the same fields and when measured against people in sectors less buffeted by the fast-emerging technology, according to a recent\u00a0working paper from Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen.",
      "The study adds to the growing body of research suggesting that the spread of generative AI in the workplace is likely to disrupt the job market, especially for younger workers, the report's authors said.",
      "\"These large language models are trained on books, articles and written material found on the internet and elsewhere,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's the kind of book learning that a lot of people get at universities before they enter the job market, so there is a lot of overlap with between these LLMs and the knowledge young people have.\"",
      "The research highlights two fields in particular where AI already appears to be supplanting a significant number of young workers: software engineering and customer service. Between late 2022 and July 2025, entry-level employment in those areas declined by roughly 20%, according to the report, while employment for older workers in the same jobs grew.",
      "Overall, employment for workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed sectors dropped 6% during the study period. By comparison, employment in those areas rose between 6% and 9% for older workers, according to the researchers.",

      "Older employees, who generally have navigated the workplace for a longer period of time, are more likely to have picked up the kinds of communication and other \"soft\" skills that are harder to teach and that employers may be reluctant to replace with AI, the data suggests.",
      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",
      "For example, in fields like nursing AI is more likely to augment human workers by taking over rote tasks, freeing health care practitioners to spend more time focusing on patients, according to proponents of the technology.",
      "While entry-level employment has fallen in professions that are most exposed to AI, no such such decline has occurred in jobs where employers are looking to use these tools to support and expand what employees do.",
      "\"Workers who are using these tools to augment their work are benefiting,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"So there's a rearrangement of the kind of employment in the economy.\"",
      "Advice for young workers",
      "As of late last year, 23% of employees were using generative AI in their jobs at least once per week, according to a\u00a0report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Workers who can learn to use AI to to help them do their jobs better will be best positioned for success in today's labor market, according to Brynolfsson.",
      "A recent report from AI staffing firm Burtch Works found that starting salaries for entry-level AI workers rose by 12% from 2024 to 2025.",
      "\"Young workers who learn how to use AI effectively can be much more productive. But if you are just doing things that AI can already do for you, you won't have as much value-add,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"This is the first time we're getting clearer evidence of these kinds of employment effects, but it's probably not the last time,\" he added. \"It's something we need to pay increasing attention to as it evolves and companies learn to take advantage of things that are out there.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
      "But a handful of other GOP priorities \u2014 from cracking down on crime to fast-tracking President Trump's nominees \u2014 have surfaced in recent weeks, along with lingering tensions and partisan disagreements, promising a chaotic return to Washington, and a lengthy to-do list.",
      "Here's what's on lawmakers' agenda as Congress returns:",
      "Government funding fight",
      "A familiar deadline is fast approaching, as Congress must race to keep the government funded by Sept. 30.",
      "While the House and Senate each passed a small number of funding bills before leaving Washington for the August recess, the two chambers have been on different pages when it comes to funding levels. Getting all 12 individual appropriations bills through both chambers is unlikely, meaning lawmakers will almost certainly have to rely on a short-term measure to keep the government funded.",
      "The dynamic isn't unusual. Congress regularly struggles to approve the new funding before the end of the fiscal year, opting instead to push the deadline down the road by keeping the government funded at current levels on a temporary basis. But this time around, the funding fight itself has taken on new meaning.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer came under intense scrutiny from his own party during the last funding fight in March. After pledging to fight the GOP plan, which increased defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels, he changed course at the eleventh hour. Ultimately, Schumer opted to deliver one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown, arguing that a shutdown risked more damage.",
      "This time around, Democratic leaders have worked to engage on the funding issue well ahead of the deadline. Early last month, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a \"Big Four\" meeting with their GOP counterparts to discuss funding the government. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Democrats said that \"it is clear that the Trump Administration and many within your party are preparing to 'go it alone' and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis.\"",
      "Still, the letter didn't appear to kickstart a bipartisan effort. And Mr. Trump, asked about meeting with the Democratic leaders last month, said he would do it, while saying it's \"almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything.\" The Democrats renewed their call for a meeting between congressional leaders last week, writing that the \"government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way. That is the only viable path forward.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have bemoaned the White House's efforts to claw back funds already appropriated in what's known as a rescissions package earlier this year, along with a new push by the administration last week to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress already approved. The rarely used maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, is an attempt to rescind funding unilaterally, sparking pushback on Capitol Hill and bipartisan criticism as an \"unlawful\" move.",
      "\"Today's announcement of the Administration's plan to advance an unlawful 'pocket rescission' package is further proof President Trump and Congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and 'going it alone' this fall,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "The dynamics put the parties on a collision course heading toward the Sept. 30 deadline.",
      "While Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, they will need 60 votes in the Senate to keep the government funded, meaning they will need the support of at least seven Democrats.",
      "At the same time, some in the party, including Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, have encouraged Democrats to let the government shut down to protest Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "\"We cannot be the only one playing by the rules with a hand tied behind our backs,\" Martin said. \"That old playbook, the norms that, you know, used to have guardrails on our democracy and protect all of us in this country \u2014 that doesn't exist anymore. We've got to throw that playbook out the window because the Republicans have.\"",
      "Changes to Senate nomination rules",
      "Senators left Washington after a bruising nominations saga in July. Democrats have slow-walked Mr. Trump's nominees in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay confirmations nearly across the board. Senate Democrats were unable to come to an agreement with the White House in an episode that foreshadowed a larger fight to come.",
      "\"Donald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names \u2014 but he got nothing. And he walked away with his tail between his legs,\" Schumer told reporters before leaving for the August recess.",
      "Schumer has railed against the White House for walking away from a deal involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Meanwhile, the president called the Democrat's demands \"egregious and unprecedented.\"",
      "Without a deal, Senate Republicans are expected to pursue changes to the nominations process that would allow them to more swiftly confirm the president's nominees upon their return.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, urged in an op-ed last week that it's \"time to change Senate confirmation rules\" amid what he described as a \"bitter fight\" over even routine nominations. He said that the Senate GOP is \"considering changes to the Senate rules to end the most egregious delay tactics.\"",
      "\"Senate Republicans are determined to confirm Mr. Trump's qualified nominees one way or another,\" Barrasso wrote.",
      "What the changes look like remains to be seen. Both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process in recent years, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Confirming Trump's nominees for BLS chair and Fed governor",
      "The possible changes to the confirmation process come as a handful of new high-profile nominees are expected to come before the Senate, in addition to the dozens already awaiting votes.",
      "Mr. Trump fired the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last month over a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. He soon announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the agency. Mr. Trump said in his announcement that Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "But the nominee could face pushback in the Senate, with questions about his experience and comments he's made suggesting the monthly jobs report should be suspended.",
      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is planning to hold a confirmation hearing for Antoni pending completed paperwork, according to a committee spokesperson. The panel includes a handful of Senate Republicans who have pushed back on some of Mr. Trump's most controversial nominees this year: Sen. Bill Cassidy of Tennessee, the committee chairman, along with Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Democrats on the committee demanded that the panel hold a full hearing on Antoni's nomination. And Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called Antoni \"an unqualified right-wing extremist who won't think twice about manipulating BLS data.\"",
      "The Senate is also expected to work to confirm Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump announced the nomination in August after Adriana Kugler stepped down. The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a confirmation hearing this week. But Democrats on the committee have called for a delay, seeking instead to hold an oversight hearing on Mr. Trump's moves to fire another member of the Fed board.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said he had fired another member of the Fed board, Lisa Cook, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Governors can only be fired \"for cause\" and Cook has refused to resign. She sued the president to block her firing last week.",
      "The push to oust Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could also tee up another Senate confirmation process. The upper chamber confirmed Monarez for the post in late July, though she had been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "Trump seeks crime bill, extension of DC police takeover",
      "Mr. Trump has moved to crack down on crime in the nation's capital by federalizing the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. He signaled in recent weeks that he plans to ask Congress to approve \"long-term extensions\" to maintain control of D.C.'s police, along with other measures to address crime.",
      "In an Aug. 11 executive order, Mr. Trump directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of D.C. police for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act,\" which the president can extend for up to 30 days. Any extension beyond that requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate. That could run into trouble in the Senate, where the Republican majority would need the support of at least seven Democrats to move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump also indicated last month that he plans to seek around $2 billion from Congress to renovate the streets of Washington. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said the White House was working on a package \"to improve the safety and quality of life in our nation's capital\" which he and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama would spearhead.",
      "\"He wants $2.5 billion, I'm going to try to find him the money, to repave the roads, take the graffiti off the building, refurbish the parts and give homeless people some place to go other than a tent on the side of the road,\" Graham said at an event in South Carolina last month.",
      "Mr. Trump has suggested that his crackdown on crime in D.C. could soon extend to other major cities, though he has unique authority in the nation's capital because the district is ultimately controlled by the federal government. Last week, the president wrote in a post on Truth Social about a crime bill, saying he's working with GOP leaders in Congress on the measure, though the details remained unclear.",
      "\"Speaker Mike Johnson, and Leader John Thune, are working with me, and other Republicans, on a Comprehensive Crime Bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's what our Country need, and NOW! More to follow.\"",
      "Push for Epstein files",
      "Lawmakers were on recess for weeks, but the calls for access to files in the case of late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein haven't gone away.",
      "Controversy has swirled around the Epstein files since the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking, died in federal custody in 2019. But renewed interest in the files has prompted members of both parties to call for more transparency, while dividing Mr. Trump's base.",
      "As House Democrats and some Republicans pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the Epstein files in late July, Johnson opted to send the House home early. But some lawmakers are still pressing ahead.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July to compel the Justice Department to release the files within 30 days, with plans to force a vote on the measure once lawmakers return from recess. Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol Wednesday alongside survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "The expected moves in Congress come after the administration late last month released transcripts of a two-day interview with Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, that was conducted in Florida in July. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice sent some of the files related to Epstein to the House Oversight Committee, which plans to make the records public after redactions have been made.",

      "Washington \u2014 Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention penned an op-ed Monday condemning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership in the aftermath of the firing of the CDC director last week, claiming he is \"endangering every American's health.\"",
      "\"What the health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has done to the CDC and to our nation's public health system over the past several months \u2014 culminating in his decision to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as CDC director days ago \u2014 is unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency and unlike anything our country had ever experienced,\" the nine former directors and acting directors wrote in the op-ed in The New York Times.",
      "The Trump administration attempted to oust CDC Director Susan Monarez last week, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her firing. Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials have resigned in recent days, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "In their op-ed, the former CDC directors who served under both Democrat and Republican administrations, pointed to a number of decisions by Kennedy that they say are \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" including canceling investments into medical research and the move to replace members on a key vaccine advisory committee, among other things.",
      "\"Firing Dr. Monarez \u2014 which led to the resignations of top CDC officials \u2014 adds considerable fuel to this raging fire,\" the former CDC directors added.",
      "The CDC leaders said they \"applaud Dr. Monarez for standing up for the agency and the health of our communities.\"",
      "\"The loss of Dr. Monarez and other top leaders will make it far more difficult for the CDC to do what it has done for about 80 years: work around the clock to protect Americans from threats to their lives and health,\" they wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, the former CDC directors also called on Congress to exercise its oversight authority over the department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is one of a number of agencies under the HHS umbrella.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on HHS last week\u00a0 to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for Sept. 18 amid the slew of CDC departures. And the Louisiana Republican, who delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's confirmation as secretary, also said the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "When Cassidy was asked Tuesday evening if he regretted his vote to confirm Kennedy, he said, \"This is about children's health.\"",
      "\"This is about how we protect the children of the United States of America,\" Cassidy continued. \"And there's allegations that that health is being endangered. I'm not presupposing anybody's right or wrong. We got to get to the bottom of it, and it'll take radical transparency. My colleagues agree with that.\"",
      "In an appearance on Fox News last week after the CDC director firing, Kennedy said he wouldn't comment on personnel, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to appear before the Senate Finance Committee Thursday to testify on President Trump's health care agenda.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, says the timing of the op-ed \"has everything to do with Dr. Monarez's firing last week,\" but she added that \"the concerns that they outlined are really about politics and ideology taking precedence over public health and science.\"",
      "Citing the firings of federal health workers across HHS, the weakening of public health programs, questions about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines amid a serious measles outbreak in Texas, among other things, Gounder said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" that \"we really are very concerned about how this is now diminishing trust in the very most basic of public health infrastructure in this country.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 19:34:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The judge rejected the Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding the request was a bridge too far.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google's search engine in a crackdown aimed at curbing the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \"answer engines\" as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google's long-held position as the internet's main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by generative artificial intelligence, or \"GenAI,\" have reshaped the judge's approach to remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.",
      "\"Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge's forte,\" Mehta wrote.",
      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google's search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine's secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \"would be incredibly messy and highly risky.\"",
      "\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" Google said in a statement provided to CBS News following the ruling. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\"",
      "\"We proved in court that competition had been frozen in place for two decades in internet search,\" Abigail Slater, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, wrote in a social media post. \"Google's tactics have excluded competition, harming consumers and slowing innovation. Today's remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal.\"",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It's also something that Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and the beneficiaries of the payments urged Mehta to maintain.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google's search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",

      "The surging value of World Liberty Financial, whose co-founders include Mr. Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, underscores the president's growing interest in cryptocurrency, a focus that spans both personal investments and policy moves during his presidency. Those efforts include\u00a0$TRUMP and $Melania meme coins, which are cryptos whose value is linked to internet trends and which began trading in January.",
      "What is WLFI?",
      "WLFI is a token, or a digital asset, that guarantees its holders the right to vote on governance issues for World Liberty Financial, according to the company.",
      "World Liberty Financial cautions token owners that WLFI isn't an investment, with its terms stating: \"You should not acquire $WLFI as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, for a financial purpose or with an expectation of resale for a profit or otherwise.\"",
      "The early swing in WLFI's price isn't unusual for tokens making their market debut, said Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, a provider of crypto and blockchain information.",
      "\"The price action from 40 cents to 21 cents is typical for new token launches,\" Puckrin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Early hype usually drives initial spikes, followed by a wave of selling as early entrants take profits.\"",
      "He added, \"Compared to other major token debuts, WLFI's decline is relatively moderate, and early backers have still seen strong returns from private sales.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial also offers a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Because stablecoins are linked to fixed assets, they are generally seen as less volatile to other cryptos.",
      "\"WLFI is carving out a unique position by offering token holders real governance rights over the direction of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin that is growing rapidly,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That's important because WLFI holders, through their governance votes, can help influence the future development and policies of USD1 and World Liberty Financial's policies, he added. That capacity \"sets it apart in a crowded market,\" he said.",
      "What about insider concentration risk?",
      "The Trump family and other insiders own more than 20% of the WLFI tokens, according to World Liberty Financial's site.",
      "But World Liberty Financial's terms note that no single digital wallet can exercise more than 5% of governance power, which should deter outsized insider influence, Puckrin said.",
      "What's happening with Mr. Trump's other crypto ventures?",
      "In May, the $TRUMP meme coin drew scrutiny when the venture offered its top holders the chance to join Mr. Trump for dinner. Investors spent about $140 million to snap up the coins and secure an invite to the event, data showed at the time.",
      "That sparked concerns from government watchdogs and some Democratic lawmakers that the Trump-branded asset was being linked to gain access to the president.",
      "As investors snapped up the meme coin, the asset's value almost doubled to about $15 in May. Since then, the coin has given up most of the gains and was trading at about $8.30 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 the owner of the Truth Social app \u2014 has expanded into crypto in recent months. In July, it bought about $2 billion in cryptocurrencies\u00a0to refashion the business as an investment firm.",

      "The 2026-2027 GoWild! pass is valid for 20 months and can be used immediately, marking the longest travel window since Frontier launched the program in 2022. Previously, the pass would have only been valid for trips beginning in May 2026, according to the airline.",
      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said. Frontier is expanding the pass as low-cost competitor Spirit struggles with its second bankruptcy in less than a year, while rival Southwest's new policies, like ending its\u00a0free checked bag policy, have alienated some customers.",
      "\"They see all other budget airlines really struggling, and there is market share for travelers who are in the market for budget airline flights,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They smell opportunity, and Frontier has always been good at expanding.\"",
      "What do passholders get?",
      "GoWild! passholders can book flights on domestic flights one day before departure, and 10 days ahead of an international flight's departure date. This year, for an additional fee, they can book flights earlier.",

      "The passes are non-transferrable, and are valid through the end of April 2027.",

    "summary": "GOP Rep. Thomas Massie took the first step in forcing a House vote to compel the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, filed a discharge petition\u00a0on Tuesday to attempt to force a House vote on compelling the release of files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, resurfacing the saga upon Congress' return.",
      "Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced\u00a0legislation\u00a0in July that would require the Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days. They planned to force a vote on the bill once lawmakers returned from their lengthy August recess.",
      "Although leadership controls the House's agenda and what legislation receives a vote, individual lawmakers can \"discharge\" legislation that has been sitting in committee. A discharge petition enables 218 members, a majority of the lower chamber, to provide their signatures and effectively bypass leadership to bring a bill before the full House for a vote.",
      "Khanna told NPR News on Tuesday that he's \"very confident\" all 212 Democrats will support the petition, along with more than the six Republicans needed to force a vote in the House.",
      "Before lawmakers left Washington, House Democrats and some Republicans had pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the files, but House Speaker Mike Johnson opted to send the House home early amid the pressure. As lawmakers returned to Washington on Tuesday, House Republican leadership added a bill to the House schedule for the week that would direct the House Oversight Committee to \"continue its ongoing investigation into the possible mismanagement of the Federal government's investigation of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell,\" Epstein's co-conspirator who is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "Massie criticized the move, calling it a \"meaningless vote to provide political cover for those members who don't support our bipartisan legislation to force the release of the Epstein files.\"",
      "Johnson told reporters in response that he would describe \"virtually everything Thomas Massie says related to this issue as meaningless.\" And the speaker defended how the administration and Congress have approached the documents so far, telling CBS News that \"there's been a lot of things that transpired over the August district work period.\"",
      "\"The Oversight Committee is well underway, the administration is complying. The Department of Justice complied with all the subpoenas they received and are processing 34,000 documents already,\" Johnson said. \"And we're going to move that along as quickly as possible so that all of this is pushed out to the public so the American people can make their own decisions.\"",
      "Epstein was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019 in what numerous investigations deemed a suicide. But the push to release the Epstein files reached a fever pitch, including among President Trump's base, after the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. And the development has prompted calls for more transparency from both sides of the aisle.",
      "Members of the House Oversight Committee are meeting with survivors of Epstein's abuse Tuesday. And Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol on Wednesday alongside survivors.",
      "The developments come after the Trump administration released transcripts of a two-day interview with Maxwell late last month. The Oversight Committee has also said it plans to make public records it received from the Justice Department related to Epstein after redactions have been made.",
      "Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, told Fox News on Sunday that \"we're going to make this information public \u2014 that's what the American people want,\" while noting that \"it's very complicated because there are victims of the Epstein files, and we want to listen to those victims and their families and their attorneys to see how best can we present this information.\"",

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department are facing blowback over their effort to block a lawsuit from members of the far-right Proud Boys, who are seeking financial reimbursement for their criminal cases and imprisonment for offenses stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot.",
      "The Proud Boys Jan. 6 rioters, who met in a social media \"X spaces\" gathering last month, are calling for Bondi's resignation, after the Justice Department filed a motion in federal court in Florida last week, asking a judge to dismiss a civil lawsuit filed by Enrique Tarrio, Zachary Rehl, Domenic Pezzola and other Proud Boys. All the men were imprisoned for their roles in the riot before President Trump pardoned them on the day he was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "The Proud Boys' lawsuit seeks more than $100 million in damages and alleges the men suffered \"A parade of horribles: egregious and systemic abuse of the legal system and the United States Constitution to punish and oppress political allies of President Trump, by any and all means necessary, legal, or illegal.\"",
      "\"Through the use of evidence tampering, witness intimidation, violations of attorney-client privilege, and placing spies to report on trial strategy, the government got its fondest wish of imprisoning the J6 Defendants,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a filing on Aug. 25, the Justice Department responded that the Jan. 6 defendants had not yet exhausted administrative remedies before they filed suit and also argued the U.S. enjoys sovereign immunity from such claims.",
      "An attorney for Jan. 6 defendants sent a statement to CBS News, saying, \"Motions to dismiss are a common reaction to a civil complaint, and we anticipated that the attorney the government assigned to the case would make such a motion.\u00a0 We are confident that the Court will see that the Federal government's outrageous treatment of my clients justifies allowing the suit to continue. \"",
      "In their publicly posted X spaces meeting video, Jan. 6 defendants and supporters blistered the Justice Department for opposing the Proud Boys' civil challenge.",
      "Isaac Thomas, a pardoned Jan. 6 defendant from Michigan who participated in the meeting, said, \"Unfortunately, Pam Bondi's DOJ seems to be advocating for the same things that the Biden regime was advocating for. A long time ago, I joined the call of Trump supporters saying that Pam Bondi needs to step down.\" Thomas said the Jan. 6 defendants \"have been dumped out.\"",
      "Mark McCloskey, an attorney who said he is seeking financial payments for Capitol riot defendants, said in the video he was \"very disappointed\" in the Justice Department's challenge to the Proud Boys lawsuit. He said if the Justice Department opposes other legal challenges seeking restitution or financial awards for Jan. 6 defendants, \"It's going to make our lives very difficult.\"",
      "He predicted more legal challenges would be coming, as some of the more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants pursue financial compensation, and he referenced \"hundreds\" of people who could be impacted.",
      "The Justice Department did not have an immediate comment to the recent Jan. 6 defendants' online meeting.",
      "The civil lawsuit filed by Proud Boys members also alleges malicious prosecution and violation of Fourth Amendment protections, claims that the Justice Department rebutted in its response to the suit.",
      "In their Aug. 25 filing, the Justice Department argued the Proud Boys defendants failed to sufficiently demonstrate the case was \"malicious\" and that their constitutional rights had been violated. The 17-page filing from the department did not address whether the men had been rightfully or wrongfully convicted by a jury.",
      "The Proud Boys also allege harsh conditions in jail in their lawsuit, and it referenced the language used in President Trump's pardon order for Capitol insurrection defendants, which said, \"This proclamation ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and is a process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "An attorney who filed the suit did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CBS News.",
      "A Justice Department attorney who filed the motion to dismiss the Jan. 6 defendants' lawsuit has been harshly criticized by name on social media. In one instance, the attorney was referred to as being one of the \"swamp rats.\" \tNews of the Justice Department court filing also triggered a wave of critical comments about the department in a weekend social media post by a media outlet aligned with Trump supporter Mike Lindell, who made baseless claims about the 2020 election.",

    "story": [
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday signed a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to be more friendly to Republicans, capping off a redistricting push that drew national attention. It also led to California's Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats.",
      "Missouri is following Texas and California's lead, with the state's Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe announcing Friday that he had called for the state's Legislature to convene on Sept. 3 to redraw the state's congressional districts. Missouri has eight representatives in Congress, two of whom are Democrats.",
      "Challenges remain for both Texas and California's new maps. While Texas law only requires the Legislature and the governor's approval to set the congressional maps, civil rights groups have already challenged them in court, accusing the maps of being racially biased. The maps the GOP-controlled Legislature created in 2021 are still being litigated in court.",
      "In California, the state's congressional map must be approved by voters before it takes effect. The Democratic-controlled Assembly and State Senate both approved a measure called Proposition 50 for the Nov. 4 ballot that, if approved, will overhaul the state's congressional maps. California Republicans challenged the maps in court, saying Democrats ignored the 30-day public review period for new legislation, although the state Supreme Court denied the petition on Aug. 27.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off by President Trump in mid-July as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterm elections are often a rebuke of the party in the White House. Mr. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson zeroed in on Texas, with the president claiming Republicans could gain an extra five seats given how the state voted in 2024.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, with Indiana Republicans having met with Mr. Trump and members of his administration on Aug. 27 to try to redraw the state's nine congressional districts to try to oust the two Democratic members. Florida's Republican House speaker last month created a special committee to look into the possibility there.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their state's congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas and California's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 Congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but where Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "In recent years, Texas Democrats have made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district out in the rural areas, making it a district that was 72% Democratic to one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also takes aim at Districts 32 and 33 in Dallas-Fort Worth, changing Rep. Julie Johnson's 32nd District from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's 33rd District remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts under the proposed maps. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California currently has 52 representatives in Congress, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats. The GOP has made inroads in the Golden State, starting in 2020, when Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. Republicans have held onto two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "Other Republican strongholds in Central California have been spread into other districts. Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, Districts 1 and 3 both have dramatic shifts. GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part is absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's 3rd Congressional District, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",

      "An 11-year-old boy died in a Houston hospital Sunday after he was shot while carrying out a \"ding-dong ditch\" prank the previous night, police said. The boy hasn't been identified.",
      "The Houston Police Department said the boy had been playing the prank with friends late Saturday, which entails ringing the doorbell of a home and running away before anyone inside comes out to answer it. A witness saw the boy ring a doorbell in east Houston and flee the property before he was struck by gunfire, according to a police statement.",
      "Officers received a call about the shooting just before 11 p.m. local time. Police said the boy was wounded when they arrived and taken to a nearby hospital, where he died on Sunday. Sgt. Michael Cass, a Houston homicide detective, told CBS News affiliate KHOU that a witness had recalled someone exiting the house that was pranked and \"shooting at the kids running down the street.\"",
      "Cass told KHOU that \"unfortunately, sadly enough, one of the boys, who was 11 years old, was shot in the back.\"",
      "A man was detained at the home where the shooting happened and questioned by homicide detectives on Sunday, KHOU reported. But Houston police later said the person was released after questioning. They asked anyone with information about the case to contact the department as their investigation into the shooting continues.",
      "\"Ding-dong ditch\" pranks have culminated in deadly shootings before.",
      "In 2023, a California man was found guilty of murder for intentionally ramming the car of three teen boys who rang his doorbell as a prank, killing all of them, the Associated Press reported. More recently, in May, a man was charged with second-degree murder in Virginia after he shot and killed a teenager who had filmed a TikTok video of himself playing the doorbell prank on the man's home, according to\u00a0The New York Times.",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are among the dignitaries who attended the parade. It was the first time Kim, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin appeared together. The trio has\u00a0been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts.",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. military on Tuesday struck a drug-carrying boat hailing from Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, as tensions spike between the Trump administration and the Venezuelan government.",
      "President Trump announced the strike during an unrelated Tuesday afternoon Oval Office event, saying the military had \"shot out\" the boat \"moments ago.\" He said his team had been briefed on the strike by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social that 11 people were killed in the strike, which he said targeted members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that the Trump administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. He posted a video that appeared to show a military strike against a small boat.",
      "\"Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!\" the president wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Rubio posted on X that the military carried out a \"lethal strike\" in the southern Caribbean Sea. He said the \"drug vessel\" had departed Venezuela and \"was being operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization.\" Rubio later told reporters he believed the drugs that were allegedly carried on the boat were probably headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or \"some other country in the Caribbean.\" A senior defense official also said the U.S. had conducted a \"precision strike\" against the vessel.",
      "The strike came after the U.S. confirmed last month\u00a0that the Navy would boost its presence near Venezuela, deploying three warships to the waters off the South American country as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro called the ships an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat\" and deployed military forces to the country's coastline, vowing to defend against any possible U.S. attack.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela's government.",

Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking in U.S. federal court in 2020. Last month, Attorney General Pam Bondi doubled the reward for Maduro's arrest to $50 million.",

    "summary": "President Trump has touted himself as a Nobel-worthy peacemaker. Here's what some foreign policy analysts say about the disputes he cites.",
    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves credit for ending six or seven wars during his first months in office, arguing that he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.",
      "\"I stopped seven wars, and they were, they're big ones too,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "\"I've settled six wars, and a lot of people say seven because there's one that nobody knows about,\" he said in an August 19 interview.",
      "A White House official provided a list of seven conflicts the president is referencing: Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.",
      "\"There has been more progress towards peace than ever before because of this President's leadership,\" the official wrote.",
      "The recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace prize is expected to be announced next month.",
      "Over 100 people have received the award since the 19th-century chemist Alfred Nobel created the prize to honor a \"person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"",
      "Four U.S. presidents have been past laureates, most recently Barack Obama who received the prize for supporting nuclear nonproliferation and international diplomacy.",
      "Foreign policy experts say that while Mr. Trump has helped broker ceasefires, including one between Israel and Iran, several of the foreign conflicts cited by the administration were not full-scale wars \u2014 and many remain unresolved. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification on why the president has repeatedly labeled all seven conflicts as settled wars.",
      "Some of these peace efforts involved limited U.S. involvement, and in other instances, it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump's role was decisive.",
      "Here's a look at the conflicts:",
      "Israel and Iran",
      "After Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities in June, a 12-day conflict resulted in the deaths of\u00a0 about 28 Israelis and hundreds of Iranians before a ceasefire was reached with U.S. and Qatari involvement. Mr. Trump claimed credit, saying he had ordered U.S. airstrikes on Iran's uranium enrichment sites and pressed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold back from further strikes.",
      "Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at Brookings, said Mr. Trump deserves some credit for this ceasefire. \"He managed to use a combination of a good relationship with Netanyahu, but also a willingness to put a little pressure on Netanyahu that I think contributed to the at least temporary cessation of hostilities,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "But other foreign policy experts said tensions between the nations are far from resolved, and Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in early July that the Defense Department estimated the U.S. strikes likely delayed Iran's nuclear program by \"one to two years.\"",
      "Larry Haas, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said, \"I very strongly disagree with the notion that the president brought peace to Iran and Israel. We may be in a quiet period in terms of direct confrontation, but Iran right now is trying to regroup.\"",
      "Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo",
      "In June, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo announced a peace deal after multiple days of talks in Washington mediated by President Trump and Qatar.",
      "The deal aimed to end three decades of fighting over Congo's mineral reserves. Yet the violence has continued, with both sides accusing each other of violating peace terms. Human Rights Watch reported that M23, an armed group that U.S. officials believe is backed by Rwanda, killed over 140 civilians in eastern Congo in July.",
      "\"It's a premature declaration of success, when in fact we are just getting to the starting line,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan",
      "In August, Mr. Trump helped negotiate an agreement aimed at normalizing relations and\u00a0 reopening transportation routes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have spent decades fighting for control of the Karabakh region.",
      "O'Hanlon and Haas agreed the Trump administration pushed the deal forward in part by inviting both leaders to the White House. Leaders of both countries also credited Mr. Trump for the agreement, saying he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But the deal is not a formal peace agreement and requires ratification. One remaining sticking point is that Azerbaijan wants Armenia to remove any mention of territorial claims to Azerbaijan's land from its constitution before officials sign a final deal.\u00a0 Armenia's prime minister has expressed willingness to change the constitution but has not specified a date for a referendum.",
      "Thailand and Cambodia",
      "In late July, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a ceasefire after an outbreak of fighting killed at least 35 people. President Trump said that he had pressured both sides to come to the table by threatening trade consequences.",
      "The U.S. is a top importer for both counties, and foreign policy experts CBS News spoke to said Mr. Trump's tariff threats played a significant role in securing a ceasefire. \"He helped move things along with economic pressure,\" Haas said.",
      "The border dispute is continuing, though, with Thai officials accusing Cambodia of laying new landmines. Cambodia denied doing so.",
      "India and Pakistan",
      "India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in May after weeks of cross-border missile and drone strikes. The deal ended the latest flare-up in their long-running dispute over Kashmir, which both nuclear-armed nations claim as their territory.",
      "Pakistan credited the Trump administration's efforts in U.S.-led talks, and nominated him for the Nobel Peace prize. But India insisted its own pressure on Pakistan, not U.S. diplomacy, drove the deal.",
      "Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it's a stretch to call the dispute over Kashmir settled.",
      "\"There is no real ending to this conflict,\" he said, noting that future negotiations could be complicated by Mr. Trump's decision to impose steep tariffs on India, a key partner.",
      "Egypt and Ethiopia",
      "Mr. Trump also claims he brokered peace between Ethiopia and Egypt, which have disagreed about Ethiopia's decision to construct a hydroelectric dam in the Nile.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump tried to broker a deal between the countries and suspended some aid to Ethiopia because of a lack of progress. In June, the president mentioned the dispute on Truth Social, writing, \"There is peace, at least for now, because of my intervention, and it will stay that way!\"",
      "No deals have been announced, however. Ethiopia still plans to officially open its dam in September over Egypt's objections that it will restrict the flow of water to its country. And while Egypt previously threatened to go to war over the dam, this conflict has remained a diplomatic one.",
      "O'Hanlon said of the dispute, \"I would not call the Egypt-Ethiopia interaction a war.\"",
      "Serbia and Kosovo",
      "In 2020, President Trump helped negotiate a deal between Serbia and Kosovo to help normalize economic ties, but progress stalled afterwards.",
      "Talks have continued with European leaders, but no breakthroughs have emerged. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which Serbia still does not recognize.",
      "\"His deal-making, to the extent that it existed, actually occurred in his first term, and he really hasn't stopped what's going on,\" Haas said.",

      "The painting, believed to be \"Portrait of a Lady\" by Italian baroque artist Giuseppe Ghislandi (1655-1743), was recognized by the Dutch newspaper AD in a photo of a house for sale in the Argentine seaside resort of Mar del Plata.",
      "The authenticity of the artwork cannot be confirmed until it is recovered, but it is believed to have been stolen from Amsterdam art dealer Jacques Goudstikker during World War II. Goudstikker died while fleeing the Netherlands in 1940 when the country was invaded by Nazi Germany.",
      "The for-sale notice revealed what is believed to be the Ghislandi painting in the house of Friedrich Kadgien, a financial adviser to Adolf Hitler's right-hand man and an art aficionado who plundered paintings taken from Jewish-owned galleries in Nazi-occupied Europe, according to The Associated Press. Kadgien  later fled to Argentina, along with other Nazi war criminals. He died in 1978.",
      "Interpol and the Argentine federal police are involved in the search for the artwork.",
      "After the article was published, the image was removed from the real estate listing. When Argentine police entered the house last week, they found a tapestry of a horse hanging in the spot the painting had been in the pictures, AP reported. Four property searches conducted Monday \u2014 at Kadgien's home and three other residences linked to the family \u2014 failed to yield the artwork, AP said.",

      "The prosecutor's office said investigators carrying out the search had seized two other artworks from the home of another Kadgien daughter that appeared to be from the 1800s.",
      "\"The works will be analyzed to determine if they are linked to paintings stolen during World War II,\" the office added.",

      "Pechier's youngest alleged victim, 4-year-old Teddy, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The doctor's oldest alleged victim was 89.",
      "The trial, which begins in Besancon on Sept. 8 and will last until December, caps a seven-year investigation that stunned the medical community.",

    "summary": "Egypt's government has removed security barriers around the U.K. Embassy in Cairo amid a dispute over protest action directed at Egyptian diplomatic facilities in Europe.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0The British Embassy in Cairo said Sunday that it had temporarily closed its main building after Egyptian authorities removed concrete security barriers from around the compound's exterior perimeter. The barriers had been there for decades as a security measure.",
      "\"The main Embassy building is temporarily closed while we review the impact of works undertaken by the Egyptian authorities in the vicinity,\" a U.K. Foreign Office spokesperson told CBS News in a statement on Monday, noting that the embassy remained in operation and only the primary building was closed.",
      "There was no official comment from the Egyptian government about the removal of the barriers outside the U.K. embassy, but the move came amid escalating diplomatic tension between Egypt and several countries over protests targeting Egyptian missions abroad, including in the Netherlands, Austria, France, Turkey, the U.K., Canada, the U.S, and in Israel.",
      "In recent months, pro-Palestinian demonstrators have chained the doors of Egyptian embassies and consulates closed from the outside and spray-painted slogans on their walls, mostly demanding the opening of the Rafah crossing between northeast Egypt and the war-torn Gaza Strip.",
      "Egyptian officials have said their side of the Rafah crossing has remained open since the Gaza war erupted almost two years ago, while the Israeli military controls the Palestinian side and how much aid is allowed in, and how many people are allowed out.",
      "The Egyptian authorities have argued that the protests are not random nor peaceful, but rather organized attacks against the country, and they have accused European host governments of failing to protect their staff and diplomatic premises from vandalism.",
      "Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty was heard in a video circulated online suggesting Egypt could take reciprocal action, saying: \"If their governments won't provide adequate security for our missions, then we should reconsider our own deployments.\"",
      "In a few cases, activists who back the Egyptian government have taken matters into their own hands and gathered outside embassies in European capitals, declaring that they were there to protect the facilities.",
      "Most of these activists have identified themselves as members of the so-called \"Union of Egyptian Youth Abroad.\"",
      "The self-described leader of that group, Ahmed Abdel Qader, was detained in London last week by British police. According to Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty raised the case in an Aug. 26 phone call with U.K. National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell.",
      "In a\u00a0statement published online that day by the Egyptian government, the foreign ministry said it was following his detention \"with great concern\" and had requested urgent clarification of the circumstances surrounding the arrest, stressing Egypt expected his \"prompt release.\"",
      "Social media videos show the activist was released after being detained, and there were no charges announced. London's Metropolitan Police told CBS News it could not immediately offer any information on the circumstances of the Egyptian national's detention or his subsequent release.",
      "Amid the dispute, a relatively new political party in Egypt, the National Front Party, issued a lengthy statement declaring solidarity with the foreign ministry and condemning the activist's detention in London.",
      "\"We will not protect those who do not protect us,\" the party, which was founded in December, declared in its Aug. 26 statement. It condemned the detention of \"one of Egypt's loyal sons\" as a \"blatant violation of justice, human rights, and the rules of diplomatic relations.\"",
      "The party called on the government to reconsider the privileges granted to British diplomatic missions in Cairo. It specifically pointed to the U.K. Embassy in the affluent, heavily fortified Garden City neighborhood where the U.S. and other embassies are also located.",
      "The party argued that the British facility's concrete barriers and other security measures had turned the area into \"a closed-off zone\" and disrupted residents' lives, and it demanded that the barriers be removed.",

    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014\u00a0China will host its biggest military parade ever on Wednesday, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and Japan's formal surrender. The massive procession will go down Chang-an Avenue, the name of which means \"Eternal Peace.\"",
      "Joining Chinese Prime Minister Xi Jinping for the \"Victory Day\" event \u2014 which will showcase some of China's newest and most advanced weapons \u2014 will be Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.",
      "Rehearsals have been underway for weeks, and security in the sprawling Chinese capital has been extra tight. All buildings overlooking the parade route will be locked down as the leaders and other dignitaries from 26 countries take in the spectacle, along with some 50,000 spectators.",
      "For China's 72-year-old leader Xi, it will be a landmark moment. It's the third and most important military parade he will have overseen since coming to power in 2012. As commander-in-chief of the world's largest standing armed forces, he will watch as tens of thousands of troops under his orders march toward Tiananmen Square in central Beijing.",
      "It will be a visceral display not only of China's growing military might and newest hardware, including hypersonic weapons, nuclear capable missiles, fighter jets and underwater drones, but of its growing clout as a geopolitical power, with deepening ties to some of the United States' most potent adversaries.",
      "North Korea's Kim arrived in Beijing Tuesday aboard his green armored train, stopping to inspect one of his own country's missile production facilities on the way before crossing into China.",
      "The parade will be the first time that Kim appears together with both Xi and Putin \u2014 offering him a first multilateral diplomatic event.",
      "The symbolism of the three leaders together on a stage with Xi's military thundering past in formation will be undeniable. Xi is expected to be flanked by Putin and Kim. Together, they have been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts.",
      "Xi is bringing together the leaders of some of the most heavily sanctioned nations in the world. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian and the leader of Myanmar's ruling military junta, President Min Aung Hlaing, will also be attending, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "It is a clear show of solidarity against the West, and it's being seen as a direct challenge to the U.S.-led world order that has prevailed for a century. Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up that status quo clear for at least several years.",
      "\"We, together with you and with our sympathizers, will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\" Russia's longtime Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in 2022, ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "The gathering in Beijing will represent a clear challenge to President Trump's claim to be fostering close working relationships with Xi, Putin and Kim. Xi's bond with Putin was on clear and deliberate display in the days leading up to the parade.",
      "China and Russia have declared their \"no limits partnership,\" and while China claims to maintain a neutral stance on Russia's war in Ukraine, Beijing's support of the war effort \u2014 by providing dual-use technology and continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas in defiance of Western sanctions, has proven to be an economic lifeline funding Putin's three-and-a-half-year war.",
      "During talks at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday, Putin hailed \"unprecedentedly high relations\" with China and thanked his \"dear friend\" Xi for the warm welcome.",
      "Kim's support for Russia's war has been even more direct. Since October last year, North Korea has sent around 13,000 troops, along with conventional weapons, to support Russia's war effort. South Korea's intelligence services estimate that around 2,000 North Korean troops have been killed fighting alongside Russian forces.",
      "The parade will be a show of both China and Russia's implicit support for Kim's nuclear weapons program, which remains the subject of numerous United Nations sanctions.",
      "Xi burnished his credentials as a geopolitical powerbroker at a regional security summit in Tianjin, northern China, that ended on Monday. He hosted more than 20 world leaders there, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\"We should uphold fairness and justice,\" Xi declared at the gathering of the Shanghai Corporation Organization, seemingly trying to claim moral high ground amid the upheaval and strained relationships caused by Mr. Trump's global trade war and isolationist policies. \"We must oppose the Cold War mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices.\"",
      "Without mentioning the U.S. or its president by name, Xi told the assembled leaders of non-Western countries: \"We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics.\"",
      "On Monday Xi, Putin and Modi were shown together smiling and laughing at the summit \u2014 a deliberate public display of warmth and camaraderie. Just last week, the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a close ally of Mr. Trump, called the summit \"performative\" and accused China and India of being \"bad actors\" for fueling Russia's war.",
      "At the parade this week, Xi is not only asserting China as a reliable and stable partner, but also showing off his country's burgeoning alliances, influence and its military might and power. It is a message that many will see as being aimed squarely, if not entirely, at China's rival across the Pacific.",

      "The death toll from a major earthquake that rocked eastern Afghanistan on Sunday night has climbed to at least 1,411, the ruling Taliban's chief spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Tuesday, as rescue operations, hampered by rough terrain, continued across the affected region. At least 3,124 people were injured and 5,412 houses were destroyed, Mujahid said.",
      "\"The destruction is overwhelming. Entire villages have been flattened, and people are still trapped under the rubble of collapsed homes. Roads are blocked, making it nearly impossible to move supplies or evacuate the wounded,\" Dr. Abudl Majeed Ahmadzai, Director of the Kabul Asia Hospital, who travelled to the affected region, told CBS News.",
      "In the hard-hit Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, the earthquake trapped people under rubble when homes, which are largely made of wood and mud in the region, collapsed onto them as they slept.",
      "Ahmadzai said the injured were being carried on foot for hours, sometimes on makeshift stretchers, just to reach basic help.",
      "\"The situation is desperate. Food is scarce, medical help is insufficient, and the only effective way to deliver assistance is by helicopter. Without air support, reaching these communities is nearly impossible,\" Ahamdzai told CBS News.",
      "In locations where helicopters could not land, Taliban deputy spokesperson Hamdullah Fitrat said \"dozens of commando forces were air dropped to pull the injured from the rubble and move them to safer ground.\"",
      "Fitrat said a camp had been established in Kunar's Khas Kunar district, as well as two coordination sites near the disaster zones, to help coordinate emergency aid and assist with the rescue operation, transfer of the injured, and burial of the dead.",
      "The United Nations urged the international community to step forward to help.",
      "\"We cannot afford to forget the people of Afghanistan who are facing multiple crises, multiple shocks, and the resilience of the communities has been saturated,\" the U.N.'s resident coordinator for Afghanistan, Indrika Ratwatte, told The Associate Press. \"These are life and death decisions while we race against time to reach people.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the health ministry in Kabul, Sharafat Zaman, on Monday called for international aid to help handle the devastation caused by the earthquake.",
      "\"We need it because here lots of people lost their lives and houses,\" Zaman told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The magnitude 6 earthquake, which struck at about 11:40 p.m. on Sunday, was the third major earthquake to strike Afghanistan since the Taliban seized control of the country in 2021. Their takeover prompted deep cuts in international aid funding as many donors, including the United States, were concerned that financial support could help fund the Taliban government.",
      "Since retaking power, the Taliban have brought back many restrictive policies, especially targeting women and girls, including excluding them from secondary education and most career choices.",
      "The policies have marginalized women and made it much more difficult for them to access basic services, including health care. With women now prevented from working in many health care roles, there's concern that some earthquake victims may be reluctant to seek medical assistance.",

      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0At least 1,000 people were killed on Sunday when a landslide swallowed an entire village in war-torn Sudan's Darfur region after days of heavy rain, the rebels who hold the region said Tuesday.",
      "\"Initial information indicates the death of all village residents, estimated to be more than one thousand individuals, with only one survivor,\" the Sudan Liberation Movement, which controls the area, said in a statement. It appealed to the international community for help for those around the decimated village of Tarasin.",
      "The mountainous area is extremely difficult to reach, and it has become a refuge for people fleeing the violence of the civil war that has engulfed parts of Sudan, including Darfur, with thousands having arrived by foot in recent months.",
      "Tarasin, in an area known for citrus farming, had seen days of heavy rains, which ultimately led to the landslide, which was one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit Sudan in recent history. But the Sudanese people have had no shortage of man-made suffering.",
      "Fear Sudan's civil war poised to get worse",
      "Sudan's civil war is now entering its third year. It has been fought largely between the Sudanese Armed Forces and a rival paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces. Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed since the fighting broke out more than two years ago, both from the violence directly, and from hunger and disease.",
      "The war has left more than half of Sudan's population facing crisis levels of hunger, in what aid groups have labeled the single largest humanitarian crisis in the world.",
      "The SLM, which announced the landslide, controls Tarasin and some other parts of the mountainous area in western Darfur, but the group has largely stayed out of the fighting.",
      "The RSF controls most of the Darfur region, except the state capital El-Fasher, which its forces have had surrounded for more than 500 days. Over the past few days they have launched a new offensive, seeking to capture the last major city in Darfur not already under their control.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people are now trapped inside the city behind earthen walls newly built by the RSF forces, facing the threat of execution if they try to leave. Sources on the ground say there is little food left in El-Fasher, so local residents are slowly starving as artillery flies over their heads daily.",
      "The Sudan Doctors Network medical group said Tuesday that overnight shelling of El-Fasher had killed 18 people and wounded more than 100 others, including women and children. The group said in a social media post that it was holding \"the international community, the United Nations and the African Union fully responsible for their disgraced silence and failure to protect more than half a million civilians trapped inside El Fasher, who are being subjected daily to shelling, starvation, and slow death.\"",
      "Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab has analyzed satellite photos of El-Fasher that it says show the RSF moving quickly to build berms around the city.",
      "\"The RSF is creating a literal kill box around El-Fasher,\" the group warned in a report published late last week. More than 19 miles of earthen walls have been built since May 9, the group said in a statement provided along with satellite imagery on Aug. 27. \"These berms will create physical boundaries to prevent smuggling goods like food and medicine into El-Fasher or people out of El-Fasher.\"",
      "The United Nations children's agency UNICEF, in a statement last week,estimated that 260,000 people, including 130,000 children, remain trapped in \"desperate conditions cut off from aid for more than 16 months.\"",
      "International humanitarian organizations have been prevented from reaching El-Fasher by the RSF, and UNICEF has warned that, with no new supplies getting in, acute malnutrition is spreading. The agency has cited recent reports that during one week alone, 63 people, mainly women and children, died of malnutrition in the blockaded city.",
      "Before El-Fasher was surrounded, UNICEF said it was treating some 6,000 children for severe acute malnutrition at health facilities in the city. Those children have now had their therapeutic food and medical care suspended.",
      "\"We are witnessing a devastating tragedy \u2013 children in El-Fasher are starving while UNICEF's lifesaving nutrition services are being blocked,\" the group's Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement in late August. \"Blocking humanitarian access is a grave violation of children's rights, and the lives of children are hanging in the balance.\"",

    "summary": "The case involves 10 migrants between 10- and 17-years-old who entered the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending any unaccompanied migrant child to Guatemala unless they have a deportation order, just hours after lawyers alerted her of what they described as a hurried government effort to deport hundreds of children.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued her order as the deportation effort was fully underway, with planes with migrant children on board ready to take off from Texas.",
      "Earlier Sunday, in the overnight hours, Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order barring officials from sending a group of 10 migrant children between the ages of 10 and 17 to Guatemala, granting a request from attorneys who alleged the effort would skirt legal protections Congress established for these minors. She also scheduled a hearing in the afternoon to weigh the case's next steps.",
      "But Sooknanan abruptly moved up the hearing earlier on Sunday, saying she had been alerted that some migrant children were already in the process of being deported.",
      "As that hearing got underway, Sooknanan  announced she had just issued a broader temporary restraining order blocking any deportations of unaccompanied children from Guatemala and in U.S. custody who did not have a deportation order. She instructed Drew Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration, to quickly inform officials they had to halt their deportation plans.",
      "Ensign acknowledged deportation planes had been prepared to take off on Sunday, but said they were all \"on the ground\" and still on U.S. soil. He said he believed one plane had taken off earlier but had come back.",
      "At the request of Sooknanan, Ensign said he confirmed that the children on the planes would be deplaned and returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for caring for migrant minors who enter the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
      "The Justice Department said 76 unaccompanied children were slated to be sent to Guatemala on Sunday before the effort was blocked. Of those, 16 had been returned to HHS custody as of Sunday evening and the rest were expected to be in HHS care by 10:30 p.m.",
      "HHS houses unaccompanied children in shelters or foster homes until they turn 18 or until they can be placed with a suitable sponsor in the U.S., who are often family members.",
      "Sooknanan conceded her temporary restraining order, which is set to last 14 days, is \"extraordinary\" but justified it on the grounds that the government had decided to \"execute a plan to remove these children\" in the \"wee hours\" of a holiday weekend.",
      "In their lawsuit, lawyers for the group of Guatemalan children said the Trump administration had launched an effort to deport more than 600 migrant minors to Guatemala without allowing them to request humanitarian protection, even though U.S. law protects them from speedy deportations. They alleged the children could face abuse, neglect or persecution if returned to Guatemala.",
      "Ensign, the Justice Department attorney, said the Trump administration was not trying to formally deport the Guatemalan children under U.S. immigration law, but instead repatriate them to Guatemala so they could reunite with relatives there. He said the Guatemalan government and the children's relatives had requested the reunifications.",
      "But lawyers for the children disputed the government's claims, citing one case in which they say a child's parents did not request any repatriation. They also said a law known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act says unaccompanied migrant children who are not from Mexico must be allowed to see an immigration judge and apply for legal protections before any deportation effort. Some of the children facing return to Guatemala still have pending immigration cases, the attorneys said.",

    "summary": "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u200b on Monday claimed eight U.S. military vessels \"with 1,200 missiles\" were targeting his country.",
    "story": [
      "Venezuelan President\u00a0Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0on Monday said he \"would constitutionally declare a republic in arms\" if the South American country were attacked by forces that the\u00a0United States government has deployed\u00a0to the Caribbean.",
      "Maduro claimed eight U.S. military vessels \"with 1,200 missiles\" were targeting his country, calling them \"the greatest threat that has been seen on our continent in the last 100 years,\" AFP reported.",
      "His comments during a news conference come as the U.S. government this week is set to boost its\u00a0maritime force in the waters off Venezuela\u00a0to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. The U.S. has not signaled any planned land incursion by the thousands of personnel being deployed. Still, Maduro's government has\u00a0responded by deploying troops\u00a0along its coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as by urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia.",
      "\"In the face of this maximum military pressure, we have declared maximum preparedness for the defense of Venezuela,\" Maduro said of the deployment, which he characterized as \"an extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\"",
      "The U.S. Navy now has two Aegis guided-missile destroyers \u2014\u00a0the USS Gravely and the USS Jason Dunham\u00a0\u2014 in the Caribbean, as well as the destroyer USS Sampson and the cruiser\u00a0USS Lake Erie\u00a0in the waters off Latin America. That military presence is set to expand.",
      "Three amphibious assault ships \u2014 a force that encompasses more than 4,000 sailors and Marines \u2014 would be entering the region this week, a defense official told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to describe ongoing operations.",
      "The deployment comes as President Trump has pushed for using the military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into U.S. communities and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities.",
      "Washington has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel and has\u00a0doubled the bounty\u00a0for his capture to $50 million. The U.S. has, however, made no public threat to invade Venezuela.",
      "Mr. Trump has directed the Pentagon\u00a0to use military force\u00a0against Latin American drug cartels deemed terrorist organizations, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News earlier this month.",
      "Of the eight Latin American drug trafficking groups the Trump administration has\u00a0designated as terrorist organizations, one is Venezuelan. It's not clear if or when the military could take action.",
      "On Monday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yv\u00e1n Gil, citing a United Nations report, told his counterparts in various Latin American countries that the deployment of U.S. maritime forces is built on a \"false narrative\" as 87% of cocaine produced in Colombia departs through the Pacific and traffickers attempt to move only 5% of their product through Venezuela. Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific and Caribbean, are the world's top cocaine producers.",
      "Gil added that the narrative \"threatens the entire region\" and an attack on Venezuela \"would really mean a complete destabilization of the region.\"",
      "\"Let us immediately demand an end to this deployment, which has no other reason than to threaten a sovereign people,\" he added during a virtual meeting of members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States regional group.",
      "Maduro also used his news conference to insist that he was the legitimate winner of\u00a0last year's presidential election. But ample and credible evidence has shown the contrary, prompting several countries,\u00a0including the U.S., to not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's president.",
      "Maduro, sworn in to a third six-year term in January, added that his government maintains two lines of communication with the Trump administration, one with the State Department and another with Mr. Trump's envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell. He called Secretary of State Marco Rubio a \"warlord\" pushing for action in the Caribbean to topple Venezuela's government.",
      "Since the July 2024 presidential election, Venezuela's political opposition has been urging the U.S. and other countries to pressure Maduro into leaving office. Its leader, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, last month thanked Mr. Trump and Rubio for the deployment of the vessels, describing the move as \"the right approach\" toward Venezuela's government, which she described as a \"criminal enterprise.\"",
      "Maduro on Monday, however, warned that U.S. military action against Venezuela would \"stain\" Mr. Trump's \"hands with blood.\"",
      "\"President Donald Trump, the pursuit of regime change is exhausted; it has failed as a policy worldwide,\" Maduro said. \"You cannot pretend to impose a situation in Venezuela.\"",

      "The numbers are clear. Safety case readiness reached 86 percent, with a goal of 100 percent by launch. Autonomous miles percentage climbed to 98 percent. Remote assistance free trips rose to 76 percent, with a target of more than 90 percent.",
      "These metrics may sound technical, but they show that PlusAI is moving steadily toward putting driverless freight trucks on the road within two years.",

      "159-YEAR-OLD COMPANY EMBRACES DRIVERLESS TRUCKS",
      "PlusAI reports that its driverless trucks could be ready to hit the road within the next two years. (PlusAI)",
      "Why PlusAI's 2025 results matter for autonomous trucks",
      "Even if you never step into a truck, these results affect your daily life. Every product you buy travels by truck at some point, whether it's groceries, clothing or furniture. The way those trucks operate influences cost, availability and safety on the road.",
      "The trucking industry faces three major challenges. There are not enough long-haul drivers to meet demand. Costs continue to rise due to labor shortages, tariffs and fuel prices. And safety is a concern because human drivers can get tired or distracted.",
      "Autonomous trucks could help address each of these issues. PlusAI's vehicles are already hauling freight on Texas highways today, and they are also undergoing road testing in Sweden. The company has already logged more than five million autonomous miles across the United States, Europe and Asia. That real-world experience fuels the AI system with the data it needs to improve.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "The PlusAI Safety Case Framework. Data shows that self-driving trucks will roll out by 2027. (PlusAI)",
      "How PlusAI plans to launch autonomous trucks by 2027",
      "PlusAI has created a roadmap that sets it apart. Instead of retrofitting trucks with autonomous systems, it is working with major manufacturers like TRATON GROUP, Hyundai and IVECO to integrate the technology at the factory. This approach makes scaling production faster and ensures consistency.",
      "The initial launch is planned for the Texas Triangle, a major freight corridor connecting Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. From there, PlusAI plans to expand into other U.S. routes and eventually Europe.",
      "The company has also committed to publishing regular performance updates as it transitions to a public company. By sharing measurable results, PlusAI builds trust with regulators, the public, and businesses that may one day rely on its trucks to move goods.",
      "\"We have a clear roadmap to the commercial launch of SuperDrive,\" said David Liu, CEO and co-founder of PlusAI. \"By publicly sharing these performance metrics, we are showing our commitment to safety and scalability while bringing partners, customers, and regulators along on this journey.\"",
      "What's next for PlusAI and driverless freight trucks?",
      "PlusAI still has milestones to meet. Safety readiness must rise from 86 percent to 100 percent. Remote Assistance Free Trips must surpass 90 percent. These are ambitious goals, but the progress so far suggests the company can achieve them.",
      "Fleet trials are scheduled to begin later this year, and PlusAI continues testing in both the United States and internationally. Each step adds to the case that driverless trucks will be ready for commercial launch in 2027.",

      "What this means for you",
      "As a shopper, autonomous trucks could mean faster and more affordable deliveries. As a driver, you may soon share highways with self-driving freight haulers. As a business owner, this technology could reduce logistics costs and ease the impact of driver shortages.",
      "The bigger picture is that autonomous trucks are moving from testing to real use. They are no longer limited to pilot projects. You may see them alongside you on the road sooner than expected.",

The difference is that this shift is approaching within just a few years. The progress PlusAI reports today offers a glimpse of that future. If the company continues on this track, driverless trucks could become a normal part of daily life by the end of the decade.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Forget roaring lawnmowers and fuel-guzzling tractors. Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.",

      "WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR",
      "Why solar grazing with sheep cuts costs and emissions",
      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.",
      "WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM",
      "Sheep graze near solar panels in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "How agrivoltaics turns sheep and solar panels into profits",
      "This isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",
      "Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.",
      "GOOGLE TURNS CO2 INTO BATTERY POWER FOR CLEAN ENERGY",
      "Sheep grazing cuts operations and maintenance costs for solar operators. (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "Major solar farms scale up sheep grazing across thousands of acres",
      "This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.",
      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",
      "Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "Chad Raines opens the gate to a solar panel zone in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024. This solar farm has six different solar panel zones on 1,800 acres of land.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "What solar grazing means for you",
      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.",
      "For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fight climate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.",

This approach blends sustainability with practicality. It supports healthier soil, boosts biodiversity and strengthens rural economies, all while helping solar farms operate more efficiently. With growing investment and proven results, solar grazing is emerging as a smart, scalable solution.

      "Pediatricians and psychologists raise red flags about these AI toys. Young children naturally form attachments. If those attachments shift to chatbots, kids may learn to trust machines more than people.

That responsiveness can be powerful. It can encourage curiosity, vocabulary growth, and even creativity. But it can also crowd out human interactions, those subtle facial expressions, pauses, and \"nos\" that children need to experience to learn empathy and resilience. Another risk is that AI companions are trained to be overly charming and agreeable. Instead of challenging a child's thinking, these\u00a0\"sycophantic\" toys may simply tell kids what they want to hear. Over time, that could nudge children toward believing comforting lies instead of asking hard questions, a toxic pattern for developing critical thinking.",

      "Go through old online accounts, shopping profiles or cloud storage that may still hold sensitive data. Deleting what you no longer use reduces the amount of information that could be stolen in future breaches or sold on dark web forums. You can also get help from a data removal service.",

If you get an email or text claiming to be from TransUnion, your bank or any service asking you to \"verify\" details, don't click on the link. Instead, log in through the official website or call customer service directly.",

Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for every service. Even if hackers get hold of one, they won't be able to use it elsewhere. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your passwords have been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your passwords have appeared in known leaks.

If someone tries to break into your email, banking app or social media account, they'll also need the one-time code from your authenticator app or text message. This makes stolen credentials much less useful.",

A credit freeze with all three major bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, prevents anyone from accessing your credit file without your approval. It's free and can be temporarily lifted if you need to apply for credit.",
      "Watch your bank and credit card statements for unfamiliar charges, no matter how small. Set up transaction alerts where available. You should also pull your free annual credit report to check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries, which could be signs of fraud.",
      "If your Social Security number, driver's license or other sensitive identifiers were exposed, you may want to sign up for an identity theft protection service. These services monitor credit reports, dark web forums and financial activity for signs of misuse. Some also include insurance or recovery assistance if your identity is stolen, giving you added peace of mind beyond basic credit monitoring. If you're one of the affected TransUnion users, make use of the 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. If not, you might get one yourself for the future.",

      "Scammers spoof Apple, Netflix, and other brands to push fake subscription charges posing as DocuSign. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The emails often use well-known brands such as Apple, Netflix, Expedia, or even lawn service companies to make them seem credible. Some also include a \"DocuSign\" link with a security code, creating the illusion that you need to access a file to confirm the transaction.",
      "In reality, neither Apple nor these other companies sends billing receipts through DocuSign. That detail alone is a red flag. Another telltale sign is the sender's address. It may contain odd characters, such as a Cyrillic \"B\" replacing the \"B\" in \"Billing,\" which helps scammers bypass spam filters.",
      "AMAZON ALERTS CUSTOMERS ABOUT IMPERSONATION SCAMS",
      "How the DocuSign scam works",
      "The scam aims to catch you off guard and pressure you into acting fast. The email claims your Apple Pay account has been charged for a subscription or purchase. It includes an order ID, a charge amount, and a DocuSign link that supposedly holds a receipt or confirmation file. To make it look even more convincing, some versions add a security code to \"unlock\" the document.",
      "The message also lists a phone number and urges you to call if the charge was not authorized. That number is the core of the scam. Instead of reaching Apple, Netflix or whichever company the email pretends to represent, you end up speaking with a scammer posing as a support agent.",
      "Once you're on the call, the scammer tries to convince you that your account has been compromised or that the payment must be reversed right away. From there, the tactics vary. They might ask for your Apple ID, banking details, or card numbers. They may pressure you to download remote access software so they can \"fix\" the issue on your device. In some cases, they demand payment for fake account protection or reversal fees.",

      "Fraudulent billing emails claim Apple Pay charges and link victims to fake support lines using DocuSign. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Be cautious with any links in suspicious emails. Scammers often mask harmful links behind text that looks legitimate, such as \"View Document\" or \"Review Payment.\" Hover over the link without clicking to see the real web address. If it does not match the official company domain, do not click.",

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at CyberGuy.com.",
      "Instead of trusting the email, confirm whether a charge actually exists. Apple users can review purchases directly from the Settings app under their Apple ID. If nothing shows up, the receipt is fake. Other services have similar ways to check history.",
      "The less information scammers can find about you online, the harder it is for them to craft convincing attacks. Consider removing old accounts you no longer use, limit the personal details you share publicly on social media, and use data removal services when possible. This reduces the risk of your name, email, or phone number being targeted in scams like this.",

Mary Kay is offering its top-performing sales reps a fully electric Cadillac Optiq wrapped in a custom \"pink pearl\" finish. It's the first time the company's legendary incentive vehicle is going fully electric, and it's turning heads while staying true to its roots.",

      "Mary Kay pink Cadillacs are more than just a flashy ride. They represent achievement, empowerment, and recognition. Only the top 1% of the company's sales force qualify. Even then, it's not handed out lightly; recipients can choose a $900 monthly bonus instead. But 90% take the car. What makes these cars even more exclusive is that they're leased for just two years. When the lease ends, they're returned and repainted to the original factory color. That makes a true pink Cadillac a rare sight outside of Mary Kay circles. And yes, they're beautiful. That pink pearl paint is exclusive, and few people outside the company ever get to drive one.",

      "Most modern Windows PCs rely on Microsoft Defender as their first line of defense against malware. Over the years, it has evolved into a capable and often underrated antivirus that blocks a wide range of threats. But a hacker group has found a way to abuse a legitimate Intel CPU tuning driver in a \"Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver\" (BYOVD) attack to completely disable Microsoft Defender.",
      "The technique has been observed since mid-July 2025 and is already being used in active ransomware campaigns. The method doesn't rely on exploiting a software bug or delivering an obviously malicious file.

      "The Akira ransomware group has developed a new way to bypass security tools by using a legitimate Intel CPU tuning driver called rwdrv.sys from the performance-tweaking tool ThrottleStop. Security firm GuidePoint Security says attackers load this driver to gain kernel-level access to Windows systems, then install a second malicious driver, hlpdrv.sys, which changes the DisableAntiSpyware registry setting via regedit.exe to shut down Microsoft Defender.",

A strong antivirus software with real-time protection, kernel-level monitoring, and frequent updates can provide backup security. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

They might hash or encrypt your email, but the behavioral patterns remain. You can still be tracked, but aliases interrupt that chain.",

That small change prevents them from linking my activity with other accounts or sites. It is not a perfect solution, but it adds just enough friction to disrupt the tracking systems.",

The mental pause required to generate a new alias made me more deliberate. And it gave structure to the mess.

      "A new report reveals that more than 14,000 migrants who had hoped to cross into the United States have turned back and reversed course due to the Trump administration's hardline border enforcement policies.",
      "The new phenomenon, referred to as \"reverse flow\" migration, has mainly impacted migrants fleeing the economic and political turmoil in Venezuela and who had been moving north through Central America toward the U.S.",
      "Since 2017, around 8 million people have fled the political crisis in Venezuela.",
      "The report, published by the governments of Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica with the support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had plummeted by 97% this year.",

      "\"It\u2019s time to go back \u2014 the American dream wasn\u2019t like this,\" one migrant said, per the report.",
      "The report links the reversal to President Donald Trump's border policies, with 46% of migrants citing policy changes and 49% saying they could not enter the U.S. Another 34% ran out of resources and 17% feared detention or deportation.",
      "Migration through the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023 when more than half a million migrants crossed.",
      "The report also blames U.S. financial reductions for drying up humanitarian aid. As a result, NGOs and U.N. agencies that were filling protection gaps in places like the Dari\u00e9n Gap and along return routes had to shut down or scale back operations.",
      "Additionally, tougher transit restrictions in Panama mean the traditional pipeline toward the U.S. is nearly shut.",
      "That flow slowed somewhat in 2024 but dried up almost completely early this year as President Trump fulfilled his campaign promise of shutting the border.",
      "Southwest border apprehensions hit a\u00a0monthly record low in July, with only 4,399 apprehensions, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. For the third month in a row, there were zero releases. This is the new all-time record low, beating the prior record low of 6,070 in June.",
      "Biden repeatedly had single days when apprehensions ranged from 8,000 to 10,000 migrants, with his highest single month being December 2023, when 249,785 Border Patrol apprehensions were recorded.",

Others said they didn\u2019t know where they were going.",
      "Some migrants will continue moving south within Latin America, but the report warns they face unsafe boat journeys, dependence on smugglers and criminal groups that prey on returnees. Others remain stranded in places like Palenque, Miramar, Necocl\u00ed, Bah\u00eda Solano and Medell\u00edn, sleeping in parks or abandoned buildings without access to food, shelter or medical care.",
      "Humanitarian monitors said many are turning to survival strategies such as informal work, begging or even transactional sex.",

      "A retired NYPD homicide detective told Fox News Digital that significant cultural and policy shifts in 2020, including bail reform and George Floyd backlash, are contributing to low homicide case clearance rates across the United States.",
      "According to the Murder Accountability Project, which tracks unsolved homicides, the homicide case clearances \u2013 that is, the percentage of homicides where a perpetrator is identified, arrested and referred for prosecution \u2013 plummeted to an all-time low of 52.3% in 2022. Clearance rates were above 60% before 2020, according to the organization, which cites data from the FBI.",
      "\"So there was a seismic change in law enforcement in 2020,\" Teresa Leto told Fox News Digital.",

      "Leto is a 30-year NYPD veteran who tackled gang crime and worked as a homicide detective, among other roles.",
      "The first 2020 event that altered the way streets are policed, and helped cause a decline in homicide clearance rates, was the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Leto.",
      "\"So the courts then became remote. Everything slowed down within the courts,\" she said. \"A lot of trials didn't take place. People were let out of jail for safety reasons. Many officers and support staff got sick. There was a high rate of people being out sick. There was a decrease in people in the squads, in detective squads to investigate crimes. So that really affected everything.\"",
      "In March of that year, she said, the situation spiraled even further out of control after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police, driving an anti-police sentiment that halted recruiting and caused officers to retire early, among other consequences.",
      "Protesters in Austin, Texas, on June 5, 2020, following the death of George Floyd. (Lola Gomez/Austin American-Statesman via AP, File)",
      "\"There was a lot of protests going on,\" Leto said. \"To deal with the protests, they took a lot of the investigators, the detectives out of the squads, out of, like investigating terrorism, investigating homicides and rapes and murders to deal with the unrest in the streets throughout the United States.\"",
      "DC VIOLENCE HAS GROWN FAR MORE DEADLY, DESPITE DEMS CLAIMING 30-YEAR LOW",
      "According to Leto, that led to a dramatic decline in arrests.",
      "\"There was an issue of recruiting in most of the police departments,\" she said. \"Because of the George Floyd \u2026 backlash, people didn't want to join the police department. So people didn't want to join the police department, and then you had less people coming in and less people going into a detective unit.\"",
      "Consequently, existing detectives began working more overtime. In what Leto described as an \"overtime bubble,\" some detectives worked so much that they were forced to retire, further depleting detective units.",
      "A George Floyd mural in Minneapolis, Minnesota. (AP)",
      "\"So you had a recruitment issue, you had retention issue. So now, like, if you're looking at New York City, which I know about, you have a lot of detective squads that are really low in manpower,\" she said. \"So they doubled their caseload.\"",
      "Born out of the Floyd fallout were new social justice initiatives like \"bail reform,\" which made matters worse.",
      "US CRIME DROPPED WIDELY IN 2024, FBI SAYS \u2014 WITH SOME NOTABLE CAVEATS",
      "\"They made it easier for people to get out of jail without posting bail, because a lot of people didn't afford bail,\" Leto said. \"And they deemed certain crimes as nonviolent. So, for example, [third-degree robbery], which is forcibly taking property from a person, which is violent, that's deemed as a nonviolent crime.\"",
      "When violent offenders are let out on bail, they go right back to committing crimes, possibly even escalating their levels of violence.",
      "\"So, that all added to the fact that less cases are being handled, and less cases are being cleared,\" Leto said.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 22:33:39 GMT",
    "summary": "The Republican-led House Oversight Committee released more than 33,000 pages of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender.",
    "story": [
      "The House committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein released a batch of files Tuesday related to the late convicted sex offender amid pressure for the Trump administration to release more information about his case.",
      "The documents stem from a subpoena House Oversight Committee chair James Comer, R-Ky., issued last month to the Justice Department. The committee released 33,295 pages of records Tuesday, which it has referred to as a first batch of documents from the Justice Department.",
      "The content of all the records was not immediately clear, but many files had already been made public through court filings and other releases.",
      "The committee is investigating the Epstein case weeks after President Donald Trump and his administration faced outrage from both supporters and opponents for saying they would not release more files related to Epstein, even though Trump ran on a promise of more transparency.",
      "Many of the documents being released Tuesday night are public filings in the criminal cases involving Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. The documents include the types of records that have been released through the federal courts that oversaw related cases and were reported on at the time.",
      "Examples of the previously released files include video and audio of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's interview with Maxwell, video from inside Epstein\u2019s home in West Palm Beach, Florida, after Palm Beach police executed a search warrant, video from inside the jailhouse where Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and audio taken by Palm Beach police pertaining to their initial investigation into Epstein.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said the \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of pages the committee released Tuesday were already public.",
      "\u201cTo distract from their continued White House cover-up, the DOJ released the interview between Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell is desperately seeking a pardon from the Trump Administration and cannot be trusted,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "\u201cDOJ\u2019s limited disclosure raises more questions than answers and makes clear that the White House is not interested in justice for the victims or the truth,\" Garcia added. \"Democrats forced a bipartisan vote to subpoena the Epstein files in their entirety, and the Administration must comply. There is no excuse for incomplete disclosures. Survivors and the American public deserve the truth.\"",
      "Garcia said that only 3% of the files released were new and that 97% were already public. A spokesperson for the Republican-led committee defended the release in response.",
      "\u201cThe Trump DOJ is in compliance with the Committee\u2019s subpoena and is providing documents on a rolling basis,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "In a separate statement, Garcia said the only new disclosure in the trove was less than 1,000 pages from Customs and Border Protection detailing flight logs of Epstein\u2019s plane and forms for re-entry into the United States.",
      "The documents show that male and female passengers were on the flights. But pursuant to Justice Department policy, the only person named in the customs records is Epstein himself; passengers\u2019 names were redacted.",
      "Other Democrats on the committee slammed Tuesday's release as not transparent enough. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said it as only a drop in the bucket of all the files.",
      "Khanna has been working with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., on what is known as a discharge petition to force a vote on legislation that would require the Justice Department to release all of the Epstein files, despite opposition from House GOP leadership.",
      "Khanna called Tuesday\u2019s release a \u201cdistraction of a document dump\u201d that he said \u201cwill only draw more attention\u201d to the news conference he and Massie will host Wednesday morning with some of Epstein\u2019s victims.",
      "Massie said Tuesday's release of records \"doesn't change a thing\" for the discharge petition, adding that \"eventually people are going to pore through those documents and find out there's nothing new in there.\"",
      "He also asserted that the White House is trying to stop the bill because they don\u2019t want everything released, and accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of helping to \u201ccover up a sex trafficking ring.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are things that the White House doesn\u2019t want out there that my legislation would cause to be released,\u201d Massie said.",
      "A spokesperson for Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day about Massie\u2019s discharge petition, Johnson said: \u201cI would describe virtually everything Thomas Massie says related to this issue as meaningless.\u201d",
      "In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday night, Massie said he did not think Trump had done anything illegal, but said perhaps friends of his might be implicated.",
      "\u201cI think the best way to clear President Trump\u2019s name is to release all the files. I actually don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything criminal. I think he may be covering for some rich and powerful people that are friends of his,\u201d Massie said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get it out in the open, regardless of whose friends might be incriminated.\u201d",
      "In response to Massie\u2019s comments, a White House official told NBC News in an email: \u201cHelping Thomas Massie and Liberal Democrats with their attention-seeking, while the DOJ is fully supporting a more comprehensive file release effort from the Oversight Committee, would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration.\u201d",
      "Massie and Trump have clashed before, with the Kentucky Republican seeking to win over MAGA allies by pushing for more transparency with the Epstein files after he isolated himself by opposing Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d earlier this year. Trump\u2019s allies later launched a super PAC to unseat Massie, who has served in the House since 2012.",
      "Other examples of the contents of Tuesday\u2019s release include transcripts of certain parts of hearings in the Epstein criminal case. Hundreds of files are individual pages of other reports, including a Justice Department Office of Professional Responsibility investigation into the nonprosecution agreement Epstein reached in 2008 with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida, which was then headed by Alex Acosta, who later was Trump\u2019s labor secretary in his first term.",
      "Acosta is scheduled to appear voluntarily before the Oversight Committee this month after victims raised concerns about why he was not included in an earlier batch of subpoenas to people like former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Attorney General Merrick Garland.",
      "GOP leaders are trying to stave off an internal party revolt as Khanna and Massie attempt to force a floor vote on their bipartisan bill to release all the Epstein files immediately.",
      "A House Republican co-sponsor of that bill told NBC News that they communicated to both the White House and Comer that they wanted the panel to publicly release the batch of files the Justice Department handed over as soon as possible, or else they may feel compelled to back Massie and Khanna\u2019s bill.",
      "The member said Tuesday that the message to the White House and Comer was essentially: \u201cDon\u2019t put me in a corner.\u201d",
      "A GOP leadership source told NBC News that leaders have been going all out to quash the discharge petition. That includes adding a resolution to the floor schedule this week to express support for the Oversight Committee\u2019s Epstein probe."

      "The jury in Los Angeles found that the security guard did not prove the elements of assault, negligence or emotional distress. Cardi B, wearing a black outfit with white dots and a red bow, made a sign of the cross after the jury read its conclusions.",
      "\"I'm not even playing around. Even if I'm at my death bed, I swear to God, I will say it at my death bed \u2014 I did not touch that woman,\" Cardi told reporters outside court after the verdict was read.",
      "Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Alm\u00e1nzar, was sued by a former security guard who worked at a Beverly Hills building in 2018 when she was pregnant with her first child. The guard, Emani Ellis, alleged that Cardi spat on her and scratched her nose with a fingernail during a verbal altercation.",
      "Cardi, the \"Bodak Yellow\" rapper, has denied the allegations. During her testimony last week, she alleged that Ellis followed her to the floor of her obstetrician's office and seemed to be recording her.",
      "They got into a heated confrontation, both women testified.",
      "Cardi testified that she felt concerned as she was pregnant and the woman, whom she described as \"security heavy,\" was bigger than her. Though she admitted to using some profane language, Cardi denied ever laying hands on Ellis.",
      "\"She couldn\u2019t get a scratch from me because I didn\u2019t touch her,\u201d she said.",
      "Ellis told the court that the incident traumatized her and that she required a cosmetic procedure because of the scarring from the alleged assault. She also lost her job over the incident, Ellis said.",
      "Dr. David Finke, whom Cardi was going to see that day, testified that it was he who reported Ellis to their practice administrator over the incident. He told the court that he was in his office when he heard yelling.",
      "When he came out, Finke said, he saw his receptionist standing between Ellis and Cardi before he intervened. He addressed Ellis as he tried to de-escalate the situation, Finke told the court, by telling her to \"stop\" and \"do your job.\"",
      "He never saw Cardi assault Ellis, Finke testified. His receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, also told the court that she did not see a physical fight between the women.",
      "No one else was in the doctor's office that day because it had closed the office early that Saturday afternoon for Cardi's privacy, according to court testimony.",
      "Cardi\u2019s attorney, Peter Anderson, told jurors in closing arguments that Ellis failed to prove her case under the law.",
      "\u201cArguing, yelling, even using profanity is not something you can sue over,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of normal life.\u201d",
      "The jury deliberated for less than an hour Tuesday.",
      "Among the spectacles that captured interest online was Cardi's hair, which she explained in court were wigs. She even seemed to confuse an attorney in the courtroom after she swapped a short black wig for a long blond one.",
      "\"I\u2019m telling you guys, when I say that my forehead is raw from changing all these wigs \u2014 raw. Raw, raw, raw,\u201d Cardi told reporters outside court after the verdict.",

      "\"I don\u2019t think that it reflects the truth, but I\u2019m not disappointed,\" she told reporters after the verdict. \"We know that the justice system is sometimes flawed, and unfortunately that was the case for me.\"",

      "As thousands of attendees began to arrive at Black Rock City on Aug. 24, they were met with a massive dust storm. The less-than-desired desert weather was reminiscent of the heavy rain and mud that trapped festival-goers in 2023.",
      "Following the dust storm, an unexpected guest arrived: One woman, who didn't know she was pregnant, \"spontaneously\" delivered her baby in her RV camper, which she shared with her husband.",
      "And as the festival was nearing its end, authorities said a man was found dead Saturday in a suspected homicide. The discovery was made as the \"Man,\" a large human-shaped wooden sculpture at the center of the festival, was engulfed in flames.",
      "But the news reports prompted some people on social media to question if this year's Burning Man was more chaotic than years past.",
      "The event, which in recent years has been described as \"Silicon Valley\u2019s desert playground,\" is known as a place for people to celebrate art and community.",
      "Burning Man organizers state that the event is \"not a festival,\" but rather a \"crucible of creativity\" where \"all are welcome.\" Participants are asked to follow the \"10 Principles of Burning Man,\" which include \"radical inclusion,\" \"radical self-reliance,\" and \"civic responsibility,\" according to Burning Man's website.",
      "Attendees converge on a dry lake bed in Nevada, which is called \"the playa,\" where they \"build a fully functional city where they live and work for a week, then make it disappear without a trace,\" the website states.",
      "Those who attend are told to \"bring all you need to survive, and then some,\" Burning Man states. That means \"Some people bring only the basics; others bring everything including the kitchen sink.\" They are also encouraged to share resources, as only ice is available for purchase.",
      "Even as Burning Man's Event FAQ cautions those who attend to be prepared for any type of weather, this year's pilgrimage appeared plagued by a series of  setbacks.",
      "\"In Nevada, there is a saying: if you don't like the weather, stick around for five minutes and it will change,\" the website states. \"Only one thing is completely predictable about the weather in the Black Rock Desert: Unpredictability.\"",
      "The organizers recommend attendees to \"be prepared for volatile extremes, and ready for anything and everything\" and check out the event's \"Survival Guide\" before getting to the desert.",
      "This year, attendees were hit with a host of poor conditions at once.",
      "It started with dust storms, which resulted in four minor injuries. Wind gusts at 50 mph plagued Black Rock City during the festival\u2019s first weekend, wreaking havoc on campsites and causing major travel delays.",
      "The storms, which ushered in high winds and low visibility, prompted festival officials to close the gates to get into Black Rock City. The harsh winds overturned campsites for those already inside.",
      "Then came the heat. On the festival\u2019s first day, temperatures neared 100 degrees Fahrenheit with humidity levels around 57%. Another dust advisory was issued for that night.",
      "And finally, the rain. Days of thunderstorms left the campgrounds soggy, though nothing could compare to the two days of downpours that trapped attendees at the 2023 festival, who were told to \"shelter in place\" as the soil devolved into a muddy mess.",
      "The inclement weather did not appear to claim any lives, but it did claim the infamous Orgy Dome, according to the structure's Instagram account.",
      "In the aftermath of the bad weather, an unexpected bright spot surprised a couple, who welcomed a baby at their RV.",
      "A spokesperson from Burning Man Project told Today.com that a baby was \"spontaneously\" born on Aug. 27 in Black Rock City.",

    "story": [
      "Families of the victims of a 2023 mass shooting in Maine and dozens of survivors intend to file a negligence lawsuit Wednesday against the U.S. government, alleging the military and others failed to respond to warning signs and a threat by the gunman, who was an Army reservist.",
      "Robert Card, 40, killed 18 people at a bowling alley and a bar in Lewiston, setting off a two-day manhunt that ended when he died by suicide, authorities said.",
      "The approximately 100 plaintiffs are expected to name the Defense Department, the Army and Keller Army Community Hospital in West Point, New York, in the suit, which a team of four law firms is set to file in federal court in Maine.",
      "\"The Army repeatedly broke its promise to protect the community that it pledges to defend and must be held responsible,\" Maine attorney Travis Brennan said in a statement.",
      "Benjamin Gideon, another lawyer in Maine representing plaintiffs, added that \"it's hard to imagine the Army ever accepting accountability without being forced to do so in court.\"",
      "The law firms served legal notices of their intention to sue in October. The lawyers said the Army had multiple opportunities to intervene in Card's case but did not, including as early as May 2023, when his son reported that his father's mental health appeared to be deteriorating and his behavior was erratic.",
      "The Justice and Defense departments and the Army could not immediately be reached for comment about the planned complaints. They previously declined to comment on the legal notices.",
      "National Trial Law, a law firm in Texas, is working with two Maine law firms to represent the plaintiffs. The firm represented survivors and families of those killed in the 2017 church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, committed by an Air Force service member. The federal government was found partly liable in that case, and the survivors agreed to settle in 2023 after the Justice Department appealed.",
      "The legal cases in Maine are similarly focused on the federal government and actions taken by military members.",
      "Despite the apparent warning signs, a definitive motive for the rampage in Lewiston remains unclear. Card's family has said that he claimed to have been hearing voices months before when he was fitted for high-powered hearing aids and that he had grown increasingly paranoid.",
      "A month after the shootings, an independent commission was formed to investigate it and scrutinize any lapses by the military, law enforcement and Card's family.",
      "The commission's report and the military investigations shed light on possible failures.",
      "The military's internal report said Card's unit failed to follow certain procedures after he was involved in a shoving incident with another reservist in July 2023, leading him to be hospitalized for two weeks in a psychiatric unit at a civilian hospital. At the time, his reported symptoms included psychosis and homicidal ideations, and he had created a \"hit list,\" according to the military's investigation.",
      "The Army then prohibited Card from having access to weapons on duty.",
      "A separate independent report by the state commission concluded that while the gunman was solely responsible for his conduct, there were missteps. Leaders of Card's unit \"failed to undertake necessary steps to reduce the threat he posed to the public,\" such as ignoring \"strong recommendations\" from his mental health providers to stay engaged with his care and ensure any weapons in his home were removed.",
      "The commission also found that his unit \"neglected to share\" all the information it had about past threats with the local sheriff\u2019s office.",
      "In addition, the commission said, medical staff members at Keller Army Community Hospital, where Card was initially evaluated three months before the shootings, failed to file a so-called SAFE Act notice. The report is used to alert authorities when people may be dangers to themselves or others.",
      "The military and independent commission reports also detailed how Card's family alerted a Sagadahoc County sheriff's sergeant about his deteriorating mental health. The report further said that law enforcement agencies had probable cause to initiate Maine's \"yellow flag\" law, which allows them to confiscate people's firearms if they are believed to be threats to themselves or others, but that that was never done.",
      "Sagadahoc County Sheriff Joel Merry said after the shootings that the Army Reserve did inform his department that Card threatened to \"shoot up\" the National Guard base in Saco, Maine. Merry said he distributed a statewide alert to law enforcement agencies after deputies sent to Card\u2019s home in Bowdoin could not find him.",
      "Investigators also looked at whether Card's exposure to low-level blasts as a hand grenade instructor in the military was tied to the \"severe\" traumatic brain injury that researchers found evidence of last year. The military denied in its report that any brain-related injury was linked to his service.",
      "The law firms had previously said they were focusing on the federal government and not local law enforcement because the Army had access to the most critical information about Card's state of mind and could have helped ensure he did not have access to firearms.",
      "Card's unit failed to conduct a required \"line of duty investigation,\" which would have documented the condition of his mental state, the Army acknowledged in its internal report.",
      "Card's family told NBC News a year after the shootings that they supported further research of military service members' brains. They also launched a nonprofit organization, Rising Over Brokenness, to focus on mental health awareness and brain injuries among service members.",

      "A federal appeals court blocked the Trump administration Tuesday from using an 18th century wartime law to remove people alleged to be Venezuelan gang members from the United States.",
      "A panel of the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to block President Donald Trump's deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, ruling the administration's claim that members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang are part of a warlike invasion is not true.",
      "\"Our analysis leads us to GRANT a preliminary injunction to prevent removal because we find no invasion or predatory incursion,\" the panel's majority wrote.",
      "American Civil Liberties Union immigrants\u2019 rights lawyer Lee Gelernt, who represented plaintiffs before the Supreme Court and the 5th Circuit, said in a statement Tuesday night that the ruling is just.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s attempt to use a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate immigration was rightly shut down by the court,\" Gelernt said. \"This is a tremendously important victory reigning in the administration\u2019s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.\u201d",
      "In February, the State Department designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, and in March, the White House said the gang was \"conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States\" that include \"mass illegal migration to the United States.\"",
      "In April, the Supreme Court halted the Trump administration's plans to deport people alleged to be members of Tren de Aragua being held in Texas to El Salvador, saying they were given insufficient notice \u2014 24 hours \u2014 under the right to due process.",
      "The administration since implemented seven days' notice of removal for similar situations, which the 5th Circuit said satisfied the time element needed for due process.",
      "The 5th Circuit limited its ruling to the use of the Alien Enemies Act for removal and said it does not cover other legal means of removing \"foreign terrorists.\"",
      "Judge Leslie Southwick, an appointee of President George W. Bush, and Judge Irma Ramirez, an appointee of President Joe Biden, voted in favor of the preliminary injunction that blocks use of the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Judge Andrew Oldham, a Trump appointee, voted against it and argued in a fiery dissent that Trump is subject to different guardrails from other presidents.",
      "\"His declaration of a predatory incursion is not conclusive,\" Oldham said. \"Far from it. Rather, President Trump must plead sufficient facts\u2014as if he were some run-of-the mill plaintiff in a breach-of-contract case\u2014to convince a federal judge that he is entitled to relief.\""

    "summary": "Boomers are the only generation planning to increase their holiday shopping budgets this year, according to PwC's 2025 Holiday Outlook.",
    "story": [
      "\u2019Tis the season for tighter budgets.",
      "Holiday spending in the U.S. is expected to fall 5% this year, driven largely by Gen Z\u2019s sharp 23% pullback, according to a survey from a leading consulting and accounting firm.",
      "Households plan to be more deliberate in their spending over the holidays, prioritizing value and deciding what to splurge on and where to scale back, says PwC\u2019s 2025 Holiday Outlook, which was released Wednesday.",
      "The decline in planned spending underscores how economic uncertainty is affecting consumer sentiment heading into the most important retail season of the year.",
      "Gen Z\u2019s outlook this year is a stark reversal from 2024, when their projected holiday budgets surged 37%. (Their actual holiday spending rose a more modest 6%, according to PwC\u2019s analysis of credit and debit card panel data.) PwC\u2019s new survey found that 25% of Gen Z say their financial situation is worse than it was last year, compared with 17% who said the same in 2024.",
      "Inflation, job insecurity and new financial responsibilities are driving Gen Z to rein in spending, said Ali Furman, consumer markets industry leader at PwC. Many young adults are navigating major life transitions amid a tough job market for recent graduates, often without much savings. \u201cIt\u2019s a coming of age story for this generation,\u201d with some buying homes and starting families for the first time, forcing them to budget more carefully, Furman said.",
      "Millennials and Gen Xers are keeping their holiday budgets roughly the same as last year, the survey found. Baby boomers are the only generation projecting an increase, with average spending up 5%.",
      "Anzhelika Parenchuk, a 23-year-old first-year doctoral student at George Washington University, said she\u2019s approaching the holidays with a tighter budget and turning more to discount retailers like Dollar Tree and Five Below for gifts.",
      "\u201cThey have the same things as other retail stores, but cheaper,\u201d she said.",
      "Parenchuk said she learned her lesson after overspending last year. Now, without income from her former job since starting graduate school, she said she is stricter with her budget. Inflation has forced her to buy fewer things, and news about tariffs has her worried prices could climb even higher, she said.",
      "Gen Z\u2019s tighter holiday budgets are also driven by spending habits that prioritize splurging on experiences while seeking affordability elsewhere, curbing their appetite for lavish holiday shopping, PwC\u2019s Furman said.",
      "Gen Z is reluctant to cut back on concerts and events, even as ticket prices surge. A recent survey from the marketing agency Merge found that 86% of young adults admit to overspending on events. \u201cThose experiences are taking up a lot more of their wallet share,\u201d Furman said, \u201cso they have less money to spend on holiday than they have in the past.\u201d",
      "Teens and young adults, shaped by an era of constant price increases, are drawn to value and embrace \u201cdupe\u201d culture, seeking cheaper alternatives to brand names, which allow them to stretch their budgets. Even for high-status items, Gen Z prefers them at a reasonable price, a concept that Furman called \u201caffordable exclusivity.\u201d She pointed to Labubus as a prime example of this phenomenon.",
      "These value-oriented spending patterns reflect a larger trend across the economy. Retailers catering to budget-conscious consumers have been among the winners this past earnings season, with Dollar General, Five Below, TJ Maxx and Walmart reporting better than expected sales. On the other hand, companies that target middle- to higher-income shoppers, such as Target, have struggled.",
      "A recent survey conducted by the digital coupon company RetailMeNot also found that shoppers plan to spend less this holiday season, with average budgets down 15%. Rising prices topped respondents\u2019 concerns, and many said they would switch to different brands or start shopping earlier if tariffs drive costs higher. Shoppers are \u201cspending with purpose, planning ahead, and saying yes to the right deals, just not all the deals,\u201d said Stephanie Carls, retail insights expert at RetailMeNot.",
      "The pressure on consumers could become even stronger in the coming months, which is probably bad news for someone like Parenchuk, who said rising prices have weighed on her shopping experience.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s depressing,\u201d she said, noting that what used to cost $10 now feels closer to $20, and she\u2019s had to buy fewer items. She said she is trying to manage stress by setting stricter budgets.",
      "\u201cGet cash, and once you\u2019re out, you\u2019re out,\u201d Parenchuk said, \u201cjust be more strict with myself for my own good.\u201d"

      "Cassidy, a doctor who has been supportive of vaccines, is in a delicate position as the top Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee who provided a pivotal vote to confirm Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he secured assurances about vaccines. Cassidy is also running for re-election next year.",
      "Cassidy declined Tuesday to say whether he regrets his vote for Kennedy or whether he has confidence in him after Kennedy triggered CDC Director Susan Monarez's removal, leading to a spate of resignations by top CDC employees who accused Kennedy of undermining an influential vaccine committee.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The online world had its doubts, but yes, Donald Trump is alive.",
      "Trump\u2019s televised appearance in the Oval Office on Tuesday doubled as a proof-of-life test for the conspiracy-minded after a week\u2019s worth of speculation that he was gravely ill or worse.",
      "The topic \u201c#Trumpdead\u201d had been trending on X. Yet there he was, indisputably among the living and taking swipes at the usual foils: California Gov. Gavin \u201cNewscum,\u201d the \u201cfake news,\u201d mail-in voting and crime in Democratic-run cities. He even worked in a mention of the once-mighty University of Alabama football team\u2019s losing to Florida State on Saturday.",
      "When did he learn of his demise? a reporter cheekily asked him.",
      "Trump, 79, said he had gotten reports that, because he hadn\u2019t been spotted much in recent days, something was amiss. He hadn't been seen in public from Tuesday afternoon until Saturday morning, following a more-than-three-hour on-camera Cabinet meeting, the longest of his term.",
      "\u201cI knew they were saying: \u2018Is he OK? How is he feeling? What\u2019s wrong?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI was very active this Labor Day\u201d weekend, which included golf outings at his club in northern Virginia and repeated posts on his social media platform.",
      "Trump may be a victim of his own ubiquity. He is in front of the cameras so often that when he\u2019s not, people notice and may leap to conclusions that he\u2019s ill.",
      "Trump has jumped to similar conclusions himself when it comes to political opponents. For years, he has relentlessly cast doubt on Joe Biden\u2019s vitality and mental fitness. Since he returned to office, he has depicted Biden as the infirm puppet of controlling aides who used an autopen to mask his decline.",
      "Trump renewed the attack Tuesday, saying of Biden: \u201cWe know he wasn\u2019t in the greatest shape.\u201d",
      "Feeding the online rumors was a persistent bruise on the back of Trump\u2019s right hand, which at times has appeared to be covered in makeup. In February, the White House said the bruise was the result of Trump\u2019s \u201cconstantly working and shaking hands all day every day.\u201d His doctor wrote in July that Trump takes aspirin as part of a \"cardiovascular prevention regimen\" and that the bruising is a side effect.",
      "As a candidate, Trump benefited from the internet, raising millions online and using social media to spread viral messages. Now, in his second term, he is coping with an online audience that examines every pixel in his photos and is quick with a diagnosis, informed or not."

      "The jury in Los Angeles found that the security guard did not prove the elements of assault, negligence or emotional distress. Cardi B, wearing a black outfit with white dots and a red bow, made a sign of the cross after the jury read its conclusions.",
      "\"I'm not even playing around. Even if I'm at my death bed, I swear to God, I will say it at my death bed \u2014 I did not touch that woman,\" Cardi told reporters outside court after the verdict was read.",
      "Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Alm\u00e1nzar, was sued by a former security guard who worked at a Beverly Hills building in 2018 when she was pregnant with her first child. The guard, Emani Ellis, alleged that Cardi spat on her and scratched her nose with a fingernail during a verbal altercation.",
      "Cardi, the \"Bodak Yellow\" rapper, has denied the allegations. During her testimony last week, she alleged that Ellis followed her to the floor of her obstetrician's office and seemed to be recording her.",
      "They got into a heated confrontation, both women testified.",
      "Cardi testified that she felt concerned as she was pregnant and the woman, whom she described as \"security heavy,\" was bigger than her. Though she admitted to using some profane language, Cardi denied ever laying hands on Ellis.",
      "\"She couldn\u2019t get a scratch from me because I didn\u2019t touch her,\u201d she said.",
      "Ellis told the court that the incident traumatized her and that she required a cosmetic procedure because of the scarring from the alleged assault. She also lost her job over the incident, Ellis said.",
      "Dr. David Finke, whom Cardi was going to see that day, testified that it was he who reported Ellis to their practice administrator over the incident. He told the court that he was in his office when he heard yelling.",
      "When he came out, Finke said, he saw his receptionist standing between Ellis and Cardi before he intervened. He addressed Ellis as he tried to de-escalate the situation, Finke told the court, by telling her to \"stop\" and \"do your job.\"",
      "He never saw Cardi assault Ellis, Finke testified. His receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, also told the court that she did not see a physical fight between the women.",
      "No one else was in the doctor's office that day because it had closed the office early that Saturday afternoon for Cardi's privacy, according to court testimony.",
      "Cardi\u2019s attorney, Peter Anderson, told jurors in closing arguments that Ellis failed to prove her case under the law.",

      "\"I don\u2019t think that it reflects the truth, but I\u2019m not disappointed,\" she told reporters after the verdict. \"We know that the justice system is sometimes flawed, and unfortunately that was the case for me.\"",

    "summary": "The Republican-led House Oversight Committee released more than 33,000 pages of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender.",
    "story": [
      "The House committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein released a batch of files Tuesday related to the late convicted sex offender amid pressure for the Trump administration to release more information about his case.",
      "The documents stem from a subpoena House Oversight Committee chair James Comer, R-Ky., issued last month to the Justice Department. The committee released 33,295 pages of records Tuesday, which it has referred to as a first batch of documents from the Justice Department.",
      "The content of all the records was not immediately clear, but many files had already been made public through court filings and other releases.",
      "The committee is investigating the Epstein case weeks after President Donald Trump and his administration faced outrage from both supporters and opponents for saying they would not release more files related to Epstein, even though Trump ran on a promise of more transparency.",
      "Many of the documents being released Tuesday night are public filings in the criminal cases involving Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. The documents include the types of records that have been released through the federal courts that oversaw related cases and were reported on at the time.",
      "Examples of the previously released files include video and audio of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's interview with Maxwell, video from inside Epstein\u2019s home in West Palm Beach, Florida, after Palm Beach police executed a search warrant, video from inside the jailhouse where Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and audio taken by Palm Beach police pertaining to their initial investigation into Epstein.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said the \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of pages the committee released Tuesday were already public.",
      "\u201cTo distract from their continued White House cover-up, the DOJ released the interview between Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell is desperately seeking a pardon from the Trump Administration and cannot be trusted,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "\u201cDOJ\u2019s limited disclosure raises more questions than answers and makes clear that the White House is not interested in justice for the victims or the truth,\" Garcia added. \"Democrats forced a bipartisan vote to subpoena the Epstein files in their entirety, and the Administration must comply. There is no excuse for incomplete disclosures. Survivors and the American public deserve the truth.\"",
      "Garcia said that only 3% of the files released were new and that 97% were already public. A spokesperson for the Republican-led committee defended the release in response.",
      "\u201cThe Trump DOJ is in compliance with the Committee\u2019s subpoena and is providing documents on a rolling basis,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "In a separate statement, Garcia said the only new disclosure in the trove was less than 1,000 pages from Customs and Border Protection detailing flight logs of Epstein\u2019s plane and forms for re-entry into the United States.",
      "The documents show that male and female passengers were on the flights. But pursuant to Justice Department policy, the only person named in the customs records is Epstein himself; passengers\u2019 names were redacted.",
      "Other Democrats on the committee slammed Tuesday's release as not transparent enough. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said it as only a drop in the bucket of all the files.",
      "Khanna has been working with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., on what is known as a discharge petition to force a vote on legislation that would require the Justice Department to release all of the Epstein files, despite opposition from House GOP leadership.",
      "Khanna called Tuesday\u2019s release a \u201cdistraction of a document dump\u201d that he said \u201cwill only draw more attention\u201d to the news conference he and Massie will host Wednesday morning with some of Epstein\u2019s victims.",
      "Massie said Tuesday's release of records \"doesn't change a thing\" for the discharge petition, adding that \"eventually people are going to pore through those documents and find out there's nothing new in there.\"",
      "He also asserted that the White House is trying to stop the bill because they don\u2019t want everything released, and accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of helping to \u201ccover up a sex trafficking ring.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are things that the White House doesn\u2019t want out there that my legislation would cause to be released,\u201d Massie said.",
      "A spokesperson for Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day about Massie\u2019s discharge petition, Johnson said: \u201cI would describe virtually everything Thomas Massie says related to this issue as meaningless.\u201d",
      "In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday night, Massie said he did not think Trump had done anything illegal, but said perhaps friends of his might be implicated.",
      "\u201cI think the best way to clear President Trump\u2019s name is to release all the files. I actually don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything criminal. I think he may be covering for some rich and powerful people that are friends of his,\u201d Massie said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get it out in the open, regardless of whose friends might be incriminated.\u201d",
      "In response to Massie\u2019s comments, a White House official told NBC News in an email: \u201cHelping Thomas Massie and Liberal Democrats with their attention-seeking, while the DOJ is fully supporting a more comprehensive file release effort from the Oversight Committee, would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration.\u201d",
      "Massie and Trump have clashed before, with the Kentucky Republican seeking to win over MAGA allies by pushing for more transparency with the Epstein files after he isolated himself by opposing Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d earlier this year. Trump\u2019s allies later launched a super PAC to unseat Massie, who has served in the House since 2012.",
      "Other examples of the contents of Tuesday\u2019s release include transcripts of certain parts of hearings in the Epstein criminal case. Hundreds of files are individual pages of other reports, including a Justice Department Office of Professional Responsibility investigation into the nonprosecution agreement Epstein reached in 2008 with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida, which was then headed by Alex Acosta, who later was Trump\u2019s labor secretary in his first term.",
      "Acosta is scheduled to appear voluntarily before the Oversight Committee this month after victims raised concerns about why he was not included in an earlier batch of subpoenas to people like former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Attorney General Merrick Garland.",
      "GOP leaders are trying to stave off an internal party revolt as Khanna and Massie attempt to force a floor vote on their bipartisan bill to release all the Epstein files immediately.",
      "A House Republican co-sponsor of that bill told NBC News that they communicated to both the White House and Comer that they wanted the panel to publicly release the batch of files the Justice Department handed over as soon as possible, or else they may feel compelled to back Massie and Khanna\u2019s bill.",
      "The member said Tuesday that the message to the White House and Comer was essentially: \u201cDon\u2019t put me in a corner.\u201d",
      "A GOP leadership source told NBC News that leaders have been going all out to quash the discharge petition. That includes adding a resolution to the floor schedule this week to express support for the Oversight Committee\u2019s Epstein probe."

      "What causes a problem with mice and other rodents",
      "According to experts, every house has what rodents look for \u2014 food and shelter. Of course, not every house has a mouse problem. \u201cThe real difference-maker is how easy it is for a mouse to get into a home,\u201d says Carpenter. \u201c If there is easy access \u2014 like gaps around doors, pipes or vents \u2014 you are literally inviting them in and telling them to make themselves comfortable.\u201d",
      "These gaps don\u2019t even have to be big for them to get inside. \u201cRodents utilize dime-sized openings in the foundation walls and vents and garage doors as their pathways,\u201d says Juan Rezk, chief marketing officer at Certus Pest in Tampa, Florida. \u201cEasy food availability, like an improperly sealed pantry or an open bag of birdseed in the garage, also serves as a welcoming entrance for rodents.\u201d",
      "How to tell if you have a mouse or rodent issue",
      "Worried you may have a mouse problem, but haven\u2019t actually seen one? \u201cIf you have a cat, it may notice mice before you do by staring at the same wall or sniffing around one corner,\u201d says Carpenter. If you don\u2019t have a cat, Carpenter says looking for droppings can help determine if mice are around. \u201cThey look like small black pellets, similar in size to grains of rice.\u201d",
      "Another common sign you have a rodent issue: \u201cAt night, you\u2019ll often hear wall scratching sounds,\u201d says Rezk, who adds that even if you only see one mouse, it usually indicates there are many more somewhere. \u201cMice are creatures that live in social groups, and they reproduce rapidly.\u201d",
      "Once you identify that you have a mouse problem, the first thing you should do is lock away all food sources, clean and block any entry points in your home. \u201cUse steel wool or caulk to seal entry points around your home,\u201d says Rezk. If you can\u2019t locate where the rodents are getting in from or the problem feels bigger than something a few traps will solve, professional assistance may be necessary.",

What\u2019s less appealing about stainless steel, however, is that they get dirty very easily. Whether it\u2019s smudges, scratches, fingerprints or something else, it sometimes feels like the best way to keep stainless steel clean is to simply use them as little as possible.",
      "Fortunately, there are a few easy ways to clean your stainless steel appliances while feeling confident about using them on a daily basis. I spoke with multiple cleaning experts to learn the best stainless steel cleaning methods, including the best (and worst) products to use. I also asked them for the products they love and recommend using themselves.",

Both Dulude and Murphy say that Weiman\u2019s stainless steel cleaning sprays and wipes are effective at getting rid of smudges and fingerprints. Weiman\u2019s stainless steel cleaning spray is also great for cleaning appliances because it leaves a protective layer that prevents smudges and other residue from showing up later on, according to Murphy.

      "\u201cI underlined so many parts of this book to share as inspiration. I fell in love with these characters,\u201d she says.",
      "In the book, Bonhomie locals Margaret Salt and Cal Jenkins come together briefly during the exuberance of the Allied victory in Europe. Jenna says what came next made her cry.",
      "\u201cNot only because it\u2019s super emotional \u2014 anyone who has ever loved a child or a partner will feel that way. I cried because I was going to miss these characters so very much. I would recommend this book to anybody,\u201d she says.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, the author says the book was inspired by the town where his father and paternal grandmother were from \u2014 and a situation she was in.",
      "Ryan learned something about his grandma's past that sparked the idea for a book: His grandmother had had an affair with a married man who lived a few blocks away. He wondered how that would shape a person\u2019s life.",

      "\u201cNaturally I started thinking, \u2018Who\u2019s his fan? What\u2019s his deal?\u2019 The questions expanded both forward and back in terms of chronology and characters' lives. Where did they come from? What did I want their arcs to be?\u201d",
      "He planned on a story that took place over one month, but the idea kept ballooning.",
      "\u201cNo, actually, I think that I want to write about two generations of this family, and I want to write about consequences and deception and betrayal,\u201d he says.",
      "A short-story writer by trade, he constantly felt like he had \u201cbit off more than he could chew,\u201d he says.",
      "Ryan says the novel took six years to complete, plus two more years of edits. He says hearing that his book had been chosen for Read With Jenna was \u201cinconceivable\u201d and something he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to describe.\u201d",
      "\u201cI worked on it for eight years. To do that you have to let go of the idea of any kind of reward. You just have to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty \u2014 try not to think about approval and any kind of badge or gold star,\u201d he says.",
      "Ryan says he\u2019s been writing since he was 20. He\u2019s written things that \u201cdidn\u2019t pan out\u201d and novels he put away, which he calls \u201clearning curves.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only way I found to keep going over the years in the face of that kind of adversity was to let go of this idea of the prize and keep telling myself, 'You\u2019re doing this because you love to do it,'\u201d he says.",
      "While he wrote \u201cBuckeye,\u201d he looked at a note taped to his desk in his own handwriting: \u201cNo one asked you to write.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was how I had to be, and that was \u2014 that was how I got through. And so then to have that news come along, it was just nothing but happy tears. I just sort of cried happily,\u201d he says."

      "Amid excitement from fans about the doc, some social media users called out McDonald\u2019s appearance, with one comment on the trailer reading, \u201cWhat the heck did Emma do to her face!!!\u201d",
      "McDonald took the opportunity to address the comments about her appearance in an Aug. 27 Instagram post.",
      "\u201cWhen I watched the documentary back, I didn\u2019t feel good about how I looked,\u201d she admitted in the caption. \u201cAbout a month or two before filming (which was almost two years ago now), I had Botox and filler done. Looking back, I regret that choice.\u201d",
      "McDonald said she \u201cwasn\u2019t feeling \u2018perfect\u2019\u201d and saw \u201clittle things\u201d she wanted to fix. While she thought the procedures would help her, they made her look \u201cless like myself.\u201d",
      "She said that she didn't think anybody would notice the procedures and clarified that she hadn\u2019t experienced \u201ca medical issue or complication,\u201d but rather \u201ca lapse in judgment.\u201d",
      "\u201cThankfully, Botox wears off and fillers dissolve over time,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut interviews live forever online, and that version of me is now out there to stay.\u201d",
      "McDonald said the comments did \u201csting,\u201d adding, \u201cI may have once been an actress, but I don\u2019t live in that world anymore. I don\u2019t have a thick Hollywood skin\u2014I\u2019m just a person.\u201d",

      "\u201cIronically, the very things I tried to \u2018fix\u2019 with Botox and filler only magnified what I was insecure about,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to admit that in an era of \u2018self-love,\u2019 I didn\u2019t have much of it for myself in that moment.\u201d",
      "McDonald highlighted the lessons that she learned from the experience, telling fans, \u201cI\u2019d rather embrace my frown lines than look like I\u2019ve had \u2018too much Botox.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still a work in progress, but I\u2019m learning, and I\u2019m grateful,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my experience serves as a cautionary tale, then I\u2019m glad to share it. Or, if it simply reminds someone that perfection isn\u2019t found in changing ourselves but in owning who we are\u2014then it was worth writing this.\u201d",

      "\u201cVulnerability isn\u2019t easy, but in a world often ruled by optics, choosing honesty feels like the best path forward,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re all carrying battles unseen, and kindness makes the weight lighter for everyone.\u201d",
      "McDonald said that it was \u201cscary\u201d to be vulnerable but said the support she's received \u201chas been such a relief\u201d",

      "During the experience, which opened Aug. 28, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is projected onto the Sphere\u2019s 160,000 square-foot display, immersing the audience in nearly 360-degree visuals and sound.",

      "NBC News\u2019 Gadi Schwartz attended the experience reporting for TODAY and witnessed debris flying around the theater to bring to life the \u201cmonstrous tornado\u201d from the film.",
      "The audience is also engrossed in multi-sensory 4D elements during the film, including \u201chigh-velocity wind arrays, atmospheric fog, towering fire bursts, bubbles, and infrasound haptic seats,\" according to the Sphere's website.",
      "During one scene, in which Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Lion are being swarmed by flying winged monkeys, the audience appears to experience digitized versions of the creatures flying overhead.",
      "The Sphere even took the experience outside the physical venue \u2014 and up to the Las Vegas sky.",
      "Mimicking the Wicked Witch of the West writing a message to Dorothy using smoke in the sky, the Sphere shared an image of the line \u201cSURRENDER DOROTHY...OR DIE\u201d penned in puffs over the venue.",
      "Changes to \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019",
      "The Sphere experience also made some notable changes to play the film on its wraparound screen.",
      "First, the runtime. While \"The Wizard of Oz\" typically clocks in at around 102 minutes, the runtime for the Sphere show is 75 minutes.",
      "Then, there's the score. While the audience will hear Judy Garland\u2019s original vocals as Dorothy, the Sphere\u2019s version includes a re-recorded rendition of the original movie score for \u201cnew clarity.\u201d Sphere Studios separated the vocals from the instrumentals in the original tracks and used an orchestra to record a more detailed variation of the score, according to a video on the venue's official YouTube page.",
      "According to the Sphere, the new score transforms the original versions of songs like \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d into music better fit for the venue\u2019s 167,000 programmable speakers built into the seats.",
      "\u201cYou can actually feel the voice and effects,\u201d Carolyn Blackwood, head of Sphere Studios, said in the video. \u201cAnd with the 4D, you feel like you\u2019re there.\u201d",
      "The experience\u2019s producer, Jane Rosenthal, said in a video that their goal is to \u201cmaintain the integrity of the original filmmakers\u2019 intent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of our cultural history,\u201d Rosenthal added. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take it and do anything with it.\u201d",
      "The film was originally shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio, but the Sphere's screen is not a flat rectangle. To adapt the classic film, the team used artificial intelligence to make it fit the massive display and improve the resolution. Visual effects specialists took the original sets and \u201cextended them realistically beyond that based on the production design,\u201d producer and CEO of software design company Magnopus Ben Grossmann said in a video about the experience.",
      "He explained that, working with a team at Google, they broke down the original \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d frame by frame using super resolution, pinpointing how to enhance the 1930s shots.",
      "For example, several shots solely show a character from their waist to the top of their head. The team used character outpainting to restore the shots and transform into the large displays for the Sphere.",
      "Similarly, some of the original closeup shots with minimal background details are now wider shots, meaning they must show more of the set and additional characters. The team used \"performance generation\" technology to illustrate what characters could have been doing in the background.",
      "The use of AI for the project has come with some controversy. Some described the alteration of the original work as an offense to cinema.",
      "\u201chonestly this is the ugliest and most dishonorable thing to happen to classic cinema in years,\u201d one social media user said on X.",
      "A recent Variety review of the showing called the effects, \u201ccreepy, applied over existing footage in a way that clearly interferes with the humanity of the underlying performances \u2014 that is, if there was an underlying performance to begin with.\u201d",
      "USA Today, however, dubbed the show \"nothing short of extraordinary.\"",
      "On the Sphere\u2019s website, the venue details how it uses AI and said, \u201cThrough \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 at Sphere, Sphere is leading the way in applying AI and visual effects to bring new creative possibilities to the entertainment industry, and wonder to the world.\u201d",
      "How Much Are Tickets to 'The Wizard of Oz' at the Sphere?",
      "Depending on seating, tickets for the film range in price from about $109 to $149.",
      "There are also two VIP packages available: the Good Witch Premium Experience and the Bad Witch Ultimate VIP Experience.",
      "The Good Witch experience \u2014 which includes expedited entry, a food and beverage credit and premium seating \u2014 costs about $320. The Bad Witch experience includes everything from the Good Witch package in addition to pre-show lounge access and a poster, and costs about $370."

      "\u201cThey\u2019re incentivized by money but the use of Telegram and bitcoin creates plausible deniability and allows the Russians to keep their distance,\u201d Bailey said in a recent interview. \u201cIt hides the trail, be that a money trail or any of the connections.\u201d",
      "According to British prosecutors the trail that led to the warehouse burning in east London began in March 2024, when a 21-year-old British drug dealer named Dylan Earl initiated communications with an anonymous account on Telegram with the usernames \u201cPrivet Bot\u201d and \u201cLucky Strike.\u201d",
      "The account was run by an operative with the Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group that fought in Syria and Ukraine before it launched a short-lived mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2023 but has now been brought to heel by the Kremlin.",
      "Earl expressed interest in joining Wagner as a gun-for-hire, saying, \u201cI need a fresh start\u201d after his life of small-time crime in the U.K, according to documents released by prosecutors.",
      "But the Russian handler said Wagner had a different use for him: carrying out operations in Europe.",
      "Over the course of hundreds of messages, the Russian handler offered the young British criminal both money and ideological encouragement to burn down the warehouse, which could net him roughly $8,000.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll make you rich. And grant you things no one else can. Citizenships. Passports. Everything,\u201d the Russian handler said in a message posted on the Privet Bot account.  In another, the handler said, \u201cYou are our dagger in Europe.\u201d",
      "Earl was also encouraged to embrace a clandestine lifestyle by watching the FX show \u201cThe Americans\u201d about KGB spies operating undercover in the United States.",
      "\u201cLook how they describe Russia. But you see U.K. and USA,\u201d the handler wrote.  \u201cHomeless everywhere. Drugs etc. It is fearmongering bro. They want people scared.\u201d",
      "Earl knew he was dealing with a Wagner operative but did not back down.",
      "Within weeks of their initial messages, Earl had recruited a group of young accomplices to carry out the warehouse attack. According to prosecutors, only one of them \u2014 Jake Reeves, 23 \u2014 understood that they were starting the fire on Russian orders.",
      "Neither Earl nor Reeves was present when the fire was started by Nii Kojo Mensah, 23, Jakeem Rose, 21, and Ugnius Asmena, 23, all of whom were convicted of aggravated arson. Instead, they watched a livestream of the blaze on FaceTime provided by Asmena.",
      "The men who actually started the fire believed it was merely a criminal act \u2014 Earl never told them they were acting on Russian orders.",
      "British detectives stepped up the hunt after they realized they were most likely dealing with a Russian state-sponsored operation targeting the Ukrainian business. They arrested Earl in early April and after they accessed his phone, quickly established his connection to the Wagner group.",
      "Earl and Reeves both pleaded guilty to aggravated arson and offenses under British national security laws.",
      "There is no suggestion that they were linked to other attacks across Europe or the groups carrying them out.",
      "\u201cThis case is a clear example of an organization linked to the Russian state using 'proxies' \u2014 in this case British men \u2014 to carry out very serious criminal activity in this country on their behalf,\u201d Murphy, the Met counterterrorism head, said in a statement after the verdict.",
      "The suspected Russian-backed criminal attacks across Europe are usually unsophisticated intelligence operations. Many of the plots, like the one in London, involve arson.",
      "In June, a Colombian man was imprisoned for eight years in the Czech Republic after he was convicted of setting fire to buses in Prague. Like Earl, he was also given orders by a Russian handler over the Telegram messaging app and told to record himself setting the fire, according to Czech authorities.",
      "That type of attack is relatively low-risk for Russia, compared with sending its own professional agents into an increasingly hostile Europe.",
      "But there is some evidence that the Russian operative handling Earl had higher ambitions for his group of British gangsters-for-hire.",
      "British police said that at the time of their arrest they had already begun surveillance operations for their next plot: kidnapping a Russian dissident named Yevgeny Chichvarkin and setting fire to his Michelin-starred Hide restaurant in one of London\u2019s most expensive neighborhoods."

      "Trump said his family became interested in cryptocurrency when it was cut off from banking services \u201cbecause my father was in politics.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Bitcoin community embraced my father, unlike anything I had ever seen before,\u201d Trump said at the Bitcoin Asia conference here.",
      "\u201cAnd I hope that\u2019s paid off in spades, because we love this community,\u201d he said, sitting in front of a screen with a live ticker showing the cryptocurrency\u2019s price at nearly $110,000, up from about $70,000 on the day his father, Donald Trump, was voted back into office in November.",
      "Eric Trump has attracted an almost cult-like following in the crypto industry, which was apparent in Hong Kong as hundreds of attendees \u2014 some dressed up in outfits ranging from sparkly robes to white suits covered in Bitcoin symbols \u2014 cheered as Trump took the stage, bashed his father\u2019s predecessor, Joe Biden, and said, \u201cThis is the time to buy.\u201d",
      "The cryptocurrency industry has become big business for the Trump family, whose patriarch has become one of its biggest champions since it helped return him to office.",
      "Feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, the industry was a political force in the 2024 election season, directing an estimated $135 million in donations toward Trump and other crypto-friendly candidates.",
      "Since then, the Trump family has only become further enmeshed in the industry \u2014 no one more so than Eric Trump, who said Friday that \u201c90% of my time in life is in this community.\u201d",
      "His latest venture is called American Bitcoin. Launched in March with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., and the Nasdaq-listed Hut 8, a crypto energy infrastructure company, American Bitcoin aims to be the \u201cworld\u2019s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve,\u201d according to a news release.",
      "Eric Trump said Friday that the company will be going public \u201cvery soon\u201d as it merges with a pre-existing Nasdaq-listed company called Gryphon Digital Mining.",
      "\u201cWe are one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies on Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe mine about 3% of the world\u2019s Bitcoin every single day.\u201d",
      "He insists that the family\u2019s business is separate from national politics and has dismissed concerns about conflicts of interest.",
      "\u201cMy father\u2019s totally shielded off from our company. There\u2019s total separation of church and state,\u201d he told CNBC in December. \u201cWe have great ethics advisers. We take it incredibly seriously.\u201d",
      "But Donald Trump was a major topic of discussion at his son\u2019s Q&A in Hong Kong, which began with a round of applause for the president, who has vowed to make the United States the \u201ccrypto capital of the world.\u201d",
      "Since returning to office in January, Trump has pushed to ease regulation of the industry, shut down the Justice Department\u2019s national cryptocurrency enforcement team, appointed a \u201ccrypto czar\u201d and held a White House summit for industry leaders. He also said the U.S. would create a national strategic crypto reserve.",
      "This month he signed an executive order allowing cryptocurrency and real estate investments to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts, which critics say could put Americans\u2019 retirement savings at risk.",
      "Trump has also sought legislative backing for a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, some of which is already in place. One of the three bills that received support on Capitol Hill last month was the GENIUS Act, which allows stablecoins to be issued by private companies.",
      "The passage of the bills was slammed by Americans for Financial Reform, a left-leaning watchdog group, which said in a statement last month that Trump and his allies would \u201cpersonally benefit from limitless legalized corruption while the rest of us stand in harm\u2019s way of the next crypto implosion.\u201d",
      "Trump, who said in 2021 that Bitcoin \u201cseems like a scam,\u201d has since embraced it as a moneymaking opportunity, sometimes at great cost to investors. According to the watchdog group State Democracy Defenders Fund, as of mid-March his crypto assets were valued at $2.9 billion, or about 37% of his total wealth.",
      "Much of that money, which Trump earned in about six months, came from ventures such as the $TRUMP coin that he launched ahead of his inauguration, which was trading at nearly $8 on Friday, down from its peak of $73 in January. A meme coin was also launched for first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Industry professionals call these meme coins, meaning they have little practical use and are mostly symbolic, making their value subject to extreme volatility. About 764,000 wallets of mostly small holders lost money on $TRUMP while 58 wallets made more than $10 million each, CNBC reported in May, citing data from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.",
      "In May, Trump briefly appeared at a dinner outside Washington for the 220 largest buyers of $TRUMP, who spent an average of $1 million on the token.",
      "Trump also has a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized crypto exchange that was launched last fall and is majority-controlled by the Trump family.",
      "World Liberty\u2019s flagship project is its $WLFI stablecoin, which holders voted last month to make more widely tradable. The family also stands to gain from an agreement by a technology company backed by the government of the United Arab Emirates to invest $2 billion in one of World Liberty\u2019s stablecoin products.",
      "That currency will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, whose CEO stepped down in 2023 after the company pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges.",
      "The deal was announced at a crypto conference Eric Trump attended in Abu Dhabi shortly before his father visited the United Arab Emirates city in May.",
      "Even amid the enthusiasm at the Hong Kong conference on Friday, participants said there was some discomfort around the Trump family\u2019s involvement in the cryptocurrency industry.",
      "\u201cThere is serious conflict of interest, and people recognize it,\u201d said Bharat Prabhakar, 25, a New York-based conference attendee. \"But not a lot of people say it out loud because there\u2019s real consequences for it.\""

      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s flight landed safely in Bulgaria, just a short distance from Russian territory. But it has given a jolt to European fears over Moscow\u2019s suspected interference with Western signals.",
      "Once a background nuisance, the issue has surged into a mounting security concern \u2014 escalating in step with Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine \u2014 and has the continent scrambling to adapt.",
      "NATO 'working day and night'",
      "Bulgarian authorities later confirmed that the satellite signal guiding the plane\u2019s navigation system had been neutralized. The European Commission said Bulgaria suspected \u201cblatant interference by Russia.\u201d",

      "The disruption of von der Leyen\u2019s plane has thrust the issue into the spotlight at a time when Europe is already on edge over the war in Ukraine and its spillover effects.",

      "The Bulgarian Air Traffic Services Authority said there had been a \u201cnoticeable increase\u201d in GPS incidents, including jamming, since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "In June, 13 European Union member states raised the alarm over jamming and spoofing threats disrupting air and sea travel.",
      "According to an E.U. document, Poland logged 2,732 cases of interference in January 2025, up from 1,908 in late 2023. Lithuania recorded 1,185 cases in the same month, more than double the figure from March 2024.",

      "Germany\u2019s top military commander, Gen. Carsten Breuer, said Monday there had been a significant increase in GPS jamming incidents since the war in Ukraine began, adding that he had personally experienced it on two occasions, once over the Baltic Sea and again during a military exercise in Lithuania.",

      "A 'happy propaganda coup'?",
      "Open-source research tracing the origins of interference repeatedly points to two hot spots: Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad exclave, wedged between Poland and Lithuania, and the St. Petersburg area in western Russia. Both regions host a heavy concentration of Russian military units specializing in electronic warfare.",
      "In March 2024, a Royal Air Force plane carrying the U.K.\u2019s then\u2013defense secretary, Grant Shapps, also reported a spoofing incident, where false location data was fed to the aircraft\u2019s navigation systems.",
      "The plane, which had been flying near Kaliningrad, was able to continue its journey safely, but such tactics have in the past caused planes to veer off course.",
      "The incident with von der Leyen\u2019s plane occurred while she was on a four-day tour of E.U. member states that border Russia, Belarus or the Black Sea.",

      "Topping the guest list are Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has pressed on with his war against Ukraine despite a U.S. peace push, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a rare departure from his isolated, nuclear-armed state.",
      "Leaders from the United States and other Western governments have declined to attend the parade, partly because of the presence of Putin.",
      "It comes amid heightened military tensions in the region as China clashes with neighbors in the South China Sea and the U.S. and its allies brace for potential conflict over Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a show of force,\u201d said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s a means to show China\u2019s neighbors, other countries around the world, that China\u2019s military is formidable.\u201d",
      "The parade will showcase China\u2019s growing military power under Xi, who has overseen a modernization campaign as well as political purges of senior officials and even defense ministers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now become a much more capable force that is increasingly a near peer, if not a true peer, to the U.S. military in many respects,\u201d said Elsa B. Kania, a doctoral candidate at Harvard and an adjunct senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington that specializes in U.S. national security issues.",
      "China, whose annual defense spending is estimated to be about a third of the $1.3 trillion spent by the United States, has said its goal is for military modernization to be \u201cbasically complete\u201d by 2035, and for the Chinese military to be \u201cworld class\u201d by 2049, the 100th anniversary of communist rule.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is the only world-class military in the world, and we still have a need to catch up with the United States \u2014 and it will take time,\u201d Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing, told NBC News in an interview.",
      "\u201cBut I believe by 2049, which is still far away, we should be confident to reach the objective,\u201d said Zhou, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army.",
      "Confidence on display",
      "Security has been tight in Beijing in the weeks leading up to the parade, disrupting businesses and traffic. Tanks could be heard rolling down the streets during weekly overnight rehearsals that paralyzed the city center and were conducted with great secrecy.",
      "This is China\u2019s first military parade since 2019, when Beijing commemorated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and its third under Xi, who also held one in 2015 for the 70th anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender.",
      "The legacy of World War II is still a sensitive subject between Japan and China, which is estimated to have suffered between 20 million and 35 million military and civilian deaths during a 14-year Japanese invasion and occupation that China calls the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.",
      "The parade is aimed just as much at the Chinese public as it is at foreign adversaries, said Thompson, the former director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia at the U.S. Department of Defense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fanning anti-Japanese sentiments to increase the party\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of its own people,\u201d he said, particularly at a time when the Chinese public is concerned about a slowing economy.",
      "Japan, a key U.S. ally, has reportedly urged other countries not to attend, leading China to lodge a diplomatic complaint.",
      "According to the Chinese government, much of the equipment included in the 70-minute parade is being revealed for the first time.",
      "In addition to the troops, the parade will involve more than 100 aircraft and hundreds of ground armaments, all of them domestically made and battle-ready, officials said at an Aug. 20 news conference in Beijing.",
      "The \u201cnew-generation\u201d equipment on display \u201creflects a high degree of informatization and intelligence, underscoring our military\u2019s ability to adapt to technological advances and evolving warfare patterns, and to win future conflicts,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Wu Zeke, deputy director of the parade.",
      "Air and missile defense systems that could make an appearance include the HQ-19 and the more advanced HQ-26 and HQ-29, all of which are designed to intercept ballistic missiles and are believed to have capabilities similar to equivalent U.S. systems.",
      "Military observers are also watching for any new intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as new supersonic and hypersonic missiles.",
      "Such missiles \u201cpose a big threat for U.S. naval ships\u201d that would be central to any U.S. military intervention in the Asia-Pacific, said Shinji Yamaguchi, a senior research fellow in the China Studies Division at the Japanese government\u2019s National Institute for Defense Studies.",
      "China is also expected to display autonomous drones, which especially since the war in Ukraine have \u201creally changed the way of warfare,\u201d Yamaguchi said, as well as unmanned underwater vehicles, also known as sea drones.",
      "In a conflict, China could deploy sea drones in the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere \u201cto strengthen intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,\u201d Yamaguchi said.",
      "Jet fighters will also be in focus after Pakistan said it used Chinese-built J-10Cs to shoot down Indian aircraft during a four-day conflict in May.",
      "But while China has become more open about displaying weaponry as its confidence grows, it is difficult to know what is going on behind the scenes.",
      "The \u201cdramatic\u201d removal of officials \u201chas raised questions about Xi Jinping\u2019s trust in military leaders, or about whether systemic problems of corruption can be resolved,\u201d Kania said.",
      "There has also been little recent real-world demonstration of the actual capabilities of the Chinese military, whose last experience in a large-scale conflict was against Vietnam in 1979.",
      "\u201cNone of this has been tested. Nobody knows,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAnd this may be one of the reasons that China relies on this very conventional form of deterrence and signaling in the form of a parade.\u201d",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Janis Mackey Frayer from Beijing."

      "TIANJIN, China \u2014 A private car ride with Vladimir Putin may not be as special as President Donald Trump thought.",
      "With a backseat bromance of their own, as well as hand-holding and hugs, the Russian leader, his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and their host, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, put on a display Monday that seemed designed to turn heads in Washington.",
      "The three leaders staked out long-held positions in comments at this key regional summit in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, but the tenor and the timing of the trio's embrace was impossible to ignore.",
      "India, long courted by the West as a crucial Asian partner and counterweight to China, has been rattled by Trump\u2019s tariffs; the Kremlin has publicly brushed aside Washington's peace push in Ukraine; and Beijing continues to spar with the U.S. over trade, Taiwan and global influence.",
      "Amid this thicket of tensions, the cozy optics at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) gathering appeared a clear signal in the face of U.S. pressure.",
      "Weeks after Trump and Putin made headlines with a protocol-busting ride in \u201cThe Beast\u201d at their Alaska summit, Modi joined the Russian leader for a drive in the back of Putin's own armored limo \u2014 a not-so-subtle statement of defiance just days after the U.S. doubled tariffs on India to 50% as punishment for buying Russian oil.",
      "Russian state media reporter Pavel Zarubin said the pair spent nearly an hour in the car before proceeding to bilateral talks.",
      "\u201cI always feel that meeting you has been a memorable experience,\u201d Modi said to Putin later during the talks.",
      "The Russian leader called Modi his \"dear friend,\" espousing Russia and India's \"friendly and trusting\" relations.",
      "In a speech to delegates, Putin did say that \u201cunderstandings\u201d reached at his summit with Trump could form the basis for peace in Ukraine, but he gave little indication of a shift in his position and issued his customary rebuke blaming the West\u2019s \u201cconstant attempts to drag Ukraine into NATO\u201d for causing the war.",
      "'A totally one sided disaster!'",
      "Perhaps watching from Washington, Trump said Monday that the relationship between India and the U.S. had been \u201ca totally one sided disaster!\u201d and chided New Delhi for buying \u201cmost of its oil and military products from Russia,\u201d and \u201cvery little from the U.S.\u201d",
      "He said that India had now offered to cut their tariffs on U.S. goods to zero. \"But it's getting late,\" Trump added.",
      "Whether the theatrics in Tianjin were spontaneous or carefully planned, \u201cthe message remains the same,\u201d Keir Giles, a senior fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe close relationship that Trump sought with Putin is now on display between Putin and others,\u201d he said, adding that the U.S. had \"given India a real cause to look for friendship and partnership elsewhere.\"",
      "That friction had also given India a reason to \u201cmend fences\u201d with China, said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "India has \"lots of problems,\" with China, she said, \"but it is right on their border, and it\u2019s their largest trading partner in goods.\"",
      "Xi, for his part, criticized the \u201cbullying behavior\u201d from unnamed countries, a veiled reference to the U.S.",
      "He outlined his longstanding ambition to challenge the U.S.-led global economic and security order. \u201cWe must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics, and practice true multilateralism,\u201d he said, while laying out a new \u201cGlobal Governance Initiative\u201d that was short on concrete policies.",
      "Talking in Tianjin",
      "Much of this northeastern port city was on lockdown ahead of the summit, the biggest since the SCO\u2019s founding in 2001.",
      "China welcomed dozens of leaders from Eurasian member states and other partner and observer countries for talks on trade, energy cooperation and regional stability. Their motorcades brought car and pedestrian traffic to a halt, with the area around the sprawling event venue on lockdown and security stepped up at the city\u2019s train station.",
      "Security barriers and police-manned checkpoints were present throughout Tianjin, with authorities' usual caution exacerbated by a spectacular military parade set to take place Wednesday in nearby Beijing.",
      "Focus on the growing summit, part of China\u2019s long-running effort to challenge U.S. dominance, has only been amplified this year by global upheaval from Trump-era policies and other foreign policy shifts.",
      "India and China have long sparred over their Himalayan border, trade tensions and Beijing\u2019s support for India\u2019s rival, Pakistan.",
      "But shared grievances \u2014 including Trump\u2019s tariffs, which in China\u2019s case have reached as high as 145% \u2014 have helped carve out common ground.",
      "Against that backdrop, Modi\u2019s first visit to China in seven years and his apparent camaraderie with Xi and Putin appeared especially striking.",
      "While Modi joyously clasped Trump\u2019s hand during a massive rally in Texas in 2019, Indian media on Monday seized on his friendship with Putin as a message of defiance against the U.S.",
      "Indian television channel Republic World called it a \u201cbig diplomatic win\u201d for India, while a headline on news channel Aaj Tak ran \u201cTrump\u2019s dictator vs. Modi-Putin\u2019s friendship.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the Tianjin summit, the U.S. embassy in India highlighted that the partnership between the two nations \u201ccontinues to reach new heights,\u201d spanning \u201cinnovation and entrepreneurship, defense, and broader bilateral ties.\u201d",
      "But the message, from Modi as well as Xi and Putin, seemed clear: They may have differences, but they are ready to stand \u2014 or sit \u2014 together.",

      "PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 At least 800 people have been killed and more than 1,300 others injured in Afghanistan after a 6.0-magnitude earthquake hit the country, Taliban officials said Monday.",
      "The earthquake struck 17 miles from the eastern city of Jalalabad, near the border with Pakistan, at around midnight local time (3:30 p.m. ET Sunday), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Because the earthquake hit a remote mountainous area, \u201cit will take time to get the exact information about human losses and damage to the infrastructure,\u201d said Sharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for the Afghan Public Health Ministry.",
      "\u201cWe have launched a massive rescue operation and mobilized hundreds of people to help people in the affected areas,\u201d Zaman said.",
      "He called for international aid to tackle the devastation, which left rescue teams battling to reach remote areas and loved ones searching desperately through the rubble of homes.",
      "Construction quality is poor in rural Afghanistan, where buildings are often made of mud bricks and wood. Videos showed collapsed homes and rescuers combing for survivors. Injured people from these remote areas were seen being lifted on gurneys onto helicopters.",

Earlier, Interior Ministry spokesperson Mufti Abdul Matin Qani had said 622 people had been confirmed dead and more than 1,300 injured in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar, which includes Jalalabad and Kunar.",
      "The ministry said that 1,000 injured people had been evacuated and admitted to hospitals.",
      "A United Nations team was mobilized, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a post on X. Several U.N. organizations, including the Children's Fund, the World Health Organization, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Organization for Migration, said on X that they were providing emergency assistance.",

      "Victims watched as their homes collapsed before their eyes at night. One survivor, Sadiqullah, said, \"I was half-buried and unable to get out.\"",
      "Sadiqullah, who like other Afghans uses only one name, was awakened by what he described as a loud boom sound and rushed to grab his family, who were sleeping.",

      "\"My wife and two sons are dead and my father is injured and in hospital with me,\" he told The Associated Press. \"We were trapped for three to four hours until people from other areas arrived and pulled me out.\u201d",
      "Since the initial quake, at least five aftershocks ranging from 4.5 to 5.2 magnitude have hit the area throughout Monday, according to the U.S. Geological Service.",
      "Aftershocks can continue for days and can sometimes be worse than the first quake.",
      "Afghanistan is especially vulnerable to earthquakes as it sits on top of several fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian plates meet. The mountainous terrain of eastern Afghanistan is also prone to landslides, making it harder for emergency services to carry out rescues.",
      "This quake was especially devastating as it hit at a shallow depth of 5 miles, making it far more destructive even at moderate magnitude.",
      "In 2022, around 1,000 people were killed and thousands more were injured when a 5.9-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan.",
      "That, too, was a shallow quake.",
      "The following year, three 6.3-magnitude quakes hit the western Afghanistan province of Herat. The Taliban said around 4,000 people were killed, though the United Nations put the death tally at 1,500.",
      "Monday's quake comes at a challenging time for Afghanistan, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, which is suffering from four consecutive years of drought and the influx of over 2.3 million Afghans who have returned from Iran and Pakistan this year.",

      "Until last year, the U.S. provided nearly half of all humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. But under President Donald Trump, the U.S. has cancelled an estimated $1.7 billion of that support, according to a report filed to Congress in April by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.",

      "\u201cThe Indians saw this as a slap in the face for them,\u201d Mahbubani said. \u201cSo there is now, even as we are speaking, a tremendous amount of re-evaluation going on in Delhi about where India\u2019s place in the world is.\u201d",
      "At the same time, China and India have been moving cautiously to restore their relationship, reaching a deal to resolve their 2020 border standoff and announcing the resumption of direct flights.",
      "But not everybody is convinced about China extending a friendly hand, and the two countries still have major differences.",
      "One of the biggest is China\u2019s ties with Pakistan, India\u2019s archrival and a fellow nuclear power. During their conflict in May, Pakistan said it had used Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets to shoot down Indian military aircraft.",
      "\u201cThere was a huge step up in the kind of assistance that the Chinese were providing Pakistan, not merely in terms of selling them equipment and platforms, but on intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance,\u201d Gautam Bambawale, a former Indian ambassador to Beijing, said in an interview. \u201cSo we will go by actions on those things.\u201d",
      "Bambawale said it could take \u201cmonths, if not years\u201d for the relationship to return to where it was before 2020, let alone reach new heights.",
      "Though India and China are strong trading partners, that has not been enough to smooth over other diplomatic issues.",
      "Earlier this month, after a meeting in New Delhi between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, Beijing released a readout suggesting Jaishankar had acknowledged that Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy, \u201cis a part of China.\u201d",
      "When asked if Jaishankar made that statement, an Indian government official who was familiar with the discussions between the diplomats but not authorized to speak to the media, told NBC News that there was no change in India\u2019s position on Taiwan.",
      "\u201cWe stressed that like the rest of the world, India has a relationship with Taiwan that focuses on economic, technology and cultural ties,\u201d the official said.",
      "The clarification, which was also reported by Indian news organizations, prompted Beijing to double down, saying it was a \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with the facts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would seem that some people in India have tried to undermine China\u2019s sovereignty on the Taiwan question and impede the improvement of China-India relations,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.",
      "The two countries also have other border disputes, as well as a manufacturing rivalry that may only worsen as companies try to shift production from China. China, which is worried about technology transfer, has imposed curbs on the export of rare earth materials to India and recalled some of its nationals working in specialized roles.",
      "\u201cThe meeting between Modi and Xi will not remove the structural issues between India and China,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cBut the big issue for Xi outside of China now is U.S. pressure, and making sure India does not appear to be on the U.S. side is therefore significant.\u201d",
      "\u201cOn this occasion, optics does matter,\u201d he added."

      "Al-Rahawi is the most senior Houthi official to be killed since the United States and Israel began their air and naval campaign in response to the rebels\u2019 missile and drone attacks on Israel and on ships in the Red Sea. The U.S. and Israeli strikes killed dozens of people. One U.S. strike in April hit a prison holding African migrants in the northern Sadaa province, killing at least 68 people and wounding 47 others."

Compounded by the cost-of-living crisis and supercharged by social media, this is \u201cturning the chronic crisis of social disconnection into an acute threat of social division.\u201d",
      "Turvey hanging flags in his community then being struck by a Molotov cocktail saw those divisions flare into life. He was bandaged up, received stitches and gave a statement to the police, though he did not see his attackers and has not heard from officers since, he said.",

      "Indeed, polls show Labour at its lowest support since 2019, sinking to just 20% in a poll by YouGov this week. Farage\u2019s Reform party, meanwhile, has soared to 28%, according to the same top pollster, the highest of any party but not enough to govern without a coalition were a national vote held today. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has taken an increasingly hard rhetorical line on immigration.",
      "He is under pressure to deal with the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis, in which more than 50,000 people have arrived in small, unsafe vessels across the English Channel from France since he won a landslide election last year. Meanwhile, the government won a Supreme Court battle Friday so that asylum-seekers could continue being housed at a hotel in Epping, northeast of London, a site that has sparked numerous protests and counterprotests.",
      "Rumbling underneath all of this is the so-called grooming gangs scandal: the sexual exploitation of young women and girls by men in British towns and cities. A review in June that found that although most alleged perpetrators were white, in some areas there were higher rates of men of Asian and Pakistani heritage than their equivalent share of the population. At the same time, the review warned that many of those claiming outrage were merely trying \u201cto spread division and hate across communities.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere are probably one or two locations where it\u2019s organic and it started from below,\u201d Katwala, the director of British Future, said. \u201cThen there\u2019s another group \u2014 again, it\u2019s quite a small group \u2014 which is very politically radicalized, knows what it\u2019s doing and why it\u2019s doing it.\u201d"

    "summary": "Social media videos verified by NBC News show Colombian militant groups using drones for surveillance, intimidation and bombing campaigns.",
    "story": [
      "Through a monitor, two men watch a bomb tumble through the air toward a building at the edge of town. \u201cLook at how they run,\u201d one of the men says.",
      "The drone\u2019s camera follows a group of people below as they sprint down the road before the mortar explodes.",
      "These scenes of destruction, carried out and filmed by drones, have defined the war in Ukraine. But this drone is thousands of miles away in Colombia, the latest mutation in the country\u2019s deadly, long-standing conflict between the national government and militant groups.",
      "It\u2019s also an example of the growing use of drone warfare in Latin America and other parts of the globe.",
      "Seventeen videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show that these groups, the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), are using drones for surveillance, intimidation and bombing campaigns \u2014 targeting rival groups, soldiers, police and civilians across the country, injuring and killing dozens in the past year.",
      "Militants have focused their assaults on areas where they already possess greater control: in Catatumbo, a region of dense jungle bordering Venezuela, and Cauca, on Colombia\u2019s west coast, notorious for its smuggling routes in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "It was in Cauca last year in the town of El Plateado that a 10-year-old boy was killed by a grenade dropped from a drone onto a field during a soccer game. The boy, identified as \u201cDylan\u201d by Brig. Gen. Federico Mej\u00eda, commander of the armed forces in Cauca, was the first death from a drone strike in the country. Twelve others were injured in the explosion.",
      "The rate of strikes has rapidly accelerated since. \u201cEvery day they try and attack,\u201d Mej\u00eda said.",
      "In 2024, the Colombian Defense Ministry recorded 119 drone-related attacks. In 2025, attacks have doubled, with 180 incidents documented as of August.",
      "The sound of fear",
      "The drones \u2014 cheap, easy to operate and widely available online \u2014 are altered to carry explosives filled with nails, pieces of chainsaws and metal bolts, Mej\u00eda said. Used for surveillance and strikes, they can fly more than 1,000 feet above, making them virtually imperceptible to people on the ground.",
      "\u201cThe human ear can\u2019t hear it,\u201d said Secretary Luis Fernando Ni\u00f1o Lopez, high commissioner for peace in Norte de Santander, a region that encompasses Catatumbo. Drones, he said, have allowed militant groups to go beyond traditional battlefields and reach civilians.",
      "\u201cBefore, the war was body to body,\u201d Ni\u00f1o Lopez said. \u201cHowever, this changed to personal attacks, looking from house to house and using drones.\u201d",
      "In other instances, surveillance and intimidation go hand in hand. \u201cThe word is \u2018zumbido\u2019 (\u2018buzz\u2019),\u201d said Juanita Goebertus, director of the Americas Division at Human Rights Watch. In interviews the organization conducted with Indigenous communities in Catatumbo, residents described the \u201chumming sound\u201d from drones monitoring the population.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge fear created now in Catatumbo whenever there\u2019s the sound of a drone going around,\u201d she said.",
      "\u2018We can do that\u2019",
      "The adoption of drones marks the latest evolution in a conflict that has raged for over half a century in Colombia, experts said. In 2016, the government reached a peace agreement with the country\u2019s largest rebel group, FARC. The agreement was criticized from many sides, including some FARC militants who refused to disarm and continued operating in smaller numbers.",
      "With the reduction in their ranks, militant groups \u2014 no strangers to asymmetrical warfare \u2014 changed tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s a great example of a sort of criminal learning,\u201d Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said. \u201cThey see what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, the extremely broad use of drones. They think, \u2018Hey, we can do that.\u2019 Then one group starts in Colombia, and it spreads like wildfire.\u201d",
      "Over the past few years, videos emerged on social media of militants experimenting with store-bought drones. A video from 2023 shows fighters from a FARC dissident group testing the weight of a grenade tied to the body of a drone with a piece of string.",
      "\u201cOften, these munitions are very rudimentary,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cThe majority of attacks have been aimed at police or military targets or rival armed groups, but often they are exploding, obviously, in areas that affect civilians, because they are, by definition, an indiscriminate weapon.\u201d",
      "\u2018Drone comes, drone goes\u2019",
      "Civilians, especially children, in Cauca and Catatumbo have ended up on both ends of drone attacks. Last August, authorities arrested a 16-year-old who they said had operated a drone that dropped a bomb on a police building.",
      "\u201cYou see a lot of the guys who put together these drones, who run them being 16, 17, 18 years old,\u201d Dickinson said. Child recruitment in Colombia has soared in the past several years, she said, increasing over 1,000% between 2021 and 2024.",
      "Commercial drones are relatively simple to operate, and children, already predisposed to mastering new technology, are ideal targets for recruitment. \u201cMy son is 13 and manages a drone perfectly,\u201d Mej\u00eda said.",
      "Children in Colombia are increasingly vulnerable to the lures of militant groups, who have used social media apps like TikTok and WhatsApp to promote a glamorized version of the guerrilla lifestyle, according to experts, who also point to the absence of schoolteachers, many of whom have fled the violence in the region, as a contributing factor.",
      "A cycle of attacks, forced recruitment and instability has brought about Colombia\u2019s largest displacement from one region in at least 28 years. More than 73,000 people have fled Norte de Santander, according to the Ombudsman\u2019s Office of Colombia.",
      "For half a year, Jos\u00e9 del Carmen Abril, 55, known to his friends and family as Carmito, has been running for his life. The farmer and social leader from Catatumbo told NBC News he\u2019s a target of the ELN. In January, he was rescued by military police along with 19 other farmers after the rebel group launched several attacks against rival FARC dissidents. Speaking to Colombian media weeks after he was rescued, he said he was targeted due to his past in farmworker struggles and his previous support for the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica, a party linked with FARC.",
      "Now in hiding, Abril hears updates from his siblings and nephews who remain in Catatumbo.",
      "Drones, which at one time promised to be a technological advancement for farmers in Colombia, have become a symbol of terror.",
      "\u201cCatatumbo is becoming drone comes, drone goes,\u201d Abril said. \u201cThere is a fear of drones since farmers are military targets for the ELN.\u201d",
      "Amid the exchange of attacks from the ELN and FARC dissidents in the region, drones have dropped explosives on the homes of people in the countryside. In May, a 12-year-old and his mother were killed in Tib\u00fa when a drone dropped a grenade on their house, Abril said.",
      "\u2018A major risk for the future\u2019",
      "The military and government of Colombia have recently taken measures to stem the surge of drone attacks. The Defense Ministry has proposed a series of bills that would create a national registry for drones and classify strikes on civilians as terrorism.",
      "Soldiers have also started using anti-drone technology, devices that can locate unmanned aircraft and jam their signals. Since implementing these defenses, Mej\u00eda said, his forces have reduced the number of these attacks by 80% in Cauca.",
      "Devices for countering drones are by no means ubiquitous. Soldiers and police often try to shoot drones out of the sky, a relatively ineffective measure that creates its own public safety risks when they are shot down above crowded areas.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very hard to shoot down,\u201d said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIf you\u2019re a civilian living in rural Colombia, and there is a drone that can drop bombs from hundreds of feet above you or can fly in and detonate the explosive, you really have virtually no recourse.\u201d",
      "The country is facing another challenge to its ability to fight the rapidly evolving strategies and equipment of militant forces. At risk are hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid tied up in a certification process of the country\u2019s commitment to the war on drugs.",
      "Colombia has narrowly avoided decertification in past years, but it has failed to cut the illegal growth of coca crops, which has risen each year in the past decade, according to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.",
      "By Sept. 15, President Donald Trump will decide whether to cut off aid to Colombia. Cutting off the supply of resources and technologies to the country could cripple its efforts to fight militants in the future, said Alberto Jos\u00e9 Mej\u00eda Ferrero, a former general for Colombia\u2019s armed forces. He added that it would be \u201cvery bad for our strategy, for approach, and especially for the very, very strong relationship that the military forces of Colombia and our national police had with the U.S. for decades.\u201d",
      "The adoption of drone warfare by militant groups in Latin America is not unique to Colombia. Already, Mexican cartels have used drones to attack police and one another. In Ecuador, a drone targeted the roof of a high-security prison to force a jailbreak.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s a major risk for the future,\u201d Ziemer said. \u201cI think the region as a whole has yet to come to terms with the scale and potential scale of the threat we\u2019re seeing.\u201d"

      "The findings come as Reuters \u2014 whose cameraman Hussam al-Masri was among five journalists killed Monday in the Israeli strikes \u2014 said the Israeli military was \u201cfully aware\u201d that its team and other journalists were operating from the hospital in southern Gaza.",
      "The agency told NBC News on Wednesday that it had offered daily live feeds to its news clients from that location in recent weeks, but earlier in the war had stopped sharing its teams' exact locations \u201cafter so many journalists were killed in IDF strikes.\u201d",
      "What initially appeared to be a \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike \u2014 a tactic in which a target is hit, then struck again often after first responders have rushed in \u2014 was in fact more extensive.",
      "Al-Masri\u2019s live feed freezes at 10:08 a.m. local time but there\u2019s no video of the first strikes. Video of the aftermath of these hits shows smoke billowing from two separate staircases: the one where journalists were working and a second, around the corner next to the intensive care unit.",
      "Al-Masri was killed in the first strike.",
      "Minutes later, at 10:17 a.m., after journalists and first responders arrived on the staircase used by journalists \u2014 including men carrying a gurney seen on video wearing clearly identifiable high visibility vests \u2014 a second strike hits.",
      "Video obtained and verified by NBC News shows two additional projectiles striking the fourth-floor staircase within milliseconds of each other. Plumes of smoke can be seen rising from all affected areas.",
      "N.R. Jenzen-Jones, director of the arms intelligence firm Armament Research Services, said video of the incident after the first strike pointed to a direct-fire weapon, with damage \u201cconsistent with that expected from a multi-purpose tank gun projectile.\u201d",
      "Video of the second strike also appeared to show two projectiles, he said. Their flight pattern and \u201cbright emission\u2026 more likely to be from a tracer\u201d suggested they came from tank rounds, Jenzen-Jones said. The timing, he added, implies \u201ctwo tanks may have fired on the target simultaneously.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not respond to a request for comment on the newest revelations. The IDF has not provided NBC News with any additional information since it released preliminary findings on Tuesday.",
      "In its initial inquiry, the IDF said troops had identified a camera at the hospital \u201cpositioned by Hamas\u201d that was being used to observe its activity. It added that \u201ctroops operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera.\u201d",
      "But according to multiple eyewitnesses on the ground, including journalists and doctors at the hospital, there was only one camera positioned on the roof of the hospital: al-Masri\u2019s Reuters camera.",

      "According to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, heads of state and government from 26 countries will be at the parade, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. North Korean state media also confirmed that Kim was attending the parade at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "The United States and its allies are staying away from the event, partly out of protest over the presence of Putin, who faces an outstanding arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court over alleged war crimes in his war against Ukraine.",

      "China-North Korea ties have been strained in recent years by North Korea\u2019s growing partnership with Russia, where North Korea has sent artillery and troops to support Moscow in its war against Ukraine. Experts say that in exchange Russia may be providing advanced military technology that North Korea could use for its weapons programs.",
