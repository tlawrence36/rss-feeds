      "NEW YORK -- The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant \u2014 and he may once again make history at the 2026 Grammy Awards.",
      "The artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio is up for six awards at the Feb. 1 show, becoming the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for album, song and record of the year simultaneously. His critically acclaimed album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d is only the second Spanish-language record to be nominated for album of the year. The first? Well, that also belonged to Bad Bunny, 2022\u2019s \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti.\u201d",
      "Win or lose, experts say Bad Bunny's Grammy nominations mark a symbolic moment for Latinos. Just a week later, after all, he'll headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "Vanessa D\u00edaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of \u201cP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance,\u201d says Bad Bunny's nods extend beyond his own art and serve as a \u201cvery welcome recognition of Latin music that is growing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMusic from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean has been shaping global music tastes since the 19th century,\u201d adds Albert Laguna, associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale. \u201cBad Bunny is another link in a much longer chain of the popularity of Caribbean music on a global stage.\u201d",
      "Much of this music \u2014 particularly Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n, the genres Bad Bunny got his start in and continues to use in his new work \u2014 has been historically criminalized in Puerto Rico, not unlike hip-hop in the United States. Reggaet\u00f3n in particular, D\u00edaz points out, \u201ccomes from the most marginalized communities in Puerto Rico. And so, the fact that Bad Bunny is receiving nominations in three main categories, and this is an artist who came up with trap \u2026 is the most groundbreaking thing about the entire situation.\u201d",
      "Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of \u201cP FKN R,\u201d says that element is particularly noteworthy because institutions often ignore marginalized genres \u2014 including at the Latin Grammys, a sister award show to the Grammys.",
      "A victory in the major categories could have \u201cprofound, symbolic meaning,\u201d she says. But with a caveat: \u201cI\u2019m interested to see if this is going to open doors for other people.\u201d After all, Bad Bunny himself isn't immune to the Recording Academy\u2019s institutional biases: He already has three career Grammys, but all have been in m\u00fasica urbana categories \u2014 despite the fact that he is the most streamed artist on the planet.",
      "Across \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d Bad Bunny and his producers weave traditional Puerto Rican folkloric styles into a hyper-contemporary context. Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n aren't abandoned but fused with m\u00fasica j\u00edbara, salsa, bomba, plena and even aguinaldo, a kind of Christmas music, in \u201cPitorro de Coco.\u201d While Bad Bunny\u2019s previous albums also fused different genres \u2014 including bossa nova, mambo, rock, merengue and more \u2014 this album\u2019s melange was more homegrown.",
      "Laguna sees \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d as a direct challenge to the prevailing \u201cformula for global pop stardom,\u201d which he describes as an artist making it locally, gaining traction and then \u201cwatering down\u201d their sound into something commercial and palatable for a global audience.",
      "\u201cBad Bunny went in the opposite direction. It\u2019s his most Puerto Rican album ever,\u201d says Laguna. He hopes it will communicate to other artists that they, too, can look to their ancestry and history for artmaking.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much amazing Latin music that has been overlooked and that\u2019s part of what is so beautiful about this moment,\u201d says D\u00edaz. \u201cAnd that's why it feels like a win for all Latinos.\u201d",
      "The timing of the album's release and recognition, too, feels consequential. \u201cThe U.S. has a history of othering Latinos, othering the Spanish language. \u2026 We\u2019re in a moment where that feels extremely acute,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor a community that is being targeted on such a deep level, it is a little bit of light, a little bit of faith that we can still carve out our place here.\u201d",

      "Latinos and the Spanish-speaking community in the U.S. have grown increasingly wary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants.",
      "In an interview with i-D Magazine earlier this year, Bad Bunny mentioned that concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos factored into his decision not to tour in the continental U.S. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico itself since large-scale arrests began in late January.)",
      "\u201cThe content of the lyrics \u2014 which are so steeped in the history of Puerto Rico, political histories, tourism and gentrification \u2014 there\u2019s so much rich political and historical content,\u201d D\u00edaz adds. \u201cThis album is historic even without a Grammy win.\u201d",
      "But if Bad Bunny does win, D\u00edaz says, it will be \u201cakin to Halle Berry being the first Black woman to win an Oscar. That was a watershed moment. Or Rita Moreno being the first Latina to win.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, Laguna says the politics of the album are not exclusive to Puerto Rican or even Latino identity \u2014 \u201cthe lyrics on this album align with global struggles,\u201d he says. Take, for example, \u201cLo que le pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for cultural autonomy in an era of neocolonialization.",
      "Rivera-Rideau says one of the reasons \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d has resonated is not just the political implications of using folkloric music in addition to m\u00fasica urbana, but its sound. The traditional genres are \u201ca lot more digestible\u201d to listeners who embrace the antiquated taboos surrounding Latin trap and scoff at reggaet\u00f3n's sexuality. As a result, the combination of sounds makes for an album that is \u201cpopular across generations,\u201d she says.",
      "But it only works because it is \u201cmusically really interesting. If it was just traditional music, and that's only what people cared about, it wouldn't have done as well as it did,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusically, it is super innovative and makes accessible a lot of these older genres that people in Puerto Rico listen to, but he\u2019s been able to globalize these very local genres in a way that no one else has.\u201d",
      "That intergenerational appeal was a feature of Bad Bunny's landmark Puerto Rican residency, with the age and global diversity of its audience.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel like this is a tense moment, it\u2019s a difficult moment. And here\u2019s someone giving us a sonic language in which to narrate this complex present,\u201d Laguna says. \u201cThere's pleasure, in political critique, that the music makes possible in a beautiful way. And I think that's very much welcomed.\u201d",

      "The overhaul is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases, down from 18 a year ago.",
      "The changes comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising.",

      "\u2014 PCV or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",
      "However, many European countries recommend some of the vaccines the U.S. removed from its list.",
      "The nation's large doctors' groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, say they will continue to recommend the vaccines that the Trump administration has now demoted. They said there was no new science that warranted the changes, including no signs that the former U.S. vaccine schedule harmed children.",
      "Dr. Sean O'Leary of the AAP said the changes could increase child illness and death from preventable disease. He voiced special concern that the U.S. would no longer recommend flu vaccine for children, just as the flu season is becoming severe and after last winter's particularly harsh season.",
      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own child vaccine recommendations. Also, states, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "It's not yet clear. Because of the countering recommendations from pediatricians, doctor visits may not change. However, medical specialists say when the U.S. government doesn't explicitly recommend a shot, it will raise questions among parents, leading to more difficult conversations at the doctor's office.",
      "If the changes mean fewer children are vaccinated, outbreaks that have historically been prevented by high vaccination rates could spread more widely, leading to more disease and more missed school and work.",
      "The Trump administration said coverage will continue for families that still want the shots. Health insurers generally find vaccination a good deal, as shots are cheaper than hospitalizations, and many had previously said they'd planned to cover what was recommended last year through 2026.",

      "The U.S. has taken the unprecedented step of dropping the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups say would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of cutting the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases.",
      "The change is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases. What's no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high risk, or when doctors recommend them in what's called \u201cshared decision-making.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won't result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the decision creates confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.",
      "States, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "The change comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",
      "\u201cThis decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Monday.",
      "Trump, reacting to the news on his Truth Social platform, said the new schedule is \u201cfar more reasonable\u201d and \u201cfinally aligns the United States with other Developed Nations around the World.\u201d",
      "Among those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are vaccines against measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and human papillomavirus, or HPV. The guidance reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against HPV from two or three shots depending on age to one for most children.",
      "Medical experts said Monday's changes without what they said was public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.",
      "\u201cAbandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\u201d said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just copy and paste public health and that\u2019s what they seem to be doing here,\u201d said O\u2019Leary. \u201cLiterally children's health and children's lives are at stake.\u201d",
      "Most high-income countries recommend vaccinations against a dozen to 15 serious pathogens, according to a recent review by the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group that works to safeguard vaccine use.",
      "France today recommends all children get vaccinated against 14 diseases, compared to the 11 that the U.S. now will recommend for every child under the new schedule.",

      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own childhood vaccine schedule that its members are following, and it continues to broadly recommend vaccines that the Trump administration demoted.",
      "O'Leary singled out the flu vaccine, which the government and leading medical experts have long urged for nearly everyone starting at age 6 months. He said the government is \u201cpretty tone deaf\u201d for ending its recommendation while the country is at the beginning of a severe flu season, and after 280 children died from flu last winter, the most since 2009.",
      "Even a disease that parents may not have heard of, rotavirus, could come roaring back if vaccination erodes, he added. That diarrheal disease once hospitalized thousands of children each winter, something that no longer happens.",
      "The decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.",
      "The officials added that the new recommendations were a collaborative effort between federal health agencies but wouldn\u2019t specify who was consulted.",
      "Scientists at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases were asked to present to the agency\u2019s political leadership about vaccine schedules in other countries in December, but they were not allowed to give any recommendations and were not aware of any decisions about vaccine schedule changes, said Abby Tighe, executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, an advocacy organization of current and former CDC employees and their supporters.",
      "\u201cChanges of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, of the American Medical Association. \u201cThe scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies.\u201d",
      "The move comes as Kennedy, a longtime activist against vaccines, has repeatedly used his authority in government to translate his skepticism about the shots into national guidance.",
      "In May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women \u2014 a move immediately questioned by public health experts who saw no new data to justify the change.",
      "In June, Kennedy fired an entire 17-member CDC vaccine advisory committee \u2014 later installing several of his own replacements, including multiple vaccine skeptics.",
      "Kennedy in November also personally directed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying any new evidence to support the change.",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cThat is frightening,\u201d said Munodawafa. \u201cFor such a small population, those numbers are alarming.\u201d",

      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers.

      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV on Tuesday closed out the Vatican\u2019s 2025 Holy Year by denouncing today's consumerist and anti-foreigner sentiment, capping a Jubilee that saw some 33 million pilgrims flock to Rome and a historic transition from one American pontiff to another.",
      "With cardinals and diplomats looking on, Leo kneeled down in prayer on the stone floor at the threshold of the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica. He then stood up and pulled the two doors shut, symbolically concluding the rarest of Jubilees: one that was opened by a feeble Pope Francis in December 2024, continued during his funeral and the conclave, and then was closed by Francis' successor a year later.",
      "Only once before, in 1700, has a Holy Year been opened by one pope and closed by another.",
      "Tuesday's ceremony, at the start of Mass celebrating the feast of Epiphany, capped a dizzying year of special audiences, Masses and meetings that dominated Leo\u2019s first months as pontiff and in many ways put his own agenda on hold.",
      "As if to signal his pontificate now can begin in earnest, Leo has summoned the world\u2019s cardinals to the Vatican for two days of meetings starting Wednesday to discuss governing the 1.4-billion strong Catholic Church. On the agenda is the issue of the liturgy, suggesting Leo is diving head-first into the divisions within the church over the celebration of the old Latin Mass.",
      "In his homily Tuesday, Leo said the Jubilee year had invited all Christians to reflect on the Biblical teachings to welcome the stranger and resist \u201cthe flattery and seduction of those in power.\u201d",
      "\u201cAround us, a distorted economy tries to profit from everything,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us ask ourselves: has the Jubilee taught us to flee from this type of efficiency that reduces everything to a product and human beings to consumers? After this year, will we be better able to recognize a pilgrim in the visitor, a seeker in the stranger, a neighbor in the foreigner, and fellow travelers in those who are different?\u201d",
      "He echoed the theme in a special Epiphany prayer delivered from the basilica loggia to a rain-soaked piazza below. As thousands of people huddled under colorful umbrellas and ponchos, Leo recalled that traditionally Jubilees have included appeals for peace and \u201ca redistribution of the land and its resources\u201d to those in need.",
      "\u201cIn the place of inequality, may there be fairness, and may the industry of war be replaced by the craft of peace,\u201d he said.",
      "For the Vatican, a Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of the faithful making pilgrimages to Rome every 25 years to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and receive indulgences for the forgiveness of their sins if they pass through the Holy Door.",
      "For Rome, it\u2019s a chance to take advantage of public funds, in this case some 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion), to carry out long-delayed projects to lift the city out of years of neglect and bring it up to modern, European standards.",

Even then, the number of pilgrims was so significant that Dante referred to them in his \u201cInferno.\u201d",
      "Massive public works projects have long accompanied Holy Years, including the creation of the Sistine Chapel (commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475) and the big Vatican garage (for the 2000 Jubilee under St. John Paul II).",
      "Some works have been controversial, such as the construction of Via della Conciliazione, the broad boulevard leading to St. Peter\u2019s Square. An entire neighborhood was razed to make it for the 1950 Jubilee.",
      "The main public works project for the 2025 Jubilee was an extension of that boulevard: A pedestrian piazza along the Tiber linking Via della Conciliazione to the nearby Castel St. Angelo, with the major road that had separated them diverted to an underground tunnel.",
      "Leo has already announced that the next Jubilee will be in 2033, to commemorate what Christians believe was the A.D. 33 death and resurrection of Christ.",

      "HELSINKI -- The battle against fake news in Finland starts in preschool classrooms.",
      "For decades, the Nordic nation has woven media literacy, including the ability to analyze different kinds of media and recognize disinformation, into its national curriculum for students as young as 3 years old. The coursework is part of a robust anti-misinformation program to make Finns more resistant to propaganda and false claims, especially those crossing over the 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with neighboring Russia.",
      "Now, teachers are tasked with adding artificial intelligence literacy to their curriculum, especially after Russia stepped up its disinformation campaign across Europe following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago. Finland's ascension into NATO in 2023 also provoked Moscow's ire, though Russia has repeatedly denied it interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.",
      "\u201cWe think that having good media literacy skills is a very big civic skill,\u201d Kiia Hakkala, a pedagogical specialist for the City of Helsinki, told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to the nation\u2019s safety and to the safety of our democracy.\u201d",
      "At Tapanila Primary School, in a quiet neighborhood north of Helsinki, teacher Ville Vanhanen taught a group of fourth graders how to spot fake news. As a TV screen beamed a \"Fact or Fiction?\" banner, student Ilo Lindgren evaluated the prompt.",
      "\u201cIt is a little bit hard,\u201d the 10-year-old admitted.",
      "Vanhanen said his students have been learning about fake news and disinformation for years, beginning with reading headlines and short texts. In a recent class, the fourth graders were tasked with coming up with five things to look out for when consuming online news to ensure it\u2019s trustworthy. Now they are moving onto AI literacy, which is quickly becoming a vital skill.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been studying how to recognize if a picture or a video is made by AI,\u201d added Vanhanen, a teacher and vice principal at the school.",
      "Finnish media also play a role, organizing an annual \u201cNewspaper Week,\u201d where papers and other news are sent to young people to consume. In 2024, Helsinki-based Helsingin Sanomat collaborated on a new \u201cABC Book of Media Literacy,\u201d distributed to every 15-year-old in the country as they began upper secondary school.",

Those demonstrations pressured the fatally ill ruler of the country, the autocratic Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who ultimately fled the country.

This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst.

      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",

      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers.

      "President Donald Trump has again raised the idea of acting against Mexican drug cartels, but Mexico and analysts doubt unilateral U.S. military action",
      "MEXICO CITY -- After the United States military intervention in Venezuela, the Mexican government and analysts discounted the likelihood of unilateral U.S. military action against Mexican drug cartels, despite threats from President Donald Trump.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration has been complying with Washington's demands and the economic ties between the two countries are vital, they say.",
      "Nonetheless, many expect more such threats as a way to extract more concessions from Mexico. No one dares rule out completely an unexpected move by the U.S. president.",
      "Sheinbaum downplayed the possibility of U.S. military action Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t see risks (of that),\u201d she said. \u201cThere is coordination, there is collaboration with the United States government.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe in (the possibility of) invasion, I don\u2019t believe even that it\u2019s something they are taking seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cOrganized crime is not taken care with (foreign military) intervention.\u201d",
      "Here are some of the reasons:",
      "Mexico has a radically different situation from that of Venezuela or other countries Washington is eying, like Cuba. First, Sheinbaum is a popular and legitimately elected president. Second, Mexico is the main commercial partner of the United States, a country where 40 million Mexicans live. Third, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u201chas recognized that there is high-level cooperation with Mexico,\u201d said Martha B\u00e1rcena, former Mexican ambassador to the United States.",
      "Trump and his collaborators have flirted with the idea of invading or attacking the cartels in Mexico since his election campaign, but in increasingly measured tones.",
      "Sheinbaum has confirmed that the idea of U.S. military intervention in Mexico has been brought up repeatedly in her conversations with Trump, but said she has always rejected the offer. She sees it has a non-starter and insists that her relationship with Trump is one of mutual respect.",
      "The threat though, similar to those about tariffs on Mexican imports \u2014 some carried out and others not \u2014 have been a \u201cnegotiation weapon\u201d to get \u201ccommercial, diplomatic and political advantages,\u201d said Mexican security analyst David Saucedo. Rubio and Trump \"play good cop, bad cop,\u201d with Trump threatening and Rubio smoothing over, he said.",
      "Mexico is doing almost everything that Washington has requested since Trump began imposing tariffs, experts say. Sheinbaum\u2019s administration became more aggressive toward the cartels than her predecessor. There have been more arrests, drug seizures and extraditions. Mexico has agreed to receive more deportees from other countries.",

That would be a great risk to the U.S. because it would be left without a partner to work with, he added.",
      "Saucedo said that U.S. military action in Mexico would require money, logistics and risks, while \u201ca comment, a post on social networks doesn\u2019t cost anything\u201d and has been very effective.",

      "Saucedo said Trump could demand more access for U.S. security agencies, even if operations are presented publicly as coordinated and carried out by Mexico. He could also pressure Mexico for more high-profile captures or to stop exporting oil to Cuba, or threaten new tariffs.",
      "\u201cWith the ongoing negotiations over punitive tariffs, the statutory revision of the USMCA and the delicate antidrug cooperation agenda, the Mexican government will have to be very meticulous in its position and statements,\u201d Arturo Sarukh\u00e1n, another former Mexican ambassador to the U.S. said. Rallying around Maduro \u201cwould cost Mexico dearly,\u201d as could Mexico\u2019s ongoing support of Cuba.",

      "The top bidder for the prized tuna at the predawn auction on Monday was Kiyomura Corp., whose owner Kiyoshi Kimura runs the popular Sushi Zanmai chain. Kimura, who has won the annual action many times in the past, broke the previous record of 334 million yen ($2.1 million) he set in 2019.",

      "Pipeline safety regulators on Monday assessed their largest fine ever against the company responsible for leaking 1.1 million gallons of oil into the Gulf off the coast of Louisiana in 2023. But the $9.6 million fine isn\u2019t likely to be a major burden for Third Coast to pay.",
      "This single fine is close to the normal total of $8 million to $10 million in all fines that the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration hands out each year. But Third Coast has a stake in some 1,900 miles of pipelines, and in September, the Houston-based company announced that it had secured a nearly $1 billion loan.",
      "Pipeline Safety Trust Executive Director Bill Caram said this spill \u201cresulted from a company-wide systemic failure, indicating the operator\u2019s fundamental inability to implement pipeline safety regulations,\u201d so the record fine is appropriate and welcome.",
      "\u201cHowever, even record fines often fail to be financially meaningful to pipeline operators. The proposed fine represents less than 3% of Third Coast Midstream\u2019s estimated annual earnings,\u201d Caram said. \u201cTrue deterrence requires penalties that make noncompliance more expensive than compliance.\u201d",
      "The agency said Third Coast didn't establish proper emergency procedures, which is part of why the National Transportation Safety Board found that operators failed to shut down the pipeline for nearly 13 hours after their gauges first hinted at a problem. PHMSA also said the company didn't adequately assess the risks or properly maintain the 18-inch Main Pass Oil Gathering pipeline.",

Information widely available within the industry suggested that land movement related to hurricane activity was a threat to pipelines.\u201d",
      "The NTSB said the leak off the coast of Louisiana was the result of underwater landslides, caused by hazards such as hurricanes, that Third Coast, the pipeline owner, failed to address despite the threats being well known in the industry.",
      "A Third Coast spokesperson said the company has been working to address regulators' concerns about the leak, so it was taken aback by some of the details the agency included in its allegations and the size of the fine.",
      "\u201cAfter constructive engagement with PHMSA over the last two years, we were surprised to see aspects of the recent allegations that we believe are inaccurate and exceed established precedent. We will address these concerns with the agency moving forward,\" the company spokesperson said.",

      "Protesters angry over Iran's ailing economy have conducted a sit-in at Tehran's Grand Bazaar",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Protesters angry over Iran's ailing economy conducted a sit-in Tuesday at Tehran's Grand Bazaar, witnesses said, with security forces ultimately firing tear gas and dispersing demonstrators as the rest of the market shut down.",
      "The protest at the Grand Bazaar, the beating heart for centuries of both Iran's economic and political life, represents the latest signal that the demonstrations likely are to continue as the country's rial currency fell to a record low Tuesday. Already, violence surrounding the protests has killed at least 35 people with authorities detaining more than 1,200 others, activists abroad say.",
      "Meanwhile, the situation is likely to worsen as Iran's Central Bank drastically reduced the subsidized exchange rates for dollars it offers to importers and producers in the country. That likely will see merchants pass on price hikes in the coming days for goods directly onto consumers, whose life savings already have dwindled over years of international sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, while ordering a government investigation into one incident involving the protests, otherwise signaled Tuesday the crisis may be rapidly moving beyond the control of officials.",
      "\u201cWe should not expect the government to handle all of this alone,\" Pezeshkian said in a televised speech. \"The government simply does not have that capacity.\u201d",
      "In the Grand Bazaar, a labyrinth-like warren of covered passages and alleyways, demonstrators sat down in one passage in front of security forces as other shops nearby shut down on Tuesday, online videos showed and witnesses said. Other demonstrations similarly have seen people sit down in front of police after a photo circulated earlier of a man seen sitting alone in front of security forces.",
      "Authorities later fired tear gas to disperse the protesters. Iranian state-run media did not immediately acknowledge the incident, which has been common in the days since the demonstrations began on Dec. 28.",
      "Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel in June, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran\u2019s theocracy.",
      "On Tuesday, $1 traded at 1.46 million rials, a new low, with no signs of slowing. Prior to Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials.",
      "More pain may be coming for Iranian consumers. Iran\u2019s Central Bank in recent days greatly reduced a preferential, subsidized dollar-rial exchange rate. Iran\u2019s government offer that rate to importers and producers to try to ensure the flow of food, medicine and other essential goods despite international sanctions over its nuclear program and other issues.",
      "However, many of those firms took advantage of the difference in rates, pocketing ever-greater profits as normal Iranians watched their savings rapidly lose value against the dollar. That's led to the Central Bank drastically reducing that rate.",
      "The currency and rate depreciation has directly impacted what's available in stores \u2014 and at what price. The average bottle of cooking oil just doubled in price, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Many have complained about shelves being empty in stores, likely as suppliers and merchants fear selling cooking oil at a loss. Cheese and chicken prices also spiked, while imported rice hasn't been available in some shops.",
      "Pezeshkian in his speech blamed inflation, sanctions and other woes for causing the depreciation \u2014 and warned tougher times may be coming.",

It said 29 protesters, four children and two members of Iran\u2019s security forces have been killed. Demonstrations have reached over 250 locations in 27 of Iran\u2019s 31 provinces,",

      "The growing death toll carries with it the chance of American intervention. U.S. President Donald Trump warned Iran on Friday that if Tehran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters,\u201d the United States \u201cwill come to their rescue.\u201d Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday said \u201crioters must be put in their place.\u201d",
      "While it remains unclear how and if Trump will intervene, his comments sparked an immediate, angry response, with officials within the theocracy threatening to target American troops in the Mideast. The comments took on new importance after the U.S. military on Saturday captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran.",

      "The broader market is poised to gain even more ground as last year's momentum continues with growing corporate earnings and several other factors, according to Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide.",
      "\u201cThe market\u2019s broad, confident and consistent march upward, and the absence of emotion-based selling, tells you we\u2019re starting the year on pretty solid footing,\u201d Hackett wrote, in a note to investors.",

      "Bitcoin rose to its highest level since mid-November, hitting $94,700. Coinbase jumped 7.8% and Robinhood Markets jumped 7% for two of the markets biggest gains.",
      "Treasury yields fell in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.15% from 4.19% late Friday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves more closely with expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do, fell to 3.45% from 3.48% late Friday.",

The services sector makes up the bulk of the U.S. economy and it grew, even if only slightly, throughout most of 2025.",
      "Reports on the job market later this week, which include updates for job openings and overall employment, will be a bigger focus for the Fed. The central bank has been weighing a slowing job market against risks for rising inflation as it decides whether to cut interest rates. It cut its benchmark rate three times late in 2025, but inflation has remained above its 2% target and that has made the Fed more cautious.",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cThat is frightening,\u201d said Munodawafa. \u201cFor such a small population, those numbers are alarming.\u201d",

      "Zimbabwe's crisis mirrors a wider African pattern. Road accidents here kill about 300,000 people annually, about a quarter of the global toll. The continent has the world\u2019s highest fatality rate at 26.6 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with a global average of about 18, according to the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa. This is despite the continent of 1.5 billion people accounting for just about 3% of the global vehicle population.",
      "Road traffic deaths in Africa are also rising quicker than in any other region, with fatalities jumping 17% between 2010 and 2021, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s latest Africa road safety report released in mid-2024.",
      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",
      "In Uganda, where unregulated motorcycles dominate transport, reckless overtaking and speeding caused 44.5% of crashes in 2024, police there say, while in neighboring Kenya and across East Africa, frequent accidents on poor roads and dangerous driving fuel repeated calls for tougher road safety rules.",
      "To increase road safety, police in Zimbabwe have recently acquired body cameras and breathalyzers and are pushing for a review of the driver licensing system, including docking points for offenders and a revamp of driver training programs to highlight the dangers of reckless driving.",
      "\u201cDrivers are not licensed to be killers, they are licensed to practice road safety and safeguard lives on the road but sadly that is not the case,\u201d said police spokesperson Paul Nyathi.",
      "For instructors like Muvhevhi, survival has become the lesson.",
      "\u201cWhen we are teaching our students, it\u2019s no longer an issue of just obtaining the driver\u2019s license,\u201d he said. \u201cWe teach them to stay alive in spite of incorrect actions of other road users.\u201d",

      "Once known for its rice fields and folk songs, Bac Ninh has become one of Vietnam\u2019s busiest factory zones",
      "BAC NINH, Vietnam -- The transformation of Vietnam's Bac Ninh is evident in the signs above its shops and the spicy Chinese and Korean dishes on its tables.",
      "Once known for its rice fields and the love duets of its centuries-old Quan Ho folk songs, the city just north of Hanoi has become one of Vietnam's busiest factory zones, reflecting a surge of investment, hastened by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes, that are reshaping the region.",
      "The economy has profited from friction between Washington and Beijing as factories shifted out of China, joining earlier waves of foreign investment by the Japanese and South Koreans that have made Vietnam a global manufacturing hub. But rising labor costs, worker shortages and inadequate infrastructure are exposing the limits to its rapid rise.",
      "With rivals like Indonesia and the Philippines competing hard for new projects, Vietnam is trying to climb into higher-value manufacturing and expand export markets to maintain that momentum. That effort is evident in Bac Ninh.",
      "Traditionally a center for artisans, Bac Ninh\u2019s first boom began around 2008 when Samsung built its first phone factory there, turning Vietnam into its largest offshore manufacturing base.",
      "Now, Chinese companies are pouring in as they diversify their factory locations to skirt U.S. tariffs and other trade restrictions. After Hanoi and Beijing normalized ties in the 1990s, inflows of Chinese investment began to pick up as Chinese firms in places like Bac Ninh tapped Vietnam\u2019s electronics supply chain, labor force and supportive local governments, often aided by Chinese-speaking intermediaries who smooth paperwork and logistics.",
      "But Vietnam is too small to replace China, whose economy is 40 times larger, as the world's factory floor. To try to keep up, its leaders are building new infrastructure, including a highway to the Chinese border that has cut travel time by more than an hour. A railway will connect Hanoi to Haiphong \u2014 Vietnam\u2019s largest seaport \u2014 and then the border town of Lao Cai.",
      "On Dec. 19, Bac Ninh broke ground on the expansion of an industrial zone for high-tech manufacturing, including electronics, pharmaceuticals and clean energy. It's part of a synchronized nationwide push in which Vietnam launched 234 major projects worth more than $129 billion just weeks before a pivotal National Party Congress in January, when leaders will decide the country\u2019s political leadership and economic direction.",
      "In Bac Ninh's downtown, a convenience store bears the name Tmall, after Alibaba\u2019s flagship online marketplace. Signs in Chinese advertise services for investors. Chinese\u2013Vietnamese language schools have opened to help locals and Chinese to learn each others' languages.",
      "But as Chinese companies compete for the best labor and other resources, costs are rising for the \u201cChina plus one\u201d strategy of moving factories out of China to other locations, for example, Apple's shift into India.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming difficult to recruit workers,\u201d said Peng, who works at a telecoms equipment company that moved from China\u2019s southern technology hub of Shenzhen. He gave only one name because he was not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Labor costs have jumped 10%\u201315% since 2024, he said, \"And we expect them to keep rising.\u201d",
      "Vietnam still need technology, equipment and expertise from China, which had created \"the best manufacturing ecosystem,\" said Jacob Rothman, co-founder and CEO of China-based Velong Enterprises, which makes grill tools and kitchen gadgets and has shifted some production to Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Supply chains and manufacturers in China have benefited from decades of government support, large-scale investment and its huge population, Rothman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t recreate that overnight.\u201d",
      "Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer at U.S.-based SEKO Logistics, said while factories making footwear, furniture and technology are still relocating to Vietnam, it lags China in infrastructure and logistics capabilities.",
      "Some of those limits are surfacing in boomtowns like Bac Ninh, where firms are trying to lure workers with higher wages and bonuses, a box of instant noodles on their first day and bus fares if they commute from another city, according to state media.",

      "Few countries have benefitted more from Trump's trade war than Vietnam, whose biggest export market is still the U.S. In 2024, Vietnam ran a $123.5 billion surplus with the U.S., the third largest behind China and Mexico. That irked Trump, who threatened a 46% import tax on Vietnamese goods before settling on 20%.",
      "The two countries are still working toward a deal to keep most tariffs at 20%. Vietnam has offered broad preferential access for U.S. products, the White House said in October. So far, it has largely absorbed the tariffs, running a trade surplus of $121.6 billion in January-November 2025.",
      "The agreement in October by Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to a year-long trade truce and lower average tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. to about 47% helped ease some concerns. But persisting uncertainty over tariffs and other trade restrictions means companies aren\u2019t just trying to shift factories out of China but to spread them across several countries, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC.",
      "Even with lower U.S. tariffs on China, the calculus still favors moving to Southeast Asia where manufacturing inefficiencies add only about 10% in cost. But while large corporations can shift production easily, smaller firms may struggle to fit a new factory with expensive equipment.",
      "\u201c(The) race to move outside of China is still happening, and it's accelerating,\u201d Rothman said.",
      "Vietnam is still attracting ample foreign investment. Cumulative foreign investment topped $28.5 billion as of September, up 15% from last year. But scrutiny of Vietnam's role as a hub for tariff-dodging transshipments has some manufacturers hedging their bets.",
      "One of SEKO Logistics' customers has shifted some of its furniture making to India, not wanting to \u201cput all their eggs in Vietnam,\u201d Bourke said.",
      "Countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, which missed the early gains Vietnam captured, are promoting themselves as alternative manufacturing bases. In the Philippines, a new law allows foreign investors to lease private land for up to 99 years to attract long-term commercial and industrial investment.",
      "Vietnam has a goal of becoming rich by 2045. It aims to become Asia's next \u201ctiger economy,\u201d following export powerhouses like South Korea and Taiwan by shifting from low-cost assembly work to manufacture higher-value products like electronics and clean energy equipment.",
      "It's offering incentives like tax breaks on imported machinery and discounted rents to help factory suppliers upgrade and modernize. About a third still use non-automated equipment and only about 10% use robots on their production lines.",
      "The country also is trying to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market by expanding exports to the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and India. Overseas trade offices have been asked to share market intelligence and promote products made in Vietnam.",
      "Vietnam knows that rising costs and tougher competition will test how far it \u2014 and places like Bac Ninh \u2014 can climb. Announcing hundreds of projects in December, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh framed the stakes: Vietnam must \u201creach far into the ocean, delve deep underground and soar high into space.\u201d",

      "Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a key driver of the 2021 OECD global tax deal and made the corporate minimum tax one of her top priorities. The plan was widely panned by congressional Republicans who said it would make the U.S. less competitive in a global economy.",
      "The Trump administration in June re-negotiated the deal when congressional Republicans rolled back a so-called revenge tax provision from Trump\u2019s big tax and spending bill that would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as on investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",

      "News organizations got a rare \u201cthank you\u201d from the Trump administration for not putting its military action in Venezuela in jeopardy by reporting on it before it happened",
      "In the wake of last weekend's U.S. military action in Venezuela, the news media got something it has seldom heard from the Trump administration: a \u201cthank you.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited news organizations that had learned in advance about Saturday's strike that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro with not putting the mission in jeopardy by publicly reporting on it before it happened.",
      "Rubio's acknowledgment was particularly noteworthy because Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has cited a mistrust of journalists' ability to responsibly handle sensitive information as one of the chief reasons for imposing restrictive new press rules on Pentagon reporters. Most mainstream news organizations have left posts in the Pentagon rather than agree to Hegseth's policy.",
      "Speaking on ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, Rubio said the Republican administration withheld information about the mission from Congress ahead of time because \u201cit will leak. It's as simple as that.\u201d But the primary reason was operational security, he said.",
      "\u201cFrankly, a number of media outlets had gotten leaks that this was coming and held it for that very reason,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd we thank them for doing that or lives could have been lost. American lives.\u201d",
      "Semafor, citing \u201cpeople familiar with communications between the administration and news organizations,\u201d reported that The New York Times and The Washington Post had both learned of the raid in advance but held off reporting on it to avoid endangering U.S. military personnel. Representatives for both outlets declined to comment to The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "Withholding information on a planned mission for that reason is routine for news organizations, said Dana Priest, a longtime national security reporter at the Post who now teaches at the University of Maryland. Even after the fact, the Post has asked government authorities about whether revealing certain details could endanger people, she said.",
      "When The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently included in a text chain last spring where Hegseth revealed information about a military attack in Yemen, the journalist did not report on the events until well after U.S. personnel was out of danger and the information had been thoroughly checked out.",
      "Most Americans learned of the Venezuela attack in the predawn hours of Saturday when President Donald Trump announced it on his Truth Social platform upon completion.",
      "While The Associated Press did not have advance word that the operation would happen, its journalists in Venezuela heard and observed explosions taking place there, and that was reported on the news wire more than two hours before Trump's announcement. The U.S. involvement was not made clear until Trump's post, however.",
      "Hegseth, in defending rules that restrict reporters' movements and reporting in the Pentagon, told Fox News last year that \u201cwe have expectations that you're not soliciting classified or sensitive information.\u201d The Times last month filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the rules.",

But Priest stressed that in a country with freedom of the press, the ultimate decision on whether to report the information lies with the news organization.",
      "Generations ago, President John F. Kennedy persuaded editors at the Times not to report when it learned in advance of a U.S.-backed attack by Cuban exiles on Fidel Castro\u2019s forces at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. The mission proved a monumental failure, and a Times editor, Bill Keller, later said that Kennedy expressed regret that the newspaper had not reported on what it had known because it could have prevented a fiasco.",
      "Many mainstream journalists covering the military and national security have extensive experience dealing with sensitive issues, Priest said. But there's a difference, she said, between reporting information that could put someone in danger and that which could prove embarrassing to an administration.",
      "\u201cThe reporters are not going to be deterred by a ridiculously broad censorship edict by the Trump administration,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey're going to dig in and work even harder. Their mission is not to curry favor with the Trump administration. It's to report information to the public.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood kicked off 2026 with \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d atop the box office for the third straight week and with hopes for a blockbuster-filled year after a disappointing 2025.",
      "In three weeks of release, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has cleared $1 billion worldwide. The third chapter in James Cameron\u2019s Pandora epic collected $40 million over its third weekend in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d is doing its biggest business overseas; it\u2019s grossed $777.1 million internationally thus far. The Walt Disney Co. on Sunday trumped the $1 billion milestone as \u201ccementing another monumental achievement for James Cameron\u2019s groundbreaking franchise.\u201d",
      "But over the holidays, it wasn\u2019t just about the weekend ticket sales. The whole week was a lucrative one for Hollywood, with most schools still out. What drove ticket sales, beyond \u201cAvatar\u201d? Sydney Sweeney, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and \u201cZootopia 2.\u201d",
      "The most sustained success over the holiday collider in theaters belonged to a movie that opened all the way back in November. Yet Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia 2\u201d has had remarkable staying power. It landed in second place with $19 million, dipping a mere 4% from the previous weekend.",
      "The animated sequel has amassed $1.59 billion in six weeks. That makes \u201cZootopia 2\u201d Disney\u2019s second highest grossing animated movie ever, trailing only 2019\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d ($1.66 billion).",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d the twisty thriller starring Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, also emerged as a holiday-season hit for Lionsgate. It collected $14.9 million over the weekend, giving it $75.7 million domestically over three weeks. It dipped only 3% from last weekend. Internationally, \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d which cost a modest $35 million to make, has added $57.3 million.",
      "Just as Sweeney\u2019s star power is propelling \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d so is Chalamet\u2019s with \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d The A24 release also held well in its third weekend, grossing an estimated $12.6 million. After two weeks of wide release, Josh Safdie\u2019s frenetic table tennis tale has grossed $56 million in North America, passing the director\u2019s previous film, \u201cUncut Gems\u201d ($50 million worldwide).",
      "Just about everything playing in theaters saw small drops from the previous weekend. Sony\u2019s action comedy \u201cAnaconda,\u201d starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, dipped 31% to collect $10 million in second weekend. Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue\u201d dropped only 17% in its second weekend with $5.9 million. The Hugh Jackman-Kate Hudson Neil Diamond cover band movie has earned $25 million domestically.",
      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a wide variety of smaller hits, Hollywood started 2026 strongly. Overall sales were up 26.5% from the same weekend in 2025, according to data firm Comscore.",
      "The movie industry is coming off a poor 2025, where domestic moviegoing continued to slide. U.S. and Canada ticket sales in 2025 amounted to $8.9 billion, a 2% increase from the year earlier, according to Comscore, but about 20% below pre-pandemic levels. That slight improvement was notably less than anticipated and was also boosted by higher ticket prices. Actual tickets sold declined from more than 800 million in 2024 to around 780 million in 2025.",
      "The industry is now awaiting a potentially seismic shift with Warner Bros., one of the most theatrical-friendly studios, agreeing to sell to Netflix. That $83 billion deal awaits regulatory approval.",
      "Yet studios are cautiously optimistic 2026 could be the best box-office year of the decade. A release slate filled with marquee franchises, including new \u201cToy Story,\u201d \u201cAvengers,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d \u201cSuper Mario Bros\u201d and \u201cDune\u201d movies, has raised hopes of a turnaround.",

      "SOFIA, Bulgaria -- On New Year\u2019s Day, Bulgaria becomes the 21st country to join the euro currency union, furthering its integration into the European Union. But the historic milestone arrives amid political instability and skepticism among ordinary people fueled by fears of price rises.",
      "Supporters of switching to the euro from the old currency, the lev, are praising the move as one of the greatest achievements since the 1989 transition from a Soviet-style economy to democracy and free markets. They hope it will make the country more attractive for investors and strengthen its orientation toward wealthier Western Europe.",
      "But many people are uneasy, in a country where corruption is rife and trust in the authorities is low. One fear is that merchants will round prices up or otherwise use the changeover to worsen inflation, at a time when inflation has rebounded to 3.7%.",
      "An EU Eurobarometer poll from March showed that 53% of 1,017 people surveyed opposed joining the eurozone, while 45% were in favor. A separate Eurobarometer poll, taken between Oct. 9 and Nov. 3 on a similar sample, showed that about half of Bulgarians opposed the single currency while 42% were in favor. The margin of error was about plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for the March poll.",
      "The government successfully completed the euro adoption process by beating inflation down to 2.7% earlier this year to comply with EU rules and win approval from EU leaders. But clearing that hurdle was followed by a new chapter of political chaos. The government resigned after less than a year in office amid nationwide anti-corruption protests. This left the country without a regular budget for next year and is hampering plans for long-overdue structural reforms and decisions on use of EU support funds. A new election \u2014 the eighth in five years \u2014 is expected to be held next spring.",
      "Nevelin Petrov, 64, said he welcomed the euro. \u201cBulgaria is a full member of the European Union, and its rightful place is alongside the other developed and democratic European nations,\u201d he said. \u201cI am convinced that the adoption of the euro will contribute to the long-term prosperity of our country,\u201d he said.",

      "Bulgaria, with its 6.4 million people, is one of the poorest members of the 27-country European union. The average monthly wage is 1,300 euros ($1,530).",
      "Countries that join the EU commit to the euro, but actually joining can take years and some members are in no hurry. Poland in particular has seen strong economic growth since joining the EU in 2004 without adopting the euro.",
      "Opponents of joining have fed fears that the changes will allegedly lead to more poverty and loss of national identity. Social media has spread disinformation such as false claims that the euro could lead to confiscation of bank accounts. Nationalist and pro-Russian groups exploit these fears.",
      "European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has said that countries have experienced a slight, transient rise in prices of 0.2%-0.4% right after joining. Price rises can be more apparent than real, as cafe and hairdressers may put off printing new menus and price lists ahead of the change, so that increases are only delayed, not caused by the euro.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Donald Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one\u2019s efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don\u2019t get their health insurance from an employer and don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters\u2019 concerns.",
      "\u201cIt really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\u201d said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly disappointed that there hasn\u2019t been more action.\u201d",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It\u2019s a strain for the 49-year-old but one he\u2019s willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker\u2019s monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",

      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she\u2019ll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her four-year-old daughter. She can\u2019t afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it\u2019s unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",

      "The NASCAR community is reeling after a series of tragic events",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The new year began with a celebration of life for Emma Biffle, the 14-year-old daughter of one of NASCAR\u2019s 75 greatest drivers who was among seven people killed when Greg Biffle\u2019s plane crashed just a week before Christmas.",
      "The service Sunday was standing room only as the performing arts center in suburban Cornelius wasn't large enough to accommodate the turnout from the racing community and Davidson Day, the private school where many sent their children alongside Emma.",
      "The heartbreaking memorial to a teenager lost in a tragic accident capped a month of sorrow for NASCAR with a new season just weeks away. The grieving isn't over, either, far from it.",
      "It's not like the 2025 season ended on the highest note: Denny Hamlin was again denied his first Cup Series championship on a late sequence of events in the season finale that gave the title to Kyle Larson. When Larson was done with his post-race news conference, there was a toast in honor of Jon Edwards, a Hendrick Motorsports communications executive and mentor to many who died unexpectedly in April, a loss felt all season.",
      "Then came December, usually the start of a quiet offseason in which teams and drivers and every member of the 38-week traveling circus unwinds. Instead, it opened with a bruising federal trial in which two race teams accused NASCAR of being a monopolistic bully; the Michael Jordan-led lawsuit included eight days of testimony that embarrassed NASCAR until the France family settled a day before Hall of Fame owners Rick Hendrick and Roger Penske were due to testify. The landmark agreement will change the current revenue sharing model.",
      "The relief was far too brief. Biffle's plane crashed Dec. 18 shortly after encountering an issue after takeoff from the nearby Statesville airport as the group tried to return for an emergency landing. Biffle was among those killed along with his wife, Cristina, five-year-old son, Ryder, and Emma, the only child from his first marriage.",
      "In a letter written by Nicole Biffle that she was too grief-stricken to read herself at her daughter's service, she agonized over her decision to allow Emma to fly that day knowing Emma wasn't feeling well. She had purchased tickets to Italy as a Christmas present for her daughter the night before the crash.",
      "Ten days after that tragedy, on the 52nd wedding anniversary of Denny Hamlin's parents, the house he built to repay them for their years of sacrifice to get the future Hall of Famer to NASCAR's top level, burned down. His father, Dennis, was killed. Mary Lou Hamlin was rushed to a hospital burn unit. Hamlin's childhood racing memorabilia was lost along with his father.",
      "If there was any animosity from NASCAR toward Hamlin, a co-owner of the race team with Jordan that sued the series, it dissipated in a heartfelt statement from the sanctioning body.",
      "\u201cDennis Hamlin instilled a love of racing in his son, and sacrificed greatly to develop Denny into a world-class talent in the sport,\u201d NASCAR said. \"We also continue to offer our thoughts and prayers to Denny\u2019s mother, Mary Lou, and hope for her full recovery.\u201d",
      "The racing community is a quirky one, with hundreds of people living not just in and around Charlotte but feet away from one another in motorhome parking lots in infields around the country for three-fourths of the year. Relationships can sometimes be contentious and grudges held for years, even decades.",

      "Myles Sansted kicked the extra point in overtime as Montana State won its first national championship since 1984, beating Illinois State 35-34 Monday night in the Football Championship Subdivision title game",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Montana State finally found a way to answer when it mattered most for the program\u2019s first national championship since 1984.",
      "A year ago, Montana State missed winning its first title in 40 years when a slow start doomed it in a shootout loss to North Dakota State. Two years ago, the Bobcats\u2019 season ended in Bozeman in the quarterfinals on a blocked extra point in overtime against the Bison.",
      "They started this season losing the first two \u2014 at Oregon and a double- overtime loss at home to South Dakota State.",
      "So when Myles Sansted\u2019s extra point went through the uprights in overtime for a 35-34 victory over Illinois State on Monday night in the Football Championship Subdivision title game, the Bobcats chucked helmets in the air while sprinting around with a heavy contingent of Montana State fans celebrating with them.",
      "\u201cTo be able to clear that hurdle and know that yes this \u201925 group accomplished what hadn\u2019t been done in a long time ...,\u201d said coach Brent Vigen, who\u2019s already thinking ahead with a young, Montana-laden team featuring only nine seniors. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re building for more.\u201d",
      "The Bobcats (14-2) capped a season that featured not one, but two wins over in-state rival Montana over a four-week span. Beating Montana in the semifinals put Montana State back into the title game for the second straight season, third in five years under Vigen and the fourth berth overall.",
      "Montana State topped that accomplishment with its 14th straight win in a thrilling finish in the first overtime in the 48 years of this title game. The Bobcats led 21-7 at halftime and 28-14 in the third. They needed Jhase McMillan\u2019s block of Michael Cosentino\u2019s 38-yard field goal attempt with 57 seconds left in regulation to keep it tied at 28.",
      "In overtime, Justin Lamson tied it with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Taco Dowler on fourth-and-10. Hunter Parsons blocked the extra point attempt after Tommy Rittenhouse threw a 10-yard TD pass to Dylan Lord to give Illinois State its only lead at 34-28 to open overtime.",
      "Stansted\u2019s kick started the celebration of the end of a long title drought. Along with the 1984 I-AA championship, Montana State also won the 1976 NCAA Division II title and 1956 NAIA championship.",
      "\u201cWhat a hard fought game, and these things aren\u2019t supposed to come easily I guess,\u201d Vigen said.",
      "Lamson, who didn\u2019t join the Bobcats until June, said the OT touchdown was a great play call.",
      "\u201cTaco was wide open,\u201d Lamson said. \u201cI got hit so I was just trying to give him a chance and the rest is history, and Myles did his thing and that was the game.\u201d",
      "Illinois State (12-5) already made history as the first FCS team to win four straight road games to advance through the playoffs to this championship game. That included a win over this postseason\u2019s No. 1 seed and North Dakota State \u2014 winners of 10 of the last 14 FCS championships including last year.",

      "Spack said he thought ball-handling issues might be why both the field goal and extra point attempts were blocked. Cosentino has the ability to get the ball up in the air, which is why Spack decided to go for the lead with the field goal attempt.",

      "Tuesday's match was Williams' 1,101st in singles on the WTA Tour. But the competitiveness she showed against a player 12 years her junior will give her confidence as she heads to Australia for the Hobart International and the Australian Open.",
      "The seven-time major champion received wild-card entries into the Auckland tournament and also in Hobart from Jan. 12 and at the first Grand Slam tournament of the year at Melbourne Park.",
      "The Auckland match was Williams' first since she lost 6-3, 2-6, 5-1 to Karolina Muchova in the first round of the U.S. Open last August. She played only three tournaments in 2025, beating Peyton Stearns in July to become the second-oldest woman \u2014 behind Martina Navratilova \u2014 to win a match on the WTA Tour.",

      "\"It was really impressive and I really had to stay calm. She pushes you to a spot you don't want to be and that's where I was for a while, so I'm really glad I was able to refresh and come back with a little bit better game.\u201d",
      "Williams, ranked No. 582 this week, has been a regular visitor to Auckland in the latter part of her career. She beat Caroline Wozniacki in the 2015 final for the 41st of her 46 WTA Tour titles. This year, she told reporters, she felt under no pressure.",
      "\u201cThe biggest pressure is the one we put on ourselves, right?\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd then when you look back and you\u2019re like, \u2018it wasn\u2019t such a big deal.\u2019",
      "\u201cSo hopefully I can look back with the 20/20 vision while I\u2019m in the present, like just let it go, let it flow, enjoy it and be in the moment. That\u2019s not easy to do and that\u2019s why people love sports, right?\u201d",

AI industry heavyweight Jensen Huang will be taking the stage to showcase Nvidia's latest productivity solutions, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will keynote to \u201cshare her vision for delivering future AI solutions.\u201d Expect AI to come up in other keynotes, like from Lenovo's CEO, Yuanqing Yang.",

      "What's more, Trump Mobile initially hailed T1 as a device that would be \u201cproudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best.\"",
      "But both the T1's shipping date and U.S. manufacturing ambitions gradually began to shift, even as Trump Mobile continues to accept $100 deposits for the device.",
      "Not long after announcing the device, Trump Mobile pivoted from describing it as phone that would be made in the U.S. to framing it as a device that would be \u201cproudly American.\u201d Trump Mobile's website now touts the T1 as having an \u201cAmerican-proud\u201d design, with no further explanation.",
      "Analysts believed that the shift stemmed from a recognition that the U.S. lacked the supply chain and other logistics required to make a smartphone for less than $1,000 \u2014 the same hurdles that made it implausible for Apple to acquiesce to President Trump's demands that the company move its iPhone manufacturing from China and India.",
      "Later in the summer, Trump Mobile also became more vague about when the T1 would become available, but still indicated it would be delivered to customers who paid the $100 deposit by the end of 2025. Trump Mobile's website continues to list the T1's targeted release date as \u201clater this year.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have always been quite skeptical about this phone,\u201d Jeronimo said. \u201cThey are probably finding that it is harder to build a phone than they thought it would be. Let's see if this thing comes to life or not.\u201d",
      "While the T1 has remained in a holding pattern, Trump Mobile has been selling its wireless service for $47.45 per month \u2014 a price tied to Donald Trump's titles as the 47th and 45th President. For customers looking for a smartphone that they can use sooner rather than later, Trump Mobile is also selling refurbished versions of older iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy models at prices ranging from $370 to $630.",
      "\u201cMaybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,\u201d Jeronimo said.",

      "Communities across the United States are reading about \u2014 and learning from \u2014 each other's battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a huge problem,\u201d Cvengros said.",
      "Data Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development.",

      "LaMalfa's chief of staff, Mark Spannagel, released a statement on behalf of the congressman\u2019s office confirming his death early Tuesday morning.",
      "\"Early this morning Congressman Doug LaMalfa returned home to the Lord. He leaves a lasting legacy of servant leadership [and] kindness to the North State,\" the statement noted. \"His humor and work effort are legendary - with one reporter once saying he\u2019d look in the back yard of every BBQ just to see if Doug was there visiting.\"",
      "\"Congressman LaMalfa cared deeply for the people he served and worked tirelessly to hold the government to its word to fix our failing forests, build water storage, and leave people to be free to choose what is best for themselves,\" the statement continued. \"His tragic and unexpected passing leaves a deep impact on many.

      "In the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.",

The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven\u2019t seen in a very long time.\u201d said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.",
      "In the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland \u2014 where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons \u2014 and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to \u201cget their act together\u201d fighting drug cartels.",
      "Trump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is \u201cgoing down\u201d now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia \u2014 the epicenter of global cocaine production \u2014 \"sounds good to me.\"",
      "The Republican president has also said his administration will \u201crun\u201d Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not \u201cdo what\u2019s right.\u201d He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.",

      "The Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump\u2011aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non\u2011aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. \u201cabsolutely\u201d needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.",
      "\u201cIf the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\u201d Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.",

      "Just weeks before the ouster of Maduro, Trump rolled out a long-awaited National Security Strategy that had some disparate elements that seemed to be at odds with each other.",
      "On one hand, Trump, who has long eschewed America's role in foreign wars, asserted that the administration would have a \u201cpredisposition to non-interventionism.\u201d But the strategy document also made clear that the administration would push \u201cto restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d",
      "With the ouster of Maduro, the administration has clearly doubled down on the latter.",
      "\u201cThis is the Western Hemisphere,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an appearance on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \"This is where we live \u2014 and we\u2019re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.\u201d",

      "A Texas judge has seated a jury in the trial of a former school police officer who was part of the hesitant law enforcement response to the Uvalde school shooting in 2022",
      "CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas -- A Texas judge seated a jury Monday in the trial of a former school police officer in Uvalde who was part of the hesitant law enforcement response to one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history and has been charged with failing to protect children from the gunman.",
      "Adrian Gonzales, one of the first officers to respond to the 2022 attack, is charged with 29 counts of child abandonment or endangerment in a rare prosecution of an officer accused of not doing more to save lives. Authorities waited more than an hour to confront the teenage shooter who killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary.",
      "Gonzales has pleaded not guilty, and his attorney has said the officer tried to save children that day.",
      "The panel of 12 jurors and four alternates were seated Monday evening by Judge Sid Harle, after hundreds of prospective jurors were asked what they knew about the response and their impressions of what happened. The judge had said the court was not looking for jurors who knew nothing about the shooting but wanted those who could be impartial.",
      "About 100 people were dismissed after saying they already formed opinions. One man said more officers should be on trial, while a teacher said she would throw herself in front of her students to protect them.",
      "Bill Turner, a special prosecutor, told potential jurors they would would need to consider whether the inaction of the officer proved harmful.",
      "\u201cIf there is a duty to act and you fail to act, that\u2019s child endangerment,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge said the trial was expected to last about two weeks.",
      "Among the potential witnesses are FBI agents, rangers with the Texas Department of Public Safety, school employees and family members of the victims.",
      "Nearly 400 officers from state, local and federal law enforcement agencies responded to the school, but 77 minutes passed from the time authorities arrived until a tactical team breached the classroom and killed the shooter, Salvador Ramos. An investigation later showed that Ramos was obsessed with violence and notoriety in the months leading up to the attack.",
      "Gonzales and former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo were among the first on the scene, and they are the only two officers to face criminal charges over the response. Arredondo's trial has not been scheduled.",
      "The charges against Gonzales carry up to two years in prison if he is convicted.",
      "Police and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott initially said swift law enforcement action killed Ramos and saved lives. But that version quickly unraveled as families described begging police to go into the building and 911 calls emerged from students pleading for help.",
      "The indictment alleges Gonzales placed children in \u201cimminent danger\u201d of injury or death by failing to engage, distract or delay the shooter and by not following his active shooter training. The allegations also say he did not advance toward the gunfire despite hearing shots and being told where the shooter was.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 08:41:44 -0500",
    "summary": "For retirement savers and retirees, the new year brings more than the usual inflation adjustments to retirement contributions",
    "story": [
      "For retirement savers and retirees, the new year brings more than the usual inflation adjustments to retirement contributions",
      "For retirement savers and retirees, the new year brings more than the usual inflation adjustments to retirement contributions. The retirement legislation known as Secure 2.0 will also continue to phase in, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will have impacts too.",
      "Here\u2019s a roundup of three key changes and some moves to consider.",
      "Thanks to a provision in the Secure 2.0 retirement legislation, high-income earners (with $150,000 or more in FICA income in the prior year) who are over 50 and investing in 401(k) or other company retirement plans must make catch-up contributions to their plans\u2019 Roth option, rather than traditional tax-deferred contributions, starting this year.",
      "For 2026, 401(k) investors under 50 can contribute $24,500 to their company plans, plus $8,000 in catch-up contributions if they\u2019re over 50, for a total of $32,500. In addition, people age 60 to 63 can make \u201csuper-catch-up\u201d contributions: $11,250 on top of $24,500.",
      "Potential Action Items:Some 401(k) plans may not have a Roth option, so those participants should instead consider making a full IRA contribution in addition to their baseline 401(k) contributions ($24,500).This year, the IRA contribution limit is $8,600 for people over 50and $7,500 for those under 50. If you can invest even more than that, steer the overage to a taxable brokerage account.",
      "A separate issue is how 401(k) investors should proceed if their goal is to make traditional tax-deferred contributions rather than Roth. Secure 2.0 forces higher-income older workers into Roth, at least with the catch-up portion of their contributions. In that case, workers can contribute the base 401(k) limit ($24,500) to the traditional tax-deferred option, with catch-up contributions directed to the Roth option.",
      "Thanks to OBBBA, taxpayers can now deduct a higher amount of state and local taxes. The SALT deduction cap was increased from $10,000 to $40,000 starting in 2025. It will revert to $10,000 in 2030.",
      "Potential Action Items:How is this related to retirement? The amount of SALT that\u2019s deductible phases out for higher-income taxpayers\u2014those with modified adjusted gross incomes over $500,000. High-income earners should consider ways to come in under $500,000 if they\u2019re close. They might favor contributions to traditional tax-deferred retirement plans rather than Roth or max out their health savings accounts. Qualifying for the higher SALT tax deduction might also argue against strategies that increase income, such as converting traditional IRAs to Roth.",
      "Of course, don\u2019tmiss the forest for the trees. Strategies like making Roth contributions or converting IRAs might make sense long-term, even if they curtail the deductibility of SALT.",
      "Through 2028, people 65and up can take advantage of a new $6,000 deduction. It\u2019savailable whether you itemize or not and doubles to $12,000 for married couples filing jointly, assuming both are 65. For non-itemizers, the new deduction would stack on top of standard deductions.",
      "Here\u2019s how the deductions look this year:",
      "1. Single filers (standard deduction): $16,1002. Single filers over 65: $16,100+ $2,050 + $6,000 = $24,1503. Married couples filing jointly (standard deduction): $32,2004. Married couples over 65 filing jointly: $32,200 + $1,650x2 + $6,000x2 = $47,500",
      "1. Single filers (standard deduction): $16,100",
      "2. Single filers over 65: $16,100+ $2,050 + $6,000 = $24,150",
      "3. Married couples filing jointly (standard deduction): $32,200",
      "4. Married couples over 65 filing jointly: $32,200 + $1,650x2 + $6,000x2 = $47,500",
      "Higher-income seniors, take note: Income limits apply. The deduction is reduced for single filers with modified adjusted gross incomes over $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with MAGI over $150,000.It goes away entirely for singles with MAGI over $175,000 and married couples filing jointly with MAGI of $250,000 or more.",

      "The whales have fared better than last winter, when they gave birth to only 11 calves, according to NOAA data. The whales have reached 20 calves only twice since 2010, and they gave birth to no calves in a disastrous 2018 season. The whales are less likely to reproduce when they have suffered injuries or are underfed, scientists have said.",
      "The whales were hunted to the brink of extinction during the era of commercial whaling and have been federally protected for decades. They remain in a crisis at the moment because there have been more deaths than births in the population in the past decade, NOAA said in its statement.",

      "\u201cThe market\u2019s broad, confident and consistent march upward, and the absence of emotion-based selling, tells you we\u2019re starting the year on pretty solid footing,\u201d Hackett wrote, in a note to investors.",
      "Gold gained 2.8% and the price of silver soared 7.9%. Such assets are often considered safe havens in times of geopolitical turmoil. The metals have notched record prices over the last year amid lingering economic concerns brought on by conflicts and trade wars.",
      "Bitcoin rose to its highest level since mid-November, hitting $94,700. Coinbase jumped 7.8% and Robinhood Markets jumped 7% for two of the markets biggest gains.",
      "Treasury yields fell in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.15% from 4.19% late Friday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves more closely with expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do, fell to 3.45% from 3.48% late Friday.",
      "Wall Street will get several economic updates this week that will also be watched by the Fed as it determines interest rate policy.",
      "On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management released its manufacturing index for December showing the sector continued shrinking. More importantly, the business group will release its December report on the services sector on Wednesday. The services sector makes up the bulk of the U.S. economy and it grew, even if only slightly, throughout most of 2025.",
      "Reports on the job market later this week, which include updates for job openings and overall employment, will be a bigger focus for the Fed. The central bank has been weighing a slowing job market against risks for rising inflation as it decides whether to cut interest rates. It cut its benchmark rate three times late in 2025, but inflation has remained above its 2% target and that has made the Fed more cautious.",
      "Wall Street still expects the Fed to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting later in January.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Approaching the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the official plaque honoring the police who defended democracy that day is nowhere to be found.",
      "It\u2019s not on display at the Capitol, as is required by law. Its whereabouts aren't publicly known, though it\u2019s believed to be in storage.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has yet to formally unveil the plaque. And the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Justice is seeking to dismiss a police officers' lawsuit asking that it be displayed as intended. The Architect of the Capitol, which was responsible for obtaining and displaying the plaque, said in light of the federal litigation, it cannot comment.",
      "Determined to preserve the nation's history, some 100 members of Congress, mostly Democrats, have taken it upon themselves to memorialize the moment. For months, they've mounted poster board-style replicas of the Jan. 6 plaque outside their office doors, resulting in a Capitol complex awash with makeshift remembrances.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of a grateful Congress, this plaque honors the extraordinary individuals who bravely protected and defended this symbol of democracy on Jan. 6, 2021,\u201d reads the faux bronze stand-in for the real thing. \u201cTheir heroism will never be forgotten.\u201d",
      "In Washington, a capital city lined with monuments to the nation\u2019s history, the plaque was intended to become a simple but permanent marker, situated near the Capitol\u2019s west front, where some of the most violent fighting took place as rioters breached the building.",
      "But in its absence, the missing plaque makes way for something else entirely \u2014 a culture of forgetting.",
      "Visitors can pass through the Capitol without any formal reminder of what happened that day, when a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building trying to overturn the Republican's 2020 reelection defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. With memory left unchecked, it allows new narratives to swirl and revised histories to take hold.",
      "Five years ago, the jarring scene watched the world over was declared an \u201cinsurrection\u201d by the then-GOP leader of the Senate, while the House GOP leader at the time called it his \u201csaddest day\u201d in Congress. But those condemnations have faded.",
      "Trump calls it a \u201cday of love.\u201d And Johnson, who was among those lawmakers challenging the 2020 election results, is now the House speaker.",
      "\u201cThe question of January 6 remains \u2013 democracy was on the guillotine \u2014 how important is that event in the overall sweep of 21st century U.S. history,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University and noted scholar.",
      "\u201cWill January 6 be seen as the seminal moment when democracy was in peril?\u201d he asked. Or will it be remembered as \u201ckind of a weird one-off?\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not as much consensus on that as one would have thought on the fifth anniversary,\u201d he said.",
      "At least five people died in the riot and its aftermath, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by police while trying to climb through a window toward the House chamber. More than 140 law enforcement officers were wounded, some gravely, and several died later, some by suicide.",
      "All told, some 1,500 people were charged in the Capitol attack, among the largest federal prosecutions in the nation\u2019s history. When Trump returned to power in January 2025, he pardoned all of them within hours of taking office.",
      "Unlike the twin light beams that commemorated the Sept. 11, 2001, attack or the stand-alone chairs at the Oklahoma City bombing site memorial, the failure to recognize Jan. 6 has left a gap not only in memory but in helping to stitch the country back together.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why you put up a plaque,\u201d said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa. \u201cYou respect the memory and the service of the people involved.\u201d",

      "Lawmakers approved the plaque in March 2022 as part of a broader government funding package. The resolution said the U.S. \"owes its deepest gratitude to those officers,\u201d and it set out instructions for an honorific plaque listing the names of officers \u201cwho responded to the violence that occurred.\u201d It gave a one-year deadline for installation at the Capitol.",

      "She added picking the perfect jokes for the show is \"one of \u2026 the most difficult jobs I've ever done.\"",

      "\"It is easy for me to take down like, you know, the newer batch of actresses and actors who are younger than me. It is like, OK I can make fun of you, I'm like a veteran. But when it's like people I grew up admiring it's \u2026 oh, my gosh, it is so much \u2026 it is a different approach this year.\"",
      "While preparing last year, Glaser reached out to some celebrities to see if a joke went too far. She said she hasn't done this yet so far and may have a different strategy.",
      "\"There are certain people that I don't know what I would say. It is almost like some of these jokes, you think about, OK, if I got their number, would I write them and ask them? Then I go, you know what? They might say no and I know the joke isn't that mean, and \u2026 I would rather ask for forgiveness later at the after-party when they're drunk,\" she said with a laugh.",

    "summary": "The HBO Max drama immerses viewers in the struggles faced by the ER staff at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. \"Sunday Morning\" visits the hyper-realistic set, and talks with star, writer, director and executive producer Noah Wyle.",
    "story": [
      "Beginning in the 1960s, medical dramas became a staple of primetime TV. You may have followed the trials and tribulations of Doctors James Kildare, Marcus Welby, Hawkeye Pierce, Mark Craig, Michaela Quinn, and then, in 1994, \"ER\"'s Dr. John Carter, played by Noah Wyle.",
      "Wyle says that, when \"ER\" ended, the odds that someday he'd do another medical show were \"zero percent.\"",
      "So, what changed? \"COVID,\" he said. \"COVID changed everything, certainly for me in thinking about there being another story to tell. I was getting a lot of mail from people on the frontlines saying,'We could sure use Dr. Carter out here.' Or, 'This is really awful.'\"",
      "For his work on \"ER,\" Wyle was nominated as best supporting actor five times \u2026 and finally took home an Emmy this past September, when he received the trophy as outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his portrayal of Dr. Michael Robinavitch \u2013 Dr. Robby \u2013 on \"The Pitt.\" The hit HBO Max medical series won five Emmys in all, including outstanding drama series.",
      "And Season 2 is about to begin.",
      "Dr. Robby watches over the controlled chaos at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. It all takes place over a single emergency room shift, and each episode covers just one hour in a very long day.",
      "A few months ago, \"Sunday Morning\" visited the set at the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California. Walk from backstage into the emergency room, and you feel you are in an actual hospital.",
      "Wyle said, \"It became really important to have the entire set feel like a totally immersive experience. You open a drawer, everything that's supposed to be in the drawer is there. Everything feels real, and is exactly where it should go.\"",
      "Wyle is in charge here in more ways than one. Not only is he a lead actor; he's an executive producer and writer. And on the days we dropped in, he also directed.",
      "Actors at \"The Pitt\" have to learn more than their lines. There's a two-week medical boot camp. Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira, herself an emergency room doctor, is one of the show's medical technical consultants: \"We try our best to educate them on CPR, how to suture, how to intubate, the natural mechanics, so that when they are on screen and the camera is quite tight and close, everything looks finessed and refined, as if someone with experience has done it.\"",
      "She helps make sure the procedures look thoroughly real, as in Episode 10, involving a patient who'd been slugged in the eye by a baseball. She helps make sure the procedures \u2013 and the prosthetics \u2013 look thoroughly real.",
      "That hyper-authenticity extends to the storylines, as when a nurse is punched by a patient. Executive producers John Wells said, \"Since COVID, there's a kind of a stress level and anger that exists in the population. And that has translated particularly to violence against nurses, but against all the healthcare providers [as well].\"",
      "Wells and fellow executive producer Scott Gemmill \u2013 both veterans of the series \"ER\" \u2013 said \"The Pitt\" also addresses the issue of loss of trust that the public has in public health. \"Disinformation, that was one of the biggest changes, I think, besides COVID,\" Gemmill said. \"I don't remember the disinformation being at a level that it is these days.\"",
      "Wells said, \"The biggest thing that we talk about regularly is Dr. Google \u2013 this notion that everybody who comes in is already on their phone figuring out what it is that supposedly is wrong with them, and half the people have assumed that they've got the worst possible thing that could happen to them. And that's part of what the erosion of trust is. You're defending yourself against artificial intelligence and what's going to happen next.\"",
      "\"The Pitt\"'s second season will continue to reflect real life and real problems. Wyle said, \"People are going to lose their health insurance. People are going to delay care. People are going to continue to come in sicker. They're going to be more volatile when they come in. That's going to put more of a burden on staff. All this stuff is sort of moving towards this perfect storm of unsustainability.\"",
      "Wyle's connection to the medical community is more than what's in a script: his mother, Marjorie Speer, was an orthopedic and operating room nurse. \"Mom's at the hospital all day, I got to walk home from school until mom gets home,\" Wyle said. \"And then 35 years later, she's watching an episode of 'The Pitt,' and comes over and says, 'That rocked me.' She just starts listing all these names of patients that she had seen die when she was practicing. I said, 'Mom, I've never heard these stories before.' And she goes, 'Oh, yeah.' We were her kids, and she didn't show us that stuff.\"",
      "But \"The Pitt\" does show us that stuff, and what happens when an empathetic doctor stops having empathy for himself.",
      "\"You know, in the old days, it was kind of 'suck it up,' and it was a little bit of like, 'I went through it, so you got to go through it,' you know? This is your training,\" Wyle said.",
      "\"We were up for four days straight!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! And it became a badge of honor to survive it.\"",
      "Gemmill said, \"We get feedback from people who, having seen the show, realize that they, too, are suffering and have buried it the same way that the Robby character did.\"",
      "Which brings us to Dr. Robinavitch's meltdown. \"Everything is going crazy. We need the hero to come in on his white horse and save the day,\" Wyle said. \"He's on the floor! \u00a0The hero's on the floor? How can that be?\"",
      "So, three decades after \"ER,\" Noah Wyle is once again playing a dedicated doctor \u2013 and as it turns out, it's a prescription he wrote for himself. \"There were two points in my career. during the pandemic and during this last work stoppage for the writers and actors' strike, those were the two moments when the flow of my career [was] interrupted, and I wasn't used to it,\" he said. \"It really rattled me in a way that \u2026 that rattled me. I remember saying to my wife, like, 'I don't think I work for money. I think I work for health, my own health. Like, I think this is where I get my orientation. And without it, I'm not sure I know what I do on this Earth.'\"",
      "And now? \u00a0\"I'm the happiest I've been in a long time,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Does that surprise you?\"",
      "\"It just confirms, you know, it confirms all my worst suspicions about myself, which is that I really need all this!\" Wyle laughed.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:16:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers in \"Sinners,\" says shooting Ryan Coogler's horror film set in the Depression Era South \u2013 a drama that melds Jim Crow racism with vampires \u2013 is also a testament to the power of family.",
    "story": [
      "It's not much of a stretch to say that Michael B. Jordan has fought his way to the top. His performances are often game-changing \u2013 as a boxing champ (in \"Creed\"), a Marvel superhero (in \"Fantastic Four\"), or a Marvel villain (in \"Black Panther\").",
      "But his latest film required a different kind of superpower: In Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners,\" Jordan plays twin brothers, Stack and Smoke, who open a backwoods honkytonk in the segregated South.",
      "When Coogler shared the idea of him playing two different characters, Jordan says his reaction was, \"'I'm a do what?' I think it was a little bit of anxiety, I think. A little bit nerves. But then, equal amount of excitement.\"",
      "And it gets really exciting when vampires show up. \"Sinners\" is a horror film, but it's also about history, and the power of family ties.",
      "To play characters from the Jim Crow South, Jordan drew a bit from his own family history. Relatives on his mother's side hail from Hope, Arkansas, but years ago moved to a segregated Black neighborhood in Los Angeles called Oakwood (a place that is now Venice Beach).",
      "We visited the First Baptist Church of Venice, which was the center of their community, and one of the only remnants still standing. Jordan, who moved to New Jersey as a toddler, never went to this place of worship, but he says he can still feel the connection to his family's past. \"I grew up in church, you know, very spiritual family,\" he said. \"Churches were, like, safe havens \u2013 places of prayer and refuge \u2026 The history, I mean, you can feel the weight when you walk into a place like this.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did shooting 'Sinners' make you think about your own family history more?\"",
      "\"Big time,\" he replied. \"It definitely connected me back to my family's history that I've always had a strong connection with, but it just kind of reframed it a bit.\"",
      "His own history is remarkable as well: Dad is a U.S. Marine veteran; mom is a former high school counselor; and Michael Bakari Jordan was a child model, then a child star. He was still in high school when he was cast in the landmark series \"The Wire,\" and a few years later in another landmark show, \"Friday Night Lights.\"",
      "He said, \"There's nobody in my family that came from this, I guess, that looked at it as a potential career, you know? I think once I didn't go to college and I decided to move to California and pursue acting full-time, there was, like, there was no turning back after that one.\"",
      "His film breakout came in 2013 in director Ryan Coogler's drama \"Fruitvale Station.\"",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Michael B. Jordan, Ryan Coogler on \"Fruitvale Station\" (YouTube Video)",
      "Jordan worked with Coogler again a few years later when he climbed into the ring for 2015's \"Creed,\" a spin-off of the \"Rocky\" franchise \u2013 and, by the way, the first Rocky film where Sylvester Stallone didn't have top billing.",
      "Jordan said, \"Doing 'Creed,' so many different levels. The first time I transform my body, you know, learned a skill that I continue to do today, you know?\"",
      "\"You still box?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it's a part of me at this point,\" he said.",
      "And this character of Erik Killmonger, the bad guy in \"Black Panther\" who tried to dethrone the hero played by the late Chadwick Boseman, stuck with him, too, but not in a good way. He says it was hard to shake Erik. \"Yes, it kind of stuck with me for a bit. And, you know, went to therapy and talked about it. Found a way to kind of just decompress, I think at that point still learning that I needed to decompress from a character.\"",
      "\"So, you literally went to therapy to help rid yourself a little bit of Erik?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. And then I think that spiraled into a bigger conversation and self-discovery of, like, 'Okay, you know, I think that's something that's necessary for people, you know?' Especially men. I think it's good for them to go and talk. That's something I'm not ashamed of at all, and very proud of. And definitely helped me trying to be a good communicator and a well-rounded person, inside and out.\"",
      "For Jordan, now 38, part of being well-rounded is a strong relationship with mom and dad. He even continued to live with his parents up until well after he could afford to move out on his own. \"This is true,\" he said.",
      "Why? \"I mean, 'cause I love my parents. You know, I love them. Made for a lotta funny moments, lotta great stories.\"",
      "Like? \u00a0\"Y'all ain't got enough time!\" he laughed. \"I'm a night owl, you know? Like, just things, you know? They go to sleep early. Insert moment here.\"",
      "We should mention Jordan bought them a house of their own in the L.A. suburbs; he just lived there for a while.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to buy your parents a house, you know, your mom a house? It's like, that's always been the childhood dream, is to retire your parents and them not having to work anymore,\" he said. \"And I can say I did that. So that's, like, yeah, that's a bucket list.\"",
      "\"Sinners\" is squarely in the Oscar conversation, both for the film and for Jordan's performance. It's a welcome distinction for someone who lived his early life under the shadow of another famous Michael.",
      "\"You grew up playing sports, right?\" I asked. \"Was the name Michael Jordan a problem?\"",
      "\"Big time!\" he said. \"I got teased so much, to the point where I almost changed my name.\"",
      "He was going to lean on his middle name: Bakari Jordan. \"It definitely made me want to be competitive and be good at \u2013 I wanted to be great at something, if not for nothing else at that time just to, like, feel like I had my own identity,\" he said.",
      "I said, \"But there could be another Michael Jordan who could make his mark.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" said Jordan. \"That was a part of the alchemy that made me who I am today.\"",
      "Put it this way: Michael Bakari Jordan could be on his way to his own brand of immortality \u2013 after all, Bakari means \"noble promise.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel like you've fulfilled that?\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm walking in that,\" Jordan replied, \"and will continue to do so, big time. We got a lot more things to do, you know? We're just getting started.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Environmental journalist Tatiana Schlossberg (May 5, 1990-Dec. 30, 2025), a grandchild of President John F. Kennedy, worked as a reporter for The New York Times' Science section, and was author of the award-winning 2019 book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have.\"",
      "In a November 2025 essay in The New Yorker, titled \"A Battle With My Blood,\" she wrote of how her life changed, shockingly, upon the birth of her second child in May 2024 at age 34. Hours after giving birth, Schlossberg's doctors noticed a spike in her white-blood-cell count. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, mostly seen in older people. \"I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,\" she wrote.",
      "The daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, she recounted in her essay going through rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants and participating in clinical trials. During the most recent trial, she wrote, her doctor told her \"he could keep me alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good,\" she wrote, \"to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\"",
      "In her essay, Schlossberg criticized her mother's cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for pushing policies (including slashing nearly $500 million for research into mRNA vaccines against certain cancers) that could impact patients like her. She also wrote movingly of her family's support, and of the valiant efforts of medical staff to help her. \"I have never encountered a group of people who are more competent, more  full of grace and empathy, more willing to serve others than nurses,\" she wrote. \"Nurses should take over.\"",
      "She feared her daughter and son wouldn't remember her, and mourned the life and work she would not experience \u2013 from watching her children grow up, to writing a book about the oceans.",
      "\"Mostly, I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go,\" she wrote. \"So many of them are from my childhood that I feel as if I'm watching myself and my kids grow up at the same time. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't. But since I don't know what death is like and there's no one to tell me what comes after it, I'll keep pretending. I will keep trying to remember.\""

      "New Year's Day commemorates the passing of time and the start of a new chapter, so it is fitting that the same day also presents an opportunity to breathe new life into thousands of creative works nearly a century old. As of Jan. 1, 2026, characters like early Betty Boop and Nancy Drew, and a variety of popular movies, books and songs, have entered the the public domain.",
      "They join a growing list of cultural icons that are no longer under copyright protection, including Popeye the Sailor Man and the \"Steamboat Willie\" version of Mickey Mouse.",
      "List of popular intellectual property entering the public domain in 2026",
      "The year 2026 marks the first time that copyrighted books, films, songs and art published in the '30s enter the U.S. public domain. As of Jan. 1, protections have expired for published works from 1930 and sound recordings from 1925.",
      "Here are some of the most notable works that are now available for free use by anyone:",
      "\"The Murder at the Vicarage\" by Agatha Christie, the first novel featuring elderly amateur detective Miss Marple.\"The Secret of the Old Clock\" by Carolyn Keene, the first appearance of teen detective Nancy Drew, and three follow-ups.\"The Little Engine That Could\" by Watty Piper.Fleischer Studios' \"Dizzy Dishes,\" the first cartoon in which Betty Boop appears.Disney's \"The Chain Gang\" and \"The Picnic,\" both depicting the earliest versions of Mickey's dog Pluto.The initial four months of \"Blondie\" comic strips by Chic Young, featuring the earliest iterations of the titular character and her then-boyfriend, Dagwood.The film \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" directed by Lewis Milestone, Best Picture winner at the 3rd Academy Awards.\"King of Jazz,\" directed by John Murray Anderson, Bing Crosby's first appearance in a feature film.\"Animal Crackers,\" directed by Victor Heerman and starring the Marx Brothers.\"The Big Trail,\" directed by Raoul Walsh, John Wayne's first turn as leading man.\"But Not For Me,\" music by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin.\"Georgia on My Mind,\" music by Hoagy Carmichael, lyrics by Stuart Gorrell.\"Dream a Little Dream of Me,\" music by Fabian Andre and Wilbur Schwandt, lyrics by Gus Kahn.\"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight,\" music by Al Sherman, lyrics by Al Lewis.Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",

      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

    "story": [
      "Actor George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney were\u00a0granted French citizenship\u00a0because \"they contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France's international influence and cultural outreach,\" the French government said Wednesday, defending their naturalization that was questioned by a junior French minister.",
      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \"Ocean's\" series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",
      "Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior minister at the Interior Ministry, expressed misgivings Wednesday that some of the Clooneys' new French compatriots may think that the star couple was granted special treatment. The actor speaks only what he himself says is \"horrible, horrible\" French.",
      "\"The message being sent is not good,\" Vedrenne said in an interview with broadcaster France Info. \"There is an issue of fairness that, in my eyes, is absolutely essential.\"",
      "President Trump piled on the criticism against the move, saying France was welcome to the two-time Academy Award winner, a long-time vocal critic of the U.S. leader.",
      "\"Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday.",
      "He added, \"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies. He wasn't a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021 and Clooney has said that it's their primary residence. Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized. It wasn't clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \"s\" at the end.",

    "summary": "FDA-approved semaglutide drug is the first GLP-1 pill for weight loss available in the U.S., according to drugmaker Novo Nordisk.",
    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk said that people who used the oral medication during phase 3 of clinical trials lost about 14% of their body weight, while those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17%.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:11:22 -0500",
    "summary": "In his new wellness book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream,\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel goes beyond the basics of eating, exercise and sleep, to the importance of being happy, social engagement, and recommended behaviors (like \"don't be a schmuck\") that can benefit longevity.",
    "story": [
      "It may not sound like a New Year's resolution, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel is serving up some unusual advice as you start out 2026: Eat your ice cream. \"Ice cream will make you happy, and that's very important,\" he explained.",
      "I asked, \"Why would I live longer eating ice cream?\"",
      "\"Ice cream is a good dairy product; it's got protein, its saturated fats are in a globule, so it doesn't affect you as much as saturated fats in meats and other things,\" he said. \"Plus, you typically do it socially with someone else. And you know, being happy is a very important part of living a long time.\"",
      "\"I feel like your saying 'eat your ice cream' is like 'Don't stress out as much about life. Be more social,'\" I said.",
      "\"We're here for only 75, 85, 90 years. You've got to make life enjoyable. You've got to make it fulfilling,\" he said.",
      "The prominent oncologist and health policy expert is taking a different approach in his new wellness book, called,\u00a0\"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.). He said, \"I want people to stop obsessing. make it part of your life. You should like exercising, you should like eating well. Otherwise, you're not going to do it for years and years and decades, which is what's necessary for a long, healthy life.\"",
      "The doctor's health handbook does include the basics of what to eat, how to exercise, and the all-important reminder that sleep is fundamental to wellness. But it goes beyond that, with behaviors that include \"Don't be a schmuck.\"",
      "\"One of the things that is I think core to the book is, stop doing things that aren't good for your health,\" Emanuel said. \"'Don't be a schmuck' is my father's reference to us when we were being stupid. And so, there are lots of things that we do as human beings that can be schmucky: smoking, vaping, doing drugs, not taking your vaccines. I don't agree with the current administration, and they're dead wrong on this.\"",
      "Also on the so-called schmuck list: alcohol.",
      "I asked, \"This is what everybody wants to know about: the right amount of alcohol, or no alcohol?\"",
      "Emanuel said, \"There has been a lot of research on alcohol, so here's the way I distill it: The safest level is probably zero. There are some studies, and we should be clear, where it's half a cup a day, three cups a week.\"",
      "\"Nobody drinks a half a glass of wine,\" I said.",
      "\"So, you drink every other day,\" Emanuel said. \"On the other hand, 60, 65% of the public drinks. You're not going from 65% to zero. So, you have to give people reasonable advice. And the reasonable advice is, first of all, no binge drinking, that's really bad for you. Don't drink alone. That's really bad for you. If you're using alcohol as a lubricant for social interaction, which many people do, that's probably good; you're getting some benefit from the social interaction.\"",
      "Social interactions \u2013 a consistent theme for Emanuel \u2013 is something he learned at a young age, growing up with brother Ari, a super-agent in Hollywood, and his other brother Rahm, the former mayor of Chicago and ambassador, who may be running for president of the United States.",
      "I asked, \"What is it that your parents taught all of you that has led you, I mean, you're all incredibly successful?\"",
      "\"Now you're gonna make me cry,\" Emanuel said, \"because every time I talk about my parents and our growing up, I tend to cry. They taught us how to be social and interact with people. They also taught us how to be responsible. One of the things my mom did in raising us is, you know, get out of the house and go occupy yourself. Rahm and I went to school, I was six in first grade, and he was in nursery school. I had to take him from school, walk two blocks across a busy street, get on a bus, pay the car fare, get off at the right spot. I learned a huge amount of responsibility, taking care of my brothers.",
      "\"The other thing I think they did, which was super-important for us, is we all slept in the same bedroom. We were a unit. Yes, we fought endlessly. And you know, I like to joke with people, we didn't go to bed until there was blood, you know, because of all the fights. But we were also each other's best friends.\"",
      "His takeaway: relationships matter.",
      "Emanuel also lists lifestyle choices he considers \"anti-wellness,\" like chronic stress, a fast-food diet, social media, and dining alone.",
      "\"I think people would agree with all of those, with the exception of dining alone,\" I said. \"A lot of people go to a restaurant or get home from work, and dine alone.\"",
      "Emanuel said that should be an occasional thing: \"Don't make it every day. And you know, if you find yourself dining alone, what you should do is call up a friend. If you're sitting at a bar, right, and you're dining there, ask the person next to you, you know, 'Have you been to this restaurant before? What do you do? Why are you here?' Yeah, strike up a conversation. We underplay those casual conversations and how important they are for us.\"",
      "His book also discusses retirement: \"Retirement leads to more rapid cognitive decline for people. I say to people, don't retire. And if you're gonna retire, you have to plan retirement well, so that you stay engaged, you stay mentally sharp. And that doesn't mean, 'Well, you know, I'm gonna try to play the saxophone one day.'\"",
      "\"But Dr. Emanuel, a lot of retired people like to buy books, and watch 'Sunday Morning,'\" I said.",
      "\"Well, if they're buying books and staying mentally engaged that way, if they're going to volunteer, say, or they're talking to friends, or they're taking up a new hobby seriously, all of that is excellent, highly endorsed,\" he replied.",
      "\"Meaning don't retire the mind, or retire your social engagement?\"",
      "\"Yes, and it's very important, you've got to be deliberate about it. You can't let nature take its course.\"",
      "So, what is his biggest piece of advice for us in 2026? \"Build your social relationships,\" he said. \"It's definitely the most important thing for long-lasting health and happiness.\"",

      "In his new book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and health policy expert, discusses longevity, and how to best differentiate valid and effective health and wellness advice from \"the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Emanuel on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 4!",
      "\"Eat Your Ice Cream\" by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D.",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Anyone looking for advice on wellness and longevity confronts a tsunami of books, newspaper articles, podcasts, newsletters, and videos from an enormous range of sources: scientific experts, medical practitioners, health systems, journalists, patients, influencers, gurus, quacks. Traditional media offer loads of good advice, often in responsibly edited and well-sourced sections dedicated to \"wellness.\" But the sheer amount of it can be difficult to keep up with, and sometimes the guidance can be downright contradictory.",
      "For anyone wading through the torrent of health and longevity advice online, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The so-called \"must dos\" online range from the medically unproven to the wildly impractical to suggestions so absurd they leave doctors like me baffled\u2014testicle tanning, teen blood transfusions, vaginal steaming, \"rucking\" hikes with a backpack full of weights. Information is coming at us from a firehose, increasingly spewed by hucksters and self-proclaimed sages who have amassed millions of social media followers (and dollars) by promising supposed miracle treatments using medical-sounding language. It's no wonder so many people are confused and frustrated.",
      "Shouting to be heard over it all are real physicians and health experts offering sound but sometimes conflicting advice. All of it together can swamp even those who are most assiduous about their health. Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

      "As part of the September 2025 settlement, Amazon is offering $1.5 billion in refunds to eligible customers, as well as paying a $1 billion civil penalty. The FTC had alleged that Amazon duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it hard for customers to cancel their membership.",

      "In total, 88 jurisdictions \u2014 including 22 states and 66 cities and counties \u2014 are slated to increase their minimum wages at some point in 2026, according to a recent\u00a0report from the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an advocacy organization for workers.",
      "The wage floor will reach or exceed $15.00 per hour, double the amount of the federal minimum wage, in most of those locations.",
      "The bulk of the wage boosts took effect starting Jan. 1, 2026. For instance, the minimum rose to $17.00 at the start of this year in New York City, Long Island and Westchester County.",
      "Despite repeated attempts to raise the federal minimum wage, the national baseline hourly rate has remained at $7.25 since 2009. In the meantime, many states and municipalities have boosted their wage floors through a patchwork of ballot measures and legislation. These changes are often framed as a way to combat inflation, which has cooled since 2022 but remains a pain point for many Americans.",

      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Polymarket wager could violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), a federal law regulating futures and options trading, experts told CBS News. Specifically, the CEA prohibits gambling on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.",
      "Kelleher also said the incident highlights the potential risks for other prediction market users.",
      "\"Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,\" he said.",
      "Piepgrass told CBS News that the Maduro bet marks a \"flashpoint\" in the debate around what he characterized as inadequate regulation of such markets. Enabling insiders with access to confidential information to place bets on the trading forums would disadvantage other customers, he said.",

    "story": [
      "Representatives from petroleum giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil are planning to meet with the Trump administration later this week to discuss Venezuela, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The meeting is expected to take place Thursday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, one source familiar with the matter said.",
      "The meetings come as President Trump pushes U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela's oil industry, following the U.S. military's capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday.",
      "Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil industry has languished after years of mismanagement, underinvestment and tight U.S. sanctions. The country produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to OPEC, most of which is exported to China \u2014 representing less than 1% of global oil production.",
      "Chevron is the only major U.S. petroleum company that currently operates in Venezuela under a special license from the Treasury Department. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007, after Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, demanded that Venezuela's state-run oil company take majority stakes in the country's oil ventures.",
      "It remains uncertain whether U.S. firms will reinvest in Venezuela right away. Experts say it would take companies years to build out their operations in Venezuela, and many oil companies could tread lightly because of political uncertainty.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said: \"All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime. American oil companies will do an incredible job for the people of Venezuela and will represent the United States well.\"",
      "A Chevron spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News on whether it plans to boost production in Venezuela, saying it \"remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Shares in other U.S. energy sector players also rose, with oil services giants Halliburton and Schlumberger both adding more than 10%. The price of U.S. crude rose 1.4% to $58.13 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, climbed 1.2% to $61.50.",
      "Oil industry players drifted up amid a broader surge in stocks on Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 549 points, or 1.2%, to close at an all-time high of 48,977. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.",
      "After Maduro's capture, President Trump said U.S. oil companies would participate in rebuilding Venezuela's decaying energy infrastructure.",
      "Venezuela's oil sector produces 750 million to 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data. The U.S., the world's largest oil producer, produces 13.5 million barrels per day, while No. 2 Saudi Arabia pumps an estimated 10 million barrels.",
      "Yet while Venezuela's oil production has plunged in recent decades due to government mismanagement, underinvestment and the impact of U.S. sanctions, the country is sitting on proven reserves of more than 300 billion barrels \u2014 the world's largest oil patch.",
      "While experts think that significantly boosting oil production in Venezuela could cost upwards of $100 billion and take at least a decade, some Wall Street analysts foresee a potentially faster upgrade.",
      "\"Venezuela could realistically achieve production levels of 1.3\u20131.4 [million barrels per day] within two years of a political transition,\" analysts with J.P. Morgan Markets said in a report.",
      "\"U.S. companies that may become involved in Venezuela are primarily major oil firms like Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. Chevron already has a presence in the country, while others are exploring opportunities to recover previously expropriated assets and invest in Venezuela's massive heavy crude reserves,\" J.P. Morgan added. \"There may also be interest from U.S Gulf Coast refiners seeking less costly sources of heavy oil.\"",
      "Venezuela produces thick crude with high amounts of sulfur and metal that is widely used to produce diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, among other uses.",
      "Despite Venezuela's ample oil reserves, David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at investment adviser Capital Economics, said the business case for investing in the country's weakened energy sector is questionable, pointing to the high projected costs of extracting its \"heavy\" oil reserves.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk said that people who used the oral medication during phase 3 of clinical trials lost about 14% of their body weight, while those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17%.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 22:55:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive served as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

      "Elon Musk's Grok, the chatbot developed by his company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" on the AI platform that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "The admission comes after multiple users alleged on social media that people are using Grok to generate suggestive images of minors, in some cases stripping them of clothing they were wearing in original photos.",
      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming. Without strong safeguards and independent detection, manipulated media can \u2014and will \u2014 be weaponized,\" Copyleaks said in a blog post.",
      "\"Spicy mode\" controversy",
      "Grok has previously drawn scrutiny before for generating sexually inappropriate content. Grok Imagine, xAI's artificial intelligence video generation platform,\u00a0unveiled \"Spicy Mode\" last year, framing it as a way for creators to tell \"edgier\" and \"more visually daring narratives.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:57:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed California ballot initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires, with the revenue funneled toward health care and education.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed billionaire wealth tax in California is sparking debate over whether the measure, if passed, would lead to more harm than good if ultrawealthy residents in the state flee to other locales.",
      "Under the proposed ballot initiative, California would institute a one-time tax of 5% on the state's estimated 255 billionaires. While wealth taxes aren't new, the proposal has sparked pushback from some of America's richest citizens and their allies, who claim it could drive the state's billionaires to leave the state and discourage entrepreneurs from creating businesses.",
      "By contrast, advocates of the tax emphasize that billionaires' fortunes are growing much faster than the income of ordinary Americans.",
      "\"The billionaire class had their wealth nearly triple in the last six years, and a one-time wealth tax will only put a 5% constraint on their wealth accumulation,\" Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told CBS News. \"It will not significantly impact their lives, their consumption or spending habits.\"",
      "Others warn that California could face a revenue shortfall if the state's wealthiest residents \u2014 who already pay relatively high tax rates \u2014 decamp for other states to avoid the tax.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously opposed earlier wealth tax proposals in the state, saying that the idea is \"going nowhere in California,\" while billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a New York resident, spoke out against the California proposal in a December 29 social media\u00a0post.",
      "\"I am opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences that have occurred in every country that has launched such a tax,\" Ackman wrote.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed California billionaire tax and its potential economic impact.",
      "What is the billionaire wealth tax?",
      "The billionaire wealth tax is a\u00a0proposed ballot measure created by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), a union representing more than 120,000 health care workers and patients in California.",
      "If passed, the measure would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of the state's billionaires, although it would not tax their income. According to California's attorney general, the tax would be applied to assets including:",

      "Businesses",
      "Securities such as stocks and bonds",
      "Art",
      "Collectibles",
      "Intellectual property",
      "Real estate and some pensions and retirement accounts also would be excluded from the tax.",
      "If voters pass the initiative, billionaires in the state would have to pay the tax in 2027, although they could opt to spread the payments across five years for an additional annual nondeductible charge of 7.5% of the remaining unpaid balance, according to the text of the proposal.",
      "How would the tax revenue be used?",
      "About 90 cents of every $1 raised by the tax would be spent on health care, while the remaining 10 cents would be earmarked for food assistance or education, the proposal states.",
      "According to the SEIU-UHW, the impetus for the billionaire tax stems from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which includes about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is slated to lose $190 billion in funding over the next decade due to those cuts, according to the proposal.",
      "\"The purpose of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ... is to protect access to high-quality, equitable health care, and to support funding for kindergarten through grade fourteen public education and food assistance programs, by raising revenue from a one-time tax on billionaire wealth,\" the proposal states.",
      "How much money could the billionaire tax raise for California?",
      "California would likely raise \"tens of billions of dollars from the wealth tax,\" according to a Dec. 11 analysis\u00a0by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "However, the group noted that quantifying the exact amount potentially raised by the tax is difficult because it's unclear what actions billionaires might take to reduce their tax burden, and because much of their wealth is based on stock prices, which continuously fluctuate, the analysis noted.",
      "What steps are needed to pass the wealth tax?",
      "First, the measure needs to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, with Ballotpedia putting the number at about 875,000. If it draws sufficient public support, the measure would appear on the state's ballot in the November general election.",
      "Once on the ballot, the measure would pass if it received a majority approval.",
      "Do the rich move when facing wealth taxes?",
      "Some critics of wealth taxes contend that such policies drive rich Americans to move to low-tax states. Yet\u00a0previous research has found that millionaires generally don't relocate just to get a tax cut.",
      "Massachusetts offers a recent example. The state introduced a 4% tax on millionaires in 2023, with the new revenue helping fund free school lunch for the state's schoolchildren. While some millionaires may have left to avoid the tax, a\u00a0May analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts rose nearly 39% in the two years after the tax took effect.",
      "Have any billionaires announced plans to move over the California tax proposal?",
      "It is unclear whether a one-time tax on billionaires, with their much deeper bank accounts, could spur an exodus in the state. Critics of the proposal have noted that tech billionaire Peter Thiel announced on Dec. 31 that his private investment firm, Thiel Capital, has opened a Miami office.",
      "The new location \"will complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles, California,\" according to the statement, which didn't mention the California proposal.",
      "Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded in 2017 by billionaire tech investor David Sacks\u00a0said on December 31 that it had opened a new office in Austin, Texas. The firm added that Sacks, who also serves as a White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, had relocated to Austin earlier that month, although it didn't mention the proposed wealth tax. He had previously resided in San Francisco.",

      "The company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Sales also declined in the fourth quarter, tumbling 15.6% to 418,227 vehicles, short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "China's BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla has struggled amid heightened competition from rival automakers, as well as a backlash from some consumers over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. Musk had headed up the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he oversaw cuts to the government workforce and some funding programs before stepping back in May\u00a0to refocus on Tesla.",
      "At the same time, the expiration last fall of the $7,500 EV tax credit likely hurt demand as it removed an incentive that had enticed some consumers to buy or lease electric vehicles, which tend to be pricier than gas-powered cars.",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock finished 2025 with a gain of roughly 11%, as investors hope Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make the company a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.",
      "Although Tesla's sales came in lower than analysts had forecast, the results were better than some had feared, noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Investors, meanwhile, are betting that Tesla's other businesses \u2014 its energy unit and its push into robotics, including a humanoid robot and a robotaxi service \u2014 can serve as growth engines.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\" Ives said in a report.",
      "He added that Tesla's core automotive division is facing \"a more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla rose $4.16, or 0.9%, to $453.88 in early trading Friday.",
      "Cheaper Tesla models",
      "The latest quarter was the first reporting period that includes sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3, which Tesla unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 sells for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.",
      "Tesla faces fierce competition both abroad and in the U.S. from rival EV makers. BYD \u2014 known as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" \u2014 now dominates China's highly competitive EV market, which is the world's largest.",
      "While BYD vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., its sales in Europe, Australia and other regions around the world are surging, thanks partly to pricing that is generally lower than Tesla's and other U.S. automakers, according to the BBC.",

      "\"It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\" said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \"I'm incredibly disappointed that there hasn't been more action.\"",
      "Subsidies helped reduce costs since pandemic",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It's a strain for the 49-year-old but one he's willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker's monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",
      "Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, spoke with CBS News during the congressional stalemate in October and said she \"couldn't afford\" health insurance without the subsidies.",
      "\"I'd have to cancel my insurance,\" Hunt said, joking that her insurance would consist of \"thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job in 2025. Without the subsidies, she expected her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month. \"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "Many expected to go without coverage",
      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "The impact could be greatest in Florida, which has the largest number of ACA enrollees of any state \u2014 more than 4.7 million, according to KFF data. Texas is next, with more than 3.9 million, followed by California, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "Kylie Barrios, a 30-year-old Florida resident, said she expected to be among those losing coverage.",
      "\"Our health insurance premium is effectively tripling from 2025 to 2026,\" she told CBS News in December, saying it would rise from about $900 to $2,500.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she'll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter. She can't afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Mr. Trump's big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it's unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don't understand what it's really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\"Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\" said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \"They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\"",
      "Barrios, who said she has generally voted Republican, said she would like politicians to \"act on those values that they ... claim to protect.\"",
      "\"The whole system feels as though it's failed and isn't advocating for me as a small business owner, as somebody who wants to become a mom and have a family,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Steep U.S. import duties targeting 13 Italian pasta makers will be sharply reduced, Italy's foreign ministry said on Jan. 1.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. has rolled back proposed steep tariffs on Italian-made pasta, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Italy's foreign ministry both said Thursday.",
      "The Commerce Department has sharply reduced a proposed duty on 13 Italian pasta makers, cutting the rate from as high as 92% to as little as 2.26%, Italy's foreign ministry said Jan. 1. The duties would have been imposed on top of existing 15% tariffs on most imports from the European Union.",
      "The Trump administration had proposed the antidumping levies after a review found that Italian pasta producers, including Barilla, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold products at artificially low prices that undercut U.S. manufacturers. Together, the 13 pasta producers account for 16% of imported pasta from Italy to the United States, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "Had the higher duties taken effect, U.S. shoppers could have faced steeply higher prices for Italian-made pasta, and some Italian producers might have stopped shipping to U.S. retailers, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The recalculation of the duties is a sign that U.S. authorities recognize our companies' genuine willingness to cooperate,\" the foreign ministry said.",
      "La Molisana pasta imports will be tariffed at a rate of 2.26%, the foreign ministry said, while Garofalo will face nearly 14% tariffs, and 11 additional pasta brands will be subject to a 9% import duty.",
      "A spokesperson for the Commerce Department told CBS News that the new antidumping rates were based on an \"evaluation of additional comments received\" after the proposed duty rates were determined.",
      "\"This post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination, and reflects Commerce's commitment to a fair, transparent process. Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The final results of Commerce's review will be announced in March, after which the duties will go into effect.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u00a0said\u00a0on Wednesday it is postponing tariff increases on imported upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities by a year, citing ongoing negotiations with trading partners.",
      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",
      "\"The United States will therefore delay the increase in tariff rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities that was set to take place on January 1, 2026, under the September 29, 2025, Proclamation for an additional year,\" it added.",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court ruling on New Year's Eve blocked Hawaii from enforcing a\u00a0climate change tourist tax\u00a0on cruise ship passengers, a levy that was set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, arguing that the new law violates the U.S. Constitution by taxing cruise ships for entering Hawaii ports. They also argued it would make cruises more expensive.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passenger, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake last week upheld the law, and the plaintiffs appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. government intervened in the case and also appealed Otake's ruling.",

      "\"We remain confident that Act 96 is lawful and will be vindicated when the appeal is heard on the merits,\" Toni Schwartz, spokesperson for the Hawaii attorney general's office, said in an email.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:00:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The average cost of a conventional 30-year U.S. mortgage continues to edge down, while rates on other home loans fell to less than 5.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell to its lowest level of 2025 this week, a boost for prospective home buyers.",
      "The average long-term mortgage rate dipped to 6.15% from 6.18% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. That's the lowest average long-term rate since October 3, 2024, when it dipped to 6.12% before shooting back up. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.91%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell this week to 5.44% from 5.5% the previous week. A year ago it averaged 6.13%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.14% at midday Wednesday, down a touch from last week's 4.15%.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month.",
      "The Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don't always translate into lower mortgage rates.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to pay cash or finance at current mortgage rates are in a more favorable position than they were a year ago. Home listings are up sharply from 2024, and many sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price as homes take longer to sell, according to data from Realtor.com.",
      "Most homes across U.S. are unaffordable",
      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don't have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market\u00a0is also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared to a year earlier for the first time since May, despite average long-term mortgage rates holding near their low point for the year. Through the first 11 months of this year, home sales are down 0.5% compared to the same period last year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economy-2026-outlook-affordability-rates-jobs-markets/",
    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:32:26 -0500",
    "summary": "From stubbornly high living costs to a softer labor market, economists say these are the forces that will shape the year ahead.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy navigated 2025 with a resilience that surprised many experts, as growth accelerated and inflation remained relatively muted despite the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imports.",
      "Although Americans say they aren't yet feeling the benefits of an expanding economy amid ongoing concerns about the cost of living, many economists expect the U.S. to be on firmer footing next year.",
      "\"I think it'll be a better year,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"Tax cuts will be center stage, and we'll see a broadening out of economic strength.\"",
      "Here are what experts see as the key economic questions facing the U.S. in 2026.",
      "Will affordability improve?",
      "Probably not \u2014 at least not in a way most Americans will feel right away. Inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, but prices remain elevated, squeezing many households and making it harder to cover basic expenses. About 7 in 10 Americans polled by CBS News in December said they were struggling to pay for food, housing and health care, underscoring the affordability issues affecting millions of households.",
      "Rising utility costs are another challenge. Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utilities, up 12% since last year, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.",
      "More broadly, inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target, with the Consumer Price Index in November at 2.7%. For consumers, that means prices for everyday goods and services are still climbing, continuing to strain household budgets.",
      "Inflation should cool to about 2.4% in 2026, according to a December forecast from the Federal Reserve. But that would still leave inflation above the central bank's goal, signaling that \"higher inflation will continue to weigh on family finances\" next year, William Blair economist Richard de Chazal said in a report.",
      "About one-third of Americans think their finances are likely to worsen in the year ahead, primarily driven by inflation concerns, a recent Bankrate\u00a0survey\u00a0found.",
      "Wages will need to outpace inflation for a sustained period before households feel they are getting ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Dec. 10 press conference.",
      "\"We're going to need to have some years where \u2026 nominal wages are higher than inflation for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" he noted.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve continue to cut interest rates?",
      "Another big question is whether the Federal Reserve will continue cutting its benchmark interest rate after three consecutive reductions that began in September.",
      "Although the Fed has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low, the central bank is currently being pulled in two directions. Prices are rising faster than the Fed would like, which could call for higher interest rates if the trend persists or inflation re-ignites in 2026. At the same time, rising unemployment and cooler hiring might require policymakers to further lower rates in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, in December penciled in only\u00a0one additional rate cut for 2026. Yet some economists believe the Fed could make additional cuts, especially if the labor market continues to slow.",
      "President Trump has argued that the Fed should drastically cut its benchmark rate, pressing Fed Chair Jerome Powell to reduce borrowing costs. With Powell's term set to expire in May, Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new chair who is more open to cutting rates.",
      "Will housing become more affordable in 2026?",
      "Homes across the U.S. could be modestly more affordable in 2026, Chen Zhao, head of economics research at real estate company Redfin, told CBS News.",
      "Mortgage rates are likely to remain in the low 6% range, not far off from today's 30-year mortgage rate of about 6.18%, while home\u00a0prices are likely to grow at a slower pace than incomes next year.",
      "\"We're starting to head on a road that leads to better affordability metrics, but it's not going to be an overnight shift,\" she said. \"2026 might not feel all that different than the end of 2025 \u2014 it's a slow process that might take five or six years, but at least we're heading in the right direction.\"",
      "Home prices are projected to dip in about two dozen major U.S. cities in 2026, mostly located in the Southeast and the West, according to a Realtor.com analysis.",
      "Will the job market pick up steam?",
      "Hiring could improve in 2026 as economic growth accelerates and the effects of tariffs fade, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Average payroll gains could rise to an average of 70,000 per month next year, more than double the 32,000 per month average in 2025, economists with the investment bank forecast in a report. They expect wages to climb 2.3% in 2026, accelerating from 1.9% this year.",
      "However, some economists warn that the job market could remain relatively muted as companies turn to artificial intelligence to improve productivity.",
      "Are stocks in a bubble?",
      "A critical question for financial markets this year \u2014 are companies involved in AI overvalued \u2014 is likely to again take center stage in 2026.",
      "The S&P 500 is on track to end the year with a gain of more than 17%, with the index buoyed by artificial intelligence companies and big tech companies. However, some investors are growing cautious about the meteoric rise of AI-related stocks, questioning whether a bubble is forming.",
      "Such bubbles \u2014 when stock valuations run far ahead of underlying fundamentals \u2014 can set the stage for sharp market corrections if investor sentiment sours. Yet stock valuations remain below the levels seen during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics. He expects investment in AI to continue next year as more companies adopt the technology.",
      "Still, although AI stocks are unlikely to crash next year, investors' lofty expectations may be in for a reality check",
      "\"At some point, investors are likely to be disappointed, and the cycle of ever rising investment, expectations and valuations will end, as proved the case with previous equity bubbles,\" Goltermann said in a report.",
      "Overall, forecasters expect a strong stock market performance in 2026. J.P. Morgan in November forecast the S&P 500 will rise 13% to 15% next year, roughly in line with the index's average gain over the last decade.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-17000-commercial-drivers-licenses-delay-revoking-feds-threat-immigrants/",
    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:15:15 -0500",
    "summary": "In light of a suit by immigrants groups, California says it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses despite a federal threat to withhold $160 million in funding.",
    "story": [
      "A week after immigrant groups filed a lawsuit, California said Tuesday it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses until March to allow more time to ensure that truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify for the licenses can keep them.",
      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because, he said, California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "California only sent out notices to invalidate the licenses after Duffy pressured the state to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. An audit found problems like licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's authorization to be in the country expired or licenses where the state couldn't prove it checked a driver's immigration status.",
      "\"California does NOT have an 'extension' to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,\" Duffy posted on the social platform X.",
      "The Transportation Department has been prioritizing the issue ever since a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "California officials said they're working to make sure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms they've put in place. The state had planned to resume issuing commercial driver's licenses in mid-December, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration blocked that.",
      "\"Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy - our supply chains don't move, and our communities don't stay connected without them,\" said DMV Director Steve Gordon.",
      "The Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted. The driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but the non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses, or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",
      "Mumeeth Kaur, the legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said this delay \"is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses because the state was complying.",
      "Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can't speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver's license schools.",
      "And while the federal government says the licenses are illegal and the state says the feds are overreaching, some people in the trucking industry say they're the ones caught in the middle, reports CBS News Sacramento.",

    "summary": "\"Donald Trump and far-right extremists in Congress have repeatedly attempted to rewrite history, and whitewash the horrific events of Jan. 6,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Democrats held an unofficial hearing on Tuesday to mark five years since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, featuring appearances from several groups of witnesses who recounted the riot.",
      "Lawmakers who were part of a since-disbanded special committee that investigated the riot and President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election led the hearing, which was not an official proceeding since Democrats are in the minority. The hearing stretched nearly five hours as a number of witnesses testified on the events of that day and the aftermath.",
      "\"Five years ago today, a violent mob incited by Donald Trump attacked the Capitol as part of a concerted effort to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential Election and halt the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in American history,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said as the hearing kicked off.",
      "In a letter to House Democrats last week, Jeffries said the meeting was meant to highlight the pardons Mr. Trump granted to hundreds of rioters on his first day in office, some of whom have since been arrested on other charges involving guns, drugs and domestic abuse. Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said the hearing would also focus on \"ongoing threats to free and fair elections posed by an out-of-control Trump administration.\"",
      "\"Over the last five years, instead of holding those responsible for the attack accountable, Donald Trump and far-right extremists in Congress have repeatedly attempted to rewrite history, and whitewash the horrific events of Jan. 6,\" Jeffries said Tuesday. \"We will not let that happen.\"",
      "Around 140 police officers were injured in the attack that delayed the certification of President Joe Biden's victory and caused millions of dollars in damages. Mr. Trump has downplayed the actions, praising the rioters as \"patriots\" and \"peaceful people\" and accusing the Biden administration of weaponizing the Justice Department against his supporters.",
      "Pamela Hemphill, the only riot defendant to reject Mr. Trump's pardon, testified at Tuesday's hearing alongside former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou and former Capitol Police officer Winston Pingeon. Hemphill said she was \"deeply grateful for this chance to try to make amends and talk about what happened five years ago,\" adding that \"once I got away from the MAGA cult, and started educating myself about January the 6th, I knew what I did was wrong.\"",
      "\"I pleaded guilty to my crimes, because I did the crime,\" Hemphill said. \"Accepting that pardon would be lying about what happened on January the 6th. I am guilty, and I own that guilt.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and former Reps. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican, and Elaine Luria, a Democrat, were among the witnesses. All three served on the Jan. 6 committee, which issued four criminal referrals to the Justice Department against Mr. Trump.",
      "Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who pushed back against Mr. Trump's allegations of election fraud in his state, also testified. Duncan recalled Mr. Trump's pressure campaign to reject the election results in Georgia and the threats of violence he faced after he refused.",
      "\"At the time, I was a Republican. But there was no way I was going to illegally throw out millions of votes in our state,\" Duncan said. \"Make no mistake about it, it instantly put a target on my back.\"",
      "The former leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, and other Jan. 6 defendants held a march marking the day's events. Tarrio said the event was in honor of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer while the Jan. 6 mob tried to breach the Speaker's Lobby outside the House chamber.",
      "Tarrio was among those who received clemency from Mr. Trump. He was convicted of seditious conspiracy and other charges and sentenced to 22 years in prison.",

    "story": [
      "Gov. Tim Walz, addressing the media's questions for the first time since he announced he was dropping his bid to be reelected to a third term, lashed out at the Trump administration and claimed the state was \"under attack\" by the federal government.",
      "Walz added that he believes Minnesota is \"under assault like no other time in our state's history because of a petty, vile administration that doesn't care about the well-being of Minnesotans.\"",
      "The comments come amid a surge in Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area, as the agency escalates its federal crackdown amid a\u00a0widening fraud scandal\u00a0in Minnesota. The current plans involve a 30-day surge in the area, and may represent one of the largest concentrations of DHS personnel in an American city in recent years. As many as 2,000 federal agents may be involved in the surge, though the department told WCCO on Tuesday, \"For the safety of our officers we do not get into law enforcement footprint.\"",
      "Walz on Tuesday afternoon accused the GOP of wanting \"to tear this state down.\" He also called the renewed federal immigration and fraud crackdown a \"ridiculous surge\" that has not been coordinated with the state. He also called it a \"show\" for the cameras.",
      "\"I don't think any governor in history has had to fight a war against the federal government every single day,\" Walz said.",
      "President Trump posted on the\u00a0social media platform Truth Social\u00a0on Monday afternoon about Walz's decision to drop out of the race. He said, without providing evidence, \"Minnesota's Corrupt Governor will possibly leave office before his Term is up but, in any event, will not be running again because he was caught, REDHANDED, along with Ilhan Omar, and others of his Somali friends, stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars.\"",
      "Walz, on Tuesday, said he has no intention of stepping down until the end of his term.",
      "\"For Republicans here, I have more energy than I've ever had, I am committed to this state more than I've ever been, I love this state with every fiber of my being,\" Walz said.",
      "Walz said he has not chosen a successor for the Democratic candidacy, though Sen. Amy Klobuchar has been approached and is said to be strongly considering running as the Democratic Party candidate. At least a half dozen candidates from the Republican Party have tossed their names into the mix, but Walz said he is \"very confident a Democrat's gonna win this.\"",

    "summary": "After the U.S. deposed Maduro, Trump and top officials did not rule out efforts at overthrow or annexation in other countries. Here's what they've said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump isn't denying the possibility of further American expansion, intervention or annexation efforts in the Western Hemisphere after the military's success in plucking former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from Caracas over the weekend to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S.",
      "In the past, he's threatened to annex Greenland and Canada and predicted the governments in Cuba and Colombia would fall. Now, Mr. Trump is making similar comments again and raising new questions about what he plans to do next.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that under his administration, \"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again\" \u2014 dubbing his approach the \"Don-roe Doctrine,\" a spin on the 19th century foreign policy concept.",
      "It's not clear whether the president will act on his threats against other countries.",
      "Here's the latest on countries and territories that have been the subject of interventionist comments by the president:",
      "Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump has long coveted Greenland and has said it's necessary for U.S. national security, a point he made again Sunday.",
      "\"We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" he said. \"We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security.\"",
      "\"Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"To boost up security in Greenland, they added one more dogsled.\"",
      "The president also named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as special envoy to Greenland last month to represent U.S. interests on the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Landry said in a social media post addressed to Mr. Trump, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"",
      "In March, Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland and told a reporter while he was there that \"what we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself.",
      "A post on Saturday by Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, showed Greenland covered in an American flag accompanied by the comment \"Soon,\" which prompted some to wonder if its annexation is on the horizon.",
      "Asked by CNN on Monday if he could rule out that the U.S. is going to try to take Greenland by force, Stephen Miller said, \"There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking \u2014 of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One over the weekend that while nothing is imminent, \"we'll worry about Greenland in about two months. Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen chided Mr. Trump in a social media post, calling suggestions of annexation \"fantasies\" and writing: \"That's enough now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, the leaders of Europe issued a statement saying \"security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.\"",
      "Iran",
      "Escalating protests over the desperate economic conditions in Iran have been taking place for over a week, and there have been reports that dozens of people have been killed. In response, hours before the Venezuela operation began, Mr. Trump posted on social media that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\" He said the U.S. is \"locked and loaded.\"",
      "The president said Sunday of the demonstrations in Iran, \"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.\"",
      "In June, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Iran's major nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, in an effort to destroy its nuclear enrichment capacity.",
      "Cuba",
      "On the way back to Washington Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"Cuba looks like it's ready to fall,\" adding that he didn't know \"if they're going to hold out.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks Saturday indicated Cuba's leaders should be worried: \"If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit.\" A day later, on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" he said of Cuba, \"they're in a lot of trouble.\"",
      "Though he didn't detail any plans for Cuba or its leaders, Rubio said, \"I don't think it's any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro.\"",
      "Rubio highlighted the close ties between Venezuela and Cuba, noting that Maduro had relied on Cuban bodyguards for protection and said they were in charge of the Venezuelan government's \"internal intelligence.\" The Cuban government said 32 Cubans were killed during the military operation to capture Maduro.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump seems content to see how things play out on the island.",
      "\"I don't think we need any action\" in Cuba, he said, pointing out that Cuba \"now has no income \u2014 they got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They're not getting any of it. And Cuba literally is ready to fall.\"",
      "In the past year, Cuba's oil imports from Venezuela fell by 15%, to 27,400 barrels per day, according to Reuters, which also said that Cuba's supply from Mexico over the same period, from January to October, had dropped by 73%, to just 5,000 bpd.",
      "Colombia",
      "The president appears to have less patience for Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he has accused of illegal drug production and trafficking.",
      "\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday. Asked whether he was threatening to undertake a military operation in Colombia, the president replied, \"It sounds good to me. You know what \u2026 they kill a lot of people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has claimed that cocaine production has spiked during Petro's presidency, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced sanctions on Petro in October because he \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Petro has accused the U.S. of violating international law with its attacks on alleged drug boats, which have now killed at least 115 people, and he suggested that some innocent civilians may have been killed in the strikes. The U.S. denies that any innocent civilians have been killed in any of the boat strikes.",
      "Petro \u2014 who once belonged to a guerilla group \u2014 warned Mr. Trump against taking action in his country, writing on X that he \"swore never to touch a weapon again,\" but \"for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want.\"",
      "Canada",
      "While Mr. Trump has in the past talked about making Canada the \"51st state,\" he has not brought it up again since the Venezuela operation.",
      "But Mr. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs against Canada, raising the tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "In October, Mr. Trump threatened to end trade negotiations with Canada after an anti-tariff ad using Ronald Reagan's voice ran in Ontario. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pulled the ad, saying \"our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"",
      "Panama Canal",
      "Mr. Trump argued earlier in his term that the U.S. should regain control over the strategic Panama Canal \u2014 drawing flak from Panama's government. The U.S. oversaw the canal's construction in the early 20th century and controlled it for decades, but began handing the canal and surrounding land back over to Panama in 1979.",
      "He claimed in March that he was \"reclaiming the Panama Canal,\" referring to a deal by a U.S.-led consortium to buy a controlling stake in the company that operates ports near the canal. Panama's president accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "What is the Monroe Doctrine?",
      "In 1823, America's fifth president, James Monroe, outlined before Congress the U.S.' policy toward its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. It was initially intended to ward off European colonialism, but the Monroe administration also wanted to increase the U.S.' influence and trading alliances.",
      "During the Cold War, the U.S. cited the Monroe Doctrine to be used as a defense against the expansion of communism in Latin America.",
      "The phrase \"Don-roe Doctrine\" first appeared on the cover of the New York Post last year.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration plans to halt billions of dollars in federal funding for social services programs in five states led by Democrats following allegations of fraud, a Department of Health and Human Services official said Tuesday.",
      "The move will freeze $7 billion for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, nearly $2.4 billion for the Child Care Development Fund and roughly $870 million for social services grants that largely benefit children. The states affected are Minnesota, New York, California, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "The New York Post was first to report that HHS would withhold the funding.",
      "\"For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,\" Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement. \"Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes. We will ensure these states are following the law and protecting hard-earned taxpayer money.\"",
      "The Illinois Department of Human Services said it has not yet received any notification or communication about impacts to its federal funding.",
      "\"This is yet another politically-motivated action by the Trump Administration that confuses families and leaves states with more questions than answers. IDHS will provide an update if it is made aware of program or funding changes,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The decision by the Trump administration comes after HHS announced last week that it froze federal child care funding for Minnesota because of \"blatant fraud\" in public-assistance programs.",
      "More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of fraud schemes that have been uncovered in Minnesota since 2021. Prosecutors estimate the the total amount of fraud could reach $9 billion. The scandal started with a $250 million COVID-era scheme involving a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, which was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program.",
      "Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered \"large-scale fraud\" in a housing program for seniors and people with disabilities, and a program that provides services to children with autism. The Trump administration is also probing claims of fraud by day care centers in Minnesota, which gained national attention after a conservative YouTube personality named Nick Shirley posted a video that showed him visiting federally backed child care centers around Minneapolis and finding no children there.",
      "CBS News visited several of the centers named by Shirley and found that all but two of the facilities have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months.",
      "President Trump has criticized Minnesota leaders for its handling of the scandal and attacked Somali immigrants, claiming they have \"ripped off\" the state. Many, but not all, of the defendants charged in the fraud schemes are of Somali descent.",
      "Mr. Trump has attacked California, led by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, as \"more corrupt\" than Minnesota. He said Tuesday in a Truth Social post that \"the fraud investigation of California has begun.\" The president has not provided evidence of wide-scale fraud in California social services and did not provide further details about a probe involving the state.",
      "Beyond Minnesota, the Trump administration has also not put forth evidence of sweeping fraud schemes in social services in New York, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "Still, over the past several months the Trump administration has turned off the spigot of funding to Democrat-led states and cities, particularly during the historic government shutdown last year. Mr. Trump paused billions of dollars for infrastructure and climate projects, and slashed disaster preparedness grants.",

    "story": [
      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",
      "But there's more at play here, including a valuable shipping route and access to mineral resources.",
      "Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory:",
      "\"It's so strategic right now\"",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "Greenland's underground resources",
      "Greenland has reserves of oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Most Greenlanders don't want to be American",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that his country wants good relations with the U.S. and did not \"think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight, and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation.\"",
      "A poll conducted a year ago showed that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News ahead of a visit last year to the island by Vice President JD Vance and his wife.",
      "A brief history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency.",
      "It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, and the European nation carried on as a colonial ruler of Greenland until 1953, when it fully laid out its relations with the island as a semi-autonomous territory.",

    "summary": "Top Trump aide Stephen Miller says it's the \"formal position\" of the White House that Denmark's territory of Greenland \"should be part of the U.S.\"",
    "story": [
      "European leaders released a joint statement Tuesday, outlining the importance of Arctic security, but stressing that \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" hours after White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said it was \"the formal position of the U.S. government... that Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Miller also said, in an interview Monday with CNN, that \"the United States is the power of NATO. For the United States to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend NATO and NATO interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Greenland has been a semi-autonomous  territory of Denmark, and has been tied to the small European nation for 300 years, though it has its own elected government. The largest island in the world, it is located to the northeast of Canada and is about the size of  Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to  only around 60,000 people.",
      "Its  location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both  economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "\"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up. We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries,\" the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the U.K. and Greenland said in their joint statement on Tuesday.",
      "\"Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them. The United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally and through the defense agreement between the Kingdom of Denmark and the United States of 1951,\" the U.S. allies said.",
      "\"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",
      "On Monday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance.",
      "\"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\" Frederiksen told local media on Monday. \"That is, including our NATO, and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\"",
      "When asked Tuesday if the U.S. would use military force to take over Greenland, Miller told CNN: \"The United States should have Greenland as part of the United States. There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking, of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers pushed back against the idea of asserting U.S. control over Greenland.",
      "Democratic Rep. Steny H. Hoyer and Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who co-chair the bipartisan Congressional Friends of Denmark Caucus, said in a joint statement that \"sabre-rattling about annexing Greenland is needlessly dangerous.\"",
      "They said any U.S. attack on Greenland \"would tragically be an attack on NATO.\"",
      "\"We already have access to everything we could need from Greenland,\" the two lawmakers said, noting that Denmark's government has already given the U.S. permission to deploy additional military forces there, or to build more missile defense infrastructure on the island.",

LaMalfa died during the surgical procedure, the sheriff's department said, and the coroner's unit is conducting an investigation to determine the cause of death.",
      "\"Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America,\" Majority Whip Tom Emmer said in a post on X. \"Our prayers are with Doug's wife, Jill, and their children.\"",
      "Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan, the chair of the House Republican Conference, said LaMalfa \"cared deeply about his constituents and worked tirelessly to represent their voices, values, and livelihoods in Congress.\"",
      "In a speech to House Republicans in Washington on Tuesday, President Trump remembered LaMalfa as a \"fantastic person\" and \"great, great member.\" The president said LaMalfa died on Monday, and that he was \"really saddened by his passing.\"",
      "\"He was a defender of everybody, and our hearts go out to his wife Jill and his entire family,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He was our friend. All of us, every one of us.\"",
      "The congressman represented California's 1st Congressional District in the northeastern part of the state and served as chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus.",
      "The California Republican was a fourth-generation rice farmer and business owner. He was known as a prominent voice on agriculture and rural issues in Congress, and previously served in the California State Assembly and state senate.",
      "LaMalfa's death narrows the already thin GOP majority in the House. With his death and the resignation of Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the party breakdown in the House stands at 218 Republicans and 213 Democrats, with four vacancies.",
      "LaMalfa's district is one of five GOP-held districts that was redrawn under California's\u00a0Proposition 50, which is aimed at making them more favorable Democrats in the midterm elections.",
      "Rep. Richard Hudson, a North Carolina Republican, said in a statement that LaMalfa was a \"principled conservative and a tireless advocate for the people of Northern California.\"",
      "\"He was never afraid to fight for rural communities, farmers, and working families. Doug brought grit, authenticity, and conviction to everything he did in public service,\" Hudson said.",

    "summary": "In a letter to colleagues last week, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced a public meeting, with witness testimony, is being held Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the historic and damaging attack on the U.S. Capitol, millions of dollars in damages have been repaired and clean-up has long been completed. Many of the physical injuries have healed. And President Trump's pardons ended the largest criminal prosecution in American history, while freeing more than 1,500 defendants from criminal liability.",
      "What remains is a poisonous and lingering resentment over the riot and an ongoing battle to preserve the basic facts of what transpired on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The president and some of his supporters have accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Department of Justice against Jan. 6 defendants. In the process, Mr. Trump and surrogates have espoused arguments that are inconsistent with the facts of the cases, the timeline of events and public statistics from the Capitol siege prosecutions.",
      "In a letter to colleagues last week, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced a public meeting, with witness testimony, is being held Tuesday to rebut claims about Jan. 6. Jeffries's letter said the meeting would \"expose the election deniers who hold high-level positions of significance in the executive branch and detail the threats to public safety posed by the hundreds of violent felons who were pardoned on the President's first day in office.\"",
      "Dan Hodges, a local Washington, D.C., police officer who was injured by the attack of the mob, said he is frustrated by an ongoing \"rewriting\" of the history of Jan. 6.",
      "\"Five years ago I thought: This has to be the most videotaped crime in American history. It's just so much evidence. There's no way anyone can possibly deny what occurred here,\" Hodges said in an interview. \"But that's exactly what's happening.\"",
      "Hodges, who spoke with CBS News as a citizen, separate from his ongoing role as a police officer, also said, \"The attack was everything it appeared to be on television.\"",
      "Mr. Trump himself \u2014 who has referred to Jan. 6 defendants as \"hostages\" for years \u2014 attempted to reframe or rewrite some of the key issues of the Jan. 6 prosecutions in the hours and days after issuing the pardons. He has claimed many defendants were actually innocent, were only responsible for \"minor\" infractions or were held in unfairly harsh conditions.",
      "At a January 2025 news conference, Mr. Trump said: \"These people have already served years in prison, and they've served them viciously.\" He also claimed Jan 6 rioters had \"served years in jail,\" then added that \"murderers don't even go to jail in this country.\"",
      "His statements excluded the more than 1,000 Jan 6 riot defendants who did not serve years in custody, and the hundreds of pardoned Capitol riot defendants who had not yet gone on trial or who served prison terms for cases in which they pleaded guilty.",
      "Mr. Trump also defended his acts of clemency during the same press conference by saying: \"It's a disgusting prison. It's been horrible. It's inhumane. It's been a terrible, terrible thing.\"",
      "The president did not specify which prison to which he was referring. The imprisoned Jan. 6 riot defendants served time in a wide range of federal prison facilities nationwide, all of which are operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Those include prisons in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, California, Arizona, Ohio, Michigan and Florida, none of which has been singled out as \"inhumane\" by the prison bureau, which Trump now oversees.",
      "Although the local Washington, D.C., jail received criticism for its conditions in 2021 and 2022, when some Jan. 6 defendants were temporarily held there, the jail is not a prison. Nor was the jail used for those who were sentenced to federal prison terms.",
      "In a Fox News interview just days after returning to office, Mr. Trump justified his pardons by arguing, \"most of the people were absolutely innocent,\" which runs counter to many defendants' decision to plead guilty and admit to crimes. His statement is also belied by the perfect trial record secured by prosecutors, who obtained convictions in 100% of the jury trials held for Jan. 6 defendants who pleaded not guilty.",
      "During that interview, Mr. Trump also defended his pardoning of violent rioters who assaulted police, saying: \"They were very minor incidents.\"",
      "According to court records reviewed by CBS News, the injuries to police included violent assaults with a series of makeshift weapons, including bats, poles, bear spray, sticks, chemicals and fists. Around 140 police officers were injured, with some facing cracked ribs, smashed spinal disks and brain injuries, according to the union representing Capitol Police officers. Multiple police officers also died by suicide in the weeks after the siege.",
      "In an October 2025 social media post, Mr. Trump claimed the Biden administration had placed 274 FBI agents among the crowd at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, even though Biden had not yet been sworn in as president. Baseless claims that the riot was orchestrated by the FBI have circulated for years, though Trump-nominated FBI Director Kash Patel has said the 274 agents were deployed to the Capitol for \"crowd control.\"",
      "Some riot defendants have characterized the prosecutions as \"weaponization\" of the federal government by the Justice Department. Others have used the term \"staged,\" \"fake\" or \"fed-surrection\" to allege that the violent riot did not happen as it appeared to on live television across America.",
      "\"Are we not supposed to believe what we saw with our own eyes?,\" asked Rep. Bennie Thompson, a longtime House Democrat from Mississippi who chaired the former House January 6th Select Committee, which aimed to dispel myths and fake claims about the riot. \"We have to keep repeating it, because these individuals with larger microphones keep calling it 'fake news.'\"",
      "The White House declined to comment on remarks Mr. Trump has made about Jan. 6 or those involved, but spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement:\u00a0 \"The media's continued obsession with January 6 is one of the many reasons trust in the press is at historic lows \u2014 they aren't covering issues that the American people actually care about. President Trump was resoundingly reelected to enact an agenda based on securing the border, driving down crime, and restarting our economy \u2014 the President is delivering.\"",
      "House Democrats are expected to call a number of the police victims of the siege as public witnesses at their Tuesday public meeting. Several congressional staffers familiar with the matter told CBS News they expect Democrats to issue public statements Monday and Tuesday to reinforce the facts of the Jan. 6 siege, amid Mr. Trump's claims minimizing the riot.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson's office did not respond to requests for comment about Democrats' planned public meeting or about plans for any formal events to mark the siege.",
      "Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, called Hodges to testify at an October 2025 hearing on political violence. Welch said he wanted the officer's testimony to be public to dispel false narratives about Jan. 6. Several conservatives also testified at the hearing, during which Republican lawmakers highlighted acts of political violence and threats against Mr. Trump and other right-leaning public figures.",
      "\"There's a process to rewrite what happened on January 6 and essentially erase it,\" Welch told CBS News. \"And that's wrong. They're literally in the process of re-writing it.\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who previously chaired a Senate committee that conducted a bipartisan investigation into security failures on Jan. 6, told CBS News, \"Congress and Vice President Pence did our job that day: democracy prevailed.\"",
      "\"While we have come together on a bipartisan basis to strengthen our electoral process, the President's pardons and attempts to rewrite history are an insult to law enforcement and undermine our democracy,\" Klobuchar said.",

    "story": [
      "Five years after the U.S. Capitol attack, some Senate Democrats are introducing new legislation to prevent taxpayer money from being awarded to convicted and now-pardoned rioters.",
      "One of the new Senate bills, reviewed Tuesday by CBS News, would outlaw the establishment of any compensation fund to award money to rioters. Another piece of legislation would prohibit the use of federal tax money to pay for civil legal settlements against Jan. 6 defendants who were convicted of assaulting police.",
      "The latter of the two bills is titled the \"No Settlements for 5 January 6 Law Enforcement Assaulters Act.\" It is sponsored by Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat who serves as vice-chair of the Senate Rules Committee, which has oversight of the Capitol grounds and the U.S. Capitol Police. The legislation is also sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee.",
      "Supporters of some Jan. 6 riot defendants have championed the idea of a reparations fund to reimburse the criminal defendants \u2014 most of whom were pardoned by President Trump shortly after he returned to office last year \u2014 for the cost of their prosecutions and expenses.",
      "Mark McCloskey, an attorney whose social media page says he is \"championing the cause of J6 compensation,\" posted on his X feed in August: \"To all the J6 political prisoners out there- I'm doing everything I can to [expedite] the establishment of a claims resolution procedure so we can get you back on your feet and get you some real justice.\"",
      "\"I won't stop fighting and I will never back down,\" he wrote.",
      "The Trump administration has already approved at least one civil settlement in connection with the mob that overran the Capitol on Jan 6, 2021. The Justice Department approved an approximately $5 million settlement to the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer while she breached a smashed window into the House Speaker's Lobby.",
      "It's not clear if the administration is considering other financial settlements with Jan. 6 rioters. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on the new legislation.",
      "When asked about the prospect of Jan. 6 reparation payments, former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn told CBS News: \"This reeks of audacity. Not only did they get a pardon, they are saying they deserve a payday for the crimes they committed.\"",
      "Padilla told CBS News his legislation \"would hold these rioters accountable and protect taxpayers by putting an end to Donald Trump's callous attempt to rewrite history.\"",
      "\"These insurrectionists should still be serving their sentences and paying fines for damages they caused to the Capitol \u2014 not receiving refunds or cash rewards from the Trump Administration,\" Padilla said.",
      "In a statement, Whitehouse said: \"No matter how Trump's MAGA goons now try to twist it, the January 6 attack on our Capitol was an assault on our democracy. Trump's blanket day-one pardons for members of the January 6 mob were a slap in the face to the brave law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line to protect the country.\"",

      "Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil industry has languished after years of mismanagement, underinvestment and tight U.S. sanctions. The country produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to OPEC, most of which is exported to China \u2014 representing less than 1% of global oil production.",
      "Chevron is the only major U.S. petroleum company that currently operates in Venezuela under a special license from the Treasury Department. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007, after Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, demanded that Venezuela's state-run oil company take majority stakes in the country's oil ventures.",

      "The Justice Department said late Monday it is still poring through millions of documents that may be related to Jeffrey Epstein, as the Trump administration grapples with a congressional mandate to release all of its files on the late sex offender.",
      "The legal deadline to make the records public was Dec. 12. But the department has argued the sheer volume of documents that need to be found, uploaded, reviewed, redacted and published has forced it to instead release the files online on a rolling basis, with a series of enormous document dumps over the course of several days in mid-December.",
      "In a legal filing Monday, the Justice Department told a judge it has released about 12,285 documents so far, totaling some 125,575 pages. More than 2 million documents that may need to be released under the law are still \"in various phases of review.\"",
      "That means the department has reviewed less than 1% of its total possible records on Epstein, though it noted that it believes a \"meaningful portion\" of the still-unreviewed documents are duplicates. It also said the documents' page counts vary widely.",
      "The documents that are under review include internal Justice Department and FBI emails, court filings, notes from FBI interviews, records from subpoenas and \"various forms of media,\" the court filing said.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in mid-November, gave the Justice Department 30 days to release a wide swath of files on Epstein and his convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. That includes decades-old records from the earliest federal investigations into Epstein, documents from Epstein and Maxwell's 2019 and 2020 sex trafficking cases and files from the Justice Department's review of Epstein's death by suicide while in pre-trial custody.",
      "The law allows the Justice Department to redact victims' personal information, child sexual abuse material, images that show bodily injuries and a small handful of other categories.",
      "The Manhattan judge in Maxwell's case, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmeyer, has also required the top prosecutor in the district to \"personally certify\" that any grand jury materials that are released have been \"rigorously reviewed\" to take out victims' identities.

      "Over 400 Justice Department lawyers are involved in the review process, the filing said.",
      "It's not clear how long it will take the department to release all of the files, or when the next tranche will be made public. The Justice Department revealed on Christmas Eve that it had discovered over a million new documents, and reviewing them could take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the files, arguing it needs to release them on a rolling schedule in order to protect victims' personal information.",
      "But the department's pace \u2014 and the fact that it missed Congress' deadline \u2014 has drawn backlash from congressional Democrats and Epstein survivors. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused the department of a \"cover-up\" last month.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area, officials tells CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal\u00a0in Minnesota, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations, the agency's investigative arm tasked with fighting transnational crimes, the officials said. They requested anonymity to discuss operations that have not been publicly announced.",
      "The plan is for the agents and officers to oversee a 30-day surge in operations in the Twin Cities area, making the region the first major target of the Trump administration's expanded immigration crackdown in the new year, officials said. Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to probe alleged cases of fraud, building on last month's inspection of dozens of sites in the Minneapolis area.",
      "Officials said U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, who has overseen controversial immigration roundups in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans, is expected to arrive in Minnesota to help lead immigration enforcement efforts, along with an unknown number of U.S. Border Patrol personnel.",
      "The deployment, which began Sunday, represents one of the largest concentrations of DHS personnel in an American city in recent years. The move greatly expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota at a time of heightened political and community tension there.",
      "According to senior law enforcement officials, the surge includes several hundred additional agents from Homeland Security Investigations, as well as hundreds of officers from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations. Tactical units known as Special Response Teams are also slated to be part of the operation, along with a layered command structure of dozens of high-ranking supervisors.",
      "One former law enforcement official described the scale as extraordinary, noting that the number of HSI agents being sent to Minneapolis is roughly equivalent to the entire HSI workforce assigned to the state of Arizona. \"This is a massive resource allocation,\" the official said, adding that Minneapolis is effectively becoming \"the new Chicago,\" referencing past large-scale federal enforcement deployments in Illinois.",
      "Multiple officials told CBS News the total federal presence could ultimately become even larger, with as many as 600 HSI agents and up to 1,500 ICE ERO officers rotating through the Minneapolis area over the course of the month-long deployment.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
      "Late last year, ICE launched an immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, targeting immigrants who had been issued deportation orders, including those from Somalia. As of Dec. 19, ICE had carried out nearly 700 arrests as part of the operation, according to DHS.",
      "The new surge comes amid intense state and federal scrutiny of Minnesota following years of high-profile fraud cases involving federally funded programs. They have included some of the largest pandemic-era and post-pandemic fraud schemes in the country, like the Feeding Our Future case, which led to dozens of indictments and convictions.",
      "Federal prosecutors have charged more than 90 people in Minnesota-based fraud cases since 2021, with more than 60 convictions so far, according to court records. Investigators have revealed the alleged schemes span multiple federal programs, including nutrition, housing stabilization and child care assistance, with potential losses estimated in the billions of dollars.",
      "In recent weeks, federal activity across the Minneapolis area has increased, with HSI agents canvassing businesses and ICE officers conducting arrests in and around immigrant-populated neighborhoods. That uptick in law enforcement activity has prompted protests, confrontations and widespread fear among immigrant communities \u2014 particularly within Minnesota's large Somali-American population.",
      "President Trump has regularly cited Somalia \u2014 often in incendiary terms \u2014 to justify his mass deportation campaign. Last month, Mr. Trump called people from Somalia \"garbage\" and said they \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" the president said. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"",
      "At the same time, Minnesota officials led by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz have pushed back on claims that the state failed to act, pointing to audits, third-party reviews, the appointment of a program-integrity director and the creation of a statewide fraud-prevention council.",
      "But Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection to a third term as criticism has boiled over.",
      "Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News that the governor met with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sunday, as the fellow Democrat considers whether or not to enter the race.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services has frozen $185 million in federal child care payments to Minnesota, citing ongoing fraud concerns. The governor and other state leaders have warned that the move, along with a heightened federal law enforcement presence, risks harming legitimate businesses and families who rely on public assistance programs.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention on Monday announced updated recommendations for childhood vaccines with some significant changes. The new guidelines recommend fewer shots and are likely to face pushback from many doctors and public health experts.",
      "Under the new guidelines, the CDC recommends all children be vaccinated against 11 diseases, a decrease from the 17 immunizations previously recommended.",
      "The vaccines recommended under the new guidelines include diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), as well as varicella (chickenpox). (Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.)",
      "In a second category under the new guidelines, it's recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B.",
      "Finally, in a third category, for children not in high-risk groups, the decision on whether to receive certain vaccines should be based on \"shared clinical decision-making\" between physicians and parents, according to the CDC. Those immunizations include COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B.",
      "\"It's very complicated to try to figure out the risks and the benefits,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said on the \"CBS Evening News.\" \"It's so important to have a health care provider with whom you can discuss this openly and empathetically.\"",
      "He noted, \"The American Academy of Pediatrics calls today's recommendations dangerous and said they're going to continue to give their own recommendations.\"",
      "The changes follow a controversial December recommendation on when children should receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been hand-picked by Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, said in a statement that Monday's announcement \"protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.\"",
      "\"After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,\" he said.",
      "President Trump called the updates \"a far more reasonable schedule, where all children will only be recommended to receive vaccinations for 11 of the most serious and dangerous diseases.\" But parents could still choose to give their children other vaccinations and those will still be covered by insurance, Mr. Trump said.",
      "The assessment compared the U.S. vaccine schedule to those of 20 other developed nations and found that the U.S. is a \"global outlier\" in both the number of diseases addressed and total number of recommended doses, according to the Health and Human Services Department.",
      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0has disputed that, saying the longstanding U.S. recommendations were based on \"robust evidence\" and are \"largely similar across developed countries,\" with some variance due to factors like disease threats, demographics and health care systems.",
      "Dr. Ronald G. Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called Monday's announcement a \"reckless step.\"",
      "\"Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face,\" he said in a statement. The biggest\u00a0measles outbreak\u00a0in more than 30 years has sickened more than 2,000 people across the U.S. Most of those sickened were not vaccinated, and two children died.",
      "Dr. Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota, warned that the change in the CDC's vaccine recommendations will put children at risk.",
      "\"Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\" Osterholm told The Associated Press.",

      "Under heavy guard, former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were flown from a federal jail in Brooklyn to Manhattan on Monday morning to make their first court appearance since being captured by U.S. forces over the weekend.",
      "Surrounded by Drug Enforcement Agency agents, the shackled Maduro shuffled from the helicopter to an armored vehicle, and was then driven to a federal courthouse, where he was greeted by the New York City Police Department and protesters \u2014 on one side of the street were those cheering Maduro's downfall, and on the other were those opposing his capture and detention.",
      "Inside the courtroom, Maduro, clad in a prison jumpsuit, was initially defiant, declaring through a translator that he is a \"decent man,\" innocent of all charges.",

      "At one point, it seemed Maduro was trying to grandstand, but U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein cut him off, like he would anyone, saying he just needed to know Maduro's identity and if he understood his rights and the charges against him.",
      "Maduro\u00a0faces four counts of narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine and weapons-related offenses. He was indicted during President Trump's first term in 2020.

    "summary": "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that he won't seek reelection in a surprise exit from politics less than 18 months after the Democrat was chosen to be the party's nominee for vice president.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Monday that he won't seek reelection, a surprise exit from politics less than 18 months after the Democrat was chosen to be the party's nominee for vice president.",
      "Walz was seeking an unprecedented third straight term as Minnesota's governor. But the 180 came amid intense scrutiny over fraud schemes in the North Star State, which has seen a resurgence in recent weeks.",
      "While Walz is not implicated in the fraud issues, the reality that the schemes have become an urgent problem under his watch has enveloped talk of the Minnesotan governor's future political ambitions.",
      "From VP pick to ending his reelection bid",
      "Walz, a former high school social studies teacher, coach and congressman who served in the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guards, vaulted into the national political scene during the summer of 2024 as Democratic President Joe Biden faced questions about whether he should stay in the presidential race following a disastrous debate performance.",
      "After Biden dropped out of the race and former Vice President Kamala Harris was tapped to lead the ticket, Harris turned to Walz as her pick for vice president, opting for the former football coach from a blue state over contenders from more traditional presidential battlegrounds.",
      "Democrats rallied around Harris and Walz, and the Minnesota governor's stripped-back, folksy style \u2014 like describing Republican candidates as \"weird\" \u2014 seemed to add to the ticket's appeal. But a lackluster performance during that fall's vice presidential debate did little to help the party avoid stinging losses in November 2024.",
      "In the wake of that loss, Walz held nationally-focused town halls in several states while also being seen as a potential candidate for the 2028 presidential election. Last year, he announced he would run for a third term as governor.",
      "An uproar over Minnesota fraud",
      "Walz's name came back into the national spotlight in recent months, amid uproar over a series of multimillion-dollar pandemic fraud schemes in Minnesota. Though Walz isn't implicated in the scheme, he's served as the state's governor since 2019, and his administration has faced years of local scrutiny over their handling of fraud.",
      "During the Biden administration in 2022, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States,\" which revolved around a welfare program that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children. Republican officials have argued for years that Minnesota was slow to act in the scheme, and failed to carry out due diligence. But the issue saw a resurgence late last year.",
      "The criticism over Minnesota fraud rose to the top GOP ranks, and President Trump directed his ire over the issue at Walz, including with a post on Truth Social on Thanksgiving where he used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to describe the Minnesota governor. And the Treasury Department said last month that it would investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia. Meanwhile, House Republicans on the Oversight Committee launched an investigation into Walz's handling of the fraud cases.",
      "Walz: \"I can't give a political campaign my all\"",
      "Scrutiny over the fraud scandal hasn't died down in recent weeks. And in his statement announcing an end to his gubernatorial bid, Walz cited the scheme.",
      "Walz acknowledged that in recent years, \"an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state's generosity,\" adding that \"even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.\"",
      "\"I won't mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies \u2013 in Washington, in St. Paul, and online \u2013 want to make our state a colder, meaner place,\" Walz said. \"They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.\"",
      "Walz outlined his administration's effort to combat fraud, saying \"across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem.\" But he said there's \"more to do,\" and \"the buck stops with me.\"",
      "The second-term governor said while he announced a reelection bid in September, he's come to the conclusion in recent weeks that \"I can't give a political campaign my all,\" specifically citing the fraud scandal.",
      "\"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,\" Walz said. \"So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.\"",
      "In a statement on Walz's decision, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the No. 3 House Republican, simply said, \"Good riddance.\"",

      "Speaking to sailors aboard the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier in Newport News, Virginia, Hegseth said Maduro had no warning the U.S. was closing in until moments before American forces arrived.",
      "\"Nicol\u00e1s Maduro got to meet some great Americans wearing night vision goggles three nights ago,\" Hegseth said. \"He didn't know they were coming until three minutes before they arrived. In fact, his wife said, 'I think I hear aircraft outside.' They didn't know. You know why? Because every single part of that chain did their job.\"",
      "Roughly 200 Americans carried out the overnight raid Saturday at Maduro's residence in downtown Caracas, Hegseth said. Fighter jets and bombers struck Venezuelan air defenses, clearing the way for Delta Force commandos to close in on the compound, where they came under heavy fire.",
      "\"They got off the helicopter, and the bullets were flying all over the place,\" President Trump told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One. \"As you know, one of the helicopters got hit pretty badly, but we got everything back.\"",
      "Several U.S. soldiers were injured in the operation, according to U.S. officials. Dozens of Venezuelans were killed, along with 32 Cuban citizens who were part of Maduro's security detail, Cuba's government said.",
      "\"There was a lot of death on the other side, unfortunately. But a lot of Cubans were killed yesterday trying to protect him,\" Trump said.",
      "Once U.S. forces breached the compound, they intercepted Maduro before he could reach a safe room, officials said. The raid had been rehearsed for months using a replica of Maduro's residence to prepare for multiple scenarios.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the operation was built around repetition and redundancy.",
      "\"We think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we debrief, we rehearse again and again, not to get it right, but to ensure that we cannot get it wrong,\" Caine said.",
      "CIA personnel inside Venezuela had been tracking Maduro's movements since August, including through an agent who penetrated his inner circle and provided key intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",

      "He held a news conference after announcing he'd end his reelection bid. He took no questions, though he said he'd answer some on Tuesday while providing an update on the state's new paid family leave program.",
      "The two-term Democrat and former vice presidential candidate has faced scrutiny in the last several months over his handling of Medicaid fraud, which has cost the state as much as $9 billion, according to a top prosecutor. Walz has stated that his administration is taking aggressive measures to prevent future fraud.",

      "Walz has also been the target of attacks by President Trump. On Thanksgiving, Mr. Trump used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to describe Walz on his Truth Social platform. During a media availability Sunday, Trump called Walz \"a very stupid, low-IQ governor.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Mr. Trump reposted a conspiracy theory video alleging Walz was behind the political assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman.",
      "Hortman, Walz's close friend and political ally, was slain in her home alongside her husband on June 14. The man accused of killing the two of them, as well as injuring state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, faces several federal charges, including two counts of murder.",
      "Walz decried the president's post, calling it \"dangerous, depraved behavior.\"",
      "Walz, a former Congressman and teacher, was first elected governor in 2018. During his tenure, he made several progressive victories, spurred in part by a once-in-a-decade DFL trifecta in the legislature. In the months of the 2023 legislative session, he was able to pass universal free school meals, legalize the use of recreational marijuana, and create a state program for paid family and medical leave.",
      "\"I'm confident that a DFLer will hold this seat come November. I'm confident that I will find ways to contribute to the state I love even after I've left office next January. But there will be time to worry about all that later,\" he said.",
      "A source close to Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar says she is considering running for governor, but has not made a decision.",

      "Alvin Hellerstein was 64 years old when former President Bill Clinton appointed him to the federal bench. That was more than a quarter century ago. Now, the 92-year-old senior judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York adds former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to his roster of prominent, famed and infamous defendants \u2014 but he's not the first former head of state to come before Hellerstein's court.",
      "Hellerstein has repeatedly rejected efforts by President Trump to remove his New York State criminal case to federal court, penning withering criticisms of Mr. Trump's arguments that the facts at the heart of his \"hush money\" case warranted official acts conducted during his first presidency. Mr. Trump was found guilty by a state jury in that case, which revolved around reimbursements made to a former Trump attorney, Michael Cohen, for a payment just before the 2016 presidential election to adult film star Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels.",
      "\"Reimbursing Cohen for advancing hush money to Stephanie Clifford cannot be considered the performance of a constitutional duty,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Falsifying business records to hide such reimbursement, and to transform the reimbursement into a business expense for Trump and income to Cohen, likewise does not relate to a presidential duty.\"",
      "But a 2024 ruling by the Supreme Court has forced Hellerstein to reconsider that determination. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered Hellerstein to reexamine arguments around presidential immunity, factoring the Supreme Court's landmark decision that upended multiple Trump cases.",
      "Hellerstein was also the judge assigned to preside over an American Civil Liberties Union effort that challenged the deportation of two Venezuelans last year. Hellerstein granted a temporary restraining order protecting deportees in the Southern District of New York from being removed prior to receiving due process. The case was filed on behalf of two Venezuelans challenging the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members.",
      "The no-nonsense judge also recently presided over the 2025 trial of Charlie Javice, who was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase out of $175 million by lying about the size of her company's customer base. That company, Frank, claimed to revolutionize the way college students applied for financial aid.",
      "Hellerstein has presided over matters tied to the Maduro case since 2014 when he was assigned to a related case. He oversaw a superseding indictment naming Maduro in 2020. Monday's hearing was, of course, the first time the lead defendant has appeared in Hellerstein's court.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers return to Washington this week, staring down an end-of-month deadline to avert another government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers return to Washington this week, staring down an end-of-month deadline to avert another government shutdown. The next funding fight comes fresh off a revolt from moderate Republicans over rising health care costs, and as the conflict with Venezuela and frustration with the Justice Department's handling of the rollout of the Epstein files come to a head.",
      "Funding the government is at the top of Congress' to-do list after a bruising 43-day shutdown that stretched from October through the first half of November. To end the longest shutdown in history, lawmakers approved a measure to fund parts of the government through the end of the fiscal year in September. Funding for the vast majority of agencies and programs, however, was temporarily extended until Jan. 30.",
      "Congress risks a partial shutdown if it does not approve new funding or another short-term patch for the remaining portions of the government before the end of the month. And it has to balance that priority alongside other legislative battles.",
      "Funding the government",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top GOP appropriators in the Senate and House, announced an agreement on top-line spending for the remaining nine funding bills just before Christmas.",
      "\"This pathway forward aligns with President Trump's clear direction to rein in runaway, beltway-driven spending,\" Cole said in a statement, noting that the total funding falls below the current levels. \"We will now begin expeditiously drafting the remaining nine full-year bills to ensure we are ready to complete our work in January.\"",
      "House and Senate negotiators released the text of an initial package of three bills on Monday, known as a \"minibus.\" The legislation would provide funding related to science and the Departments of Commerce and Justice; energy and water development; and the Department of Interior and the EPA.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that \"passing these bills will help ensure that Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent-by once again providing hundreds of detailed spending directives and reasserting congressional control over these incredibly important spending decisions.\"",
      "The progress inches Congress one step closer to avoiding a shutdown, though potential roadblocks remain. Buy-in from Democrats is necessary in the Senate for passage and may be needed in the House if conservatives withhold their support \u2014 a move they regularly threaten with funding bills.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, is also facing a dwindling majority. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is vacating her seat on Monday, retiring a year before her term ends after a bitter feud with President Trump. Her departure will leave Johnson with a two-vote margin.",
      "After weeks of debate among Senate Republicans, the upper chamber had hoped to move forward with another \"minibus\" ahead of the winter recess, but two Democratic senators stood in the way.",
      "Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado held up the package to object to the Trump administration's dismantling of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which is located in Boulder. The senators pledged to use \"every lever available to do what is right for Colorado.\" The duo may be even less inclined to allow the funding bills to move forward after Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill designed to make it easier to build a water pipeline in Colorado.",
      "Should the process to pass the long-term measures stall, leaders could opt to pursue another short-term continuing resolution and again punt the funding issue down the line.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday that Congress isn't headed toward a shutdown at the end of the month. He said Democrats want to work on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to fund the government through September, and \"the good news is our Republican appropriators are working with us and we're making good progress in that regard.\"",
      "Health care",
      "Democrats' demand to extend the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits was at the center of last year's shutdown. Their effort to extend the tax credits as part of the agreement to reopen the government fell short and the subsidies expired last week, raising premiums for millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the exchanges.",
      "But the fight isn't over yet.",
      "After a vote on a Democratic measure to extend the tax credits for three years without reforms fell short in the Senate, four moderate House Republicans joined all Democrats to back a discharge petition to force a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "The moderates had criticized a straight extension without any reforms such as income caps, but argued that Democrats' proposal to extend the tax credits without any changes was better than allowing them to expire.",
      "The House is expected to vote on the motion to discharge the bill for a vote in the coming days. Johnson said it was \"inevitable\" that it would be considered on the floor when lawmakers returned after the holidays.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that \"we've got to make sure that a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits passes out of the House upon our return next week so we can protect the health care of tens of millions of Americans who are about to experience dramatically increased health insurance premiums, copays and deductibles.\"",
      "\"That's completely and totally unacceptable, and Republicans have a responsibility to partner with us as Democrats to stop it,\" Jeffries added.",
      "Ahead of the winter break, the discharge petition seemed to add momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise. A number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have been seeking a solution on health care costs, and were expected to continue their conversations over the holidays. The discharge petition could serve as a vehicle for an extension of the tax credits with some reforms, should the lawmakers reach a compromise.",
      "Lawmakers to apply pressure on Epstein files release",
      "Congress' return is also expected to be marked by new pressure on the Justice Department over its piecemeal approach to releasing the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act \u2014 which Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law in November \u2014 dictated that the Justice Department release the files by Dec. 19. However, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department will release them on a rolling basis due to the volume of materials and the need to redact some information.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, spearheaded the legislation and the effort to force a vote on the issue. They have both criticized the Justice Department's handling of the release.",
      "So far, the Justice Department has released thousands of documents that are believed to represent only a small fraction of the Epstein files. The first release came on Dec. 19, followed by the release of additional materials a day later, along with a massive tranche of files on Dec. 23. The Justice Department also said on Dec. 24 that \"over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case\" had been uncovered, adding that the process of releasing the files may take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "Khanna and Massie said last month that they are drafting a resolution to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress over the release of the files. The lawmakers said they were building support for the resolution, which would likely be offered as a privileged motion, requiring leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Schumer also announced last month that he had introduced a resolution that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes this week.",
      "A group of senators, including one Republican, has also requested that the Justice Department's inspector general conduct an audit of the department's compliance with the new law. The senators said the investigation is \"essential\" given the Trump administration's \"historic hostility to releasing the files\" and \"politicization of the Epstein case more broadly.\"",
      "Conflict with Venezuela",
      "Another war powers vote is also on the horizon after Mr. Trump announced early Saturday that the U.S. had carried out a \"large scale strike against Venezuela\" and captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife. Mr. Trump also said the U.S. will \"run the country\" and threatened a \"much larger attack\" if needed. The development marks a major escalation in the monthslong military campaign against the South American nation.",
      "Congress has not authorized military force against Venezuela, and the Trump administration did not notify lawmakers of the plan ahead of time.",
      "Most Democrats and a few Republicans have sought to limit Mr. Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-trafficking boats in the region as the U.S. leader says the South American country's role in drug smuggling poses a threat to national security. But the Senate and House have each failed twice to limit Mr. Trump's authority to continue the military campaign.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the Senate will vote this week on his latest war powers resolution. He introduced the measure in early December, days after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "In a call with reporters on Saturday he called the military action in Venezuela \"an illegal war.\"",
      "\"There is no legal justification in the Constitution, in the history of the Constitution, or an American law that would authorize the president to wage war, to depose President Maduro and seize its oil and run the country of Venezuela without coming to Congress,\" Kaine said. \"It's time for Congress to get its ass off the couch and do what the Constitution mandates that we do.\"",
      "Besides the war powers resolution, Kaine said he's also looking at the defense appropriations process as a mechanism to prohibit military action in Venezuela.",
      "Before they left for the year, House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump warned that land strikes against Venezuela could commence \"soon.\" Since then, the U.S. carried out several more boat strikes and, according to Mr. Trump, \"knocked out\" a \"big facility\" linked to the alleged drug smuggling operations.",

    "story": [
      "A team of researchers discovered a new type of astronomical object that may help experts learn more about the formation of galaxies and the development of the early universe.",
      "NASA dubbed the object \"Cloud-9\" and described it as a \"starless, gas-rich dark-matter\" hydrogen cloud and remnant of the universe's early formation about 14 million light-years from Earth. Scientists have theorized about such an object, but this is the first time one has been confirmed to exist, NASA said. These types of clouds are believed to be dark matter clouds that couldn't accumulate enough gas to form stars, NASA said.",
      "Cloud 9 was identified three years ago, but it wasn't until recently that the Hubble Space Telescope could be used to confirm there were no stars inside. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an assistant professor at Italy's Milano-Bicocca University and the principal investigator on the Hubble team, said that Cloud-9 tells the \"tale of a failed galaxy.\"",
      "\"In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes,\" Benitez-Llambay said. \"In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.\"",
      "The core of Cloud-9 is made up of neutral hydrogen. It is about 4,900 light-years in diameter, NASA said. The hydrogen is estimated to measure one million times the mass of the sun.",
      "Cloud-9 also includes a huge amount of dark matter -- about five billion solar masses worth, NASA said. Andrew Fox, a member of the team who studied the object, called it a \"window into the dark universe.\"",
      "\"We know from theory that most of the mass in the universe is expected to be dark matter, but it's difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn't emit light,\" said Fox. \"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.\"",
      "NASA said the cloud also \"suggests the existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated structures in the universe.\" Those kind of objects can be hard to study, because nearby bright features like stars and galaxies outshine them. Researchers also typically focus their attention on those brighter structures, NASA said. Because those items are hard to study, the findings from Cloud-9 help provide new insights, NASA said.",
      "Cloud-9 is the ninth gas cloud identified on the outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 94, NASA said. Cloud-9 is smaller, more compact and highly spherical compared to those other clouds. It also appears to have a \"physical association\" with Messier 94, NASA said.",
      "Astronomers will conduct further surveys into Cloud-9 to learn more about dark matter, failed galaxies and the early universe itself, NASA said. They will also search for other similar objects.",
      "\"Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,\" said researcher Rachael Beaton, of the Space Telescope Science Institute.",
      "Cloud-9 may continue to change and could even grow into a galaxy if it continues to expand, NASA said.",

      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",

Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming.

      "Amazon customers can now file a claim under its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which resolved allegations of deceptive enrollment practices in the retailer's Prime shopping service.",
      "As part of the September 2025 settlement, Amazon is offering $1.5 billion in refunds to eligible customers, as well as paying a $1 billion civil penalty. The FTC had alleged that Amazon duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it hard for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations as part of the settlement. Here's what to know.",
      "How do you file a claim in the Amazon Prime FTC settlement?",
      "Amazon customers should go to the settlement website to file their claim. Although millions of eligible customers will receive automatic payments through the settlement without filing a claim, some will need to submit one, the site notes.",
      "Customers eligible for automatic payments are those who signed up for Prime through what the FTC calls a \"challenged enrollment flow,\" including pages such as Amazon's shipping selection page and its single-page checkout. Consumers who used three or fewer Prime benefits within a 12-month period are also due for refunds without submitting a claim.",
      "Prime benefits include services such as free two-day shipping, Prime Video streaming and Amazon Music.",
      "If you signed up for Prime through a \"challenged enrollment flow\" between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, and you used Prime benefits between three and 10 times in a 12-month period, you may need to file a claim to get money under the settlement.",
      "Eligible customers who need to file a claim will receive an email or a mailed notice, according to the settlement website.",
      "How much money will Amazon customers receive?",
      "People who qualify can receive a refund of their Amazon Prime membership fees, up to $51, according to the settlement site.",
      "However, some customers may see smaller amounts if, for instance, they signed up for a trial membership that charged less than the regular Prime fee, the site notes.",
      "When will you get the Amazon Prime refund?",
      "Customers will be contacted by email or mail (postmarked by January 23) to inform them if they are eligible, according to the settlement site.",
      "Consumers will then have 180 days to submit a claim, and Amazon will review each claim within 30 days of receiving it. Payments should \"follow shortly after approval of your claims form,\" the site adds.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration plans to halt billions of dollars in federal funding for social services programs in five states led by Democrats following allegations of fraud, a Department of Health and Human Services official said Tuesday.",
      "The move will freeze $7 billion for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, nearly $2.4 billion for the Child Care Development Fund and roughly $870 million for social services grants that largely benefit children. The states affected are Minnesota, New York, California, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "The New York Post was first to report that HHS would withhold the funding.",
      "\"For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,\" Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement. \"Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes. We will ensure these states are following the law and protecting hard-earned taxpayer money.\"",
      "The Illinois Department of Human Services said it has not yet received any notification or communication about impacts to its federal funding.",
      "\"This is yet another politically-motivated action by the Trump Administration that confuses families and leaves states with more questions than answers. IDHS will provide an update if it is made aware of program or funding changes,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The decision by the Trump administration comes after HHS announced last week that it froze federal child care funding for Minnesota because of \"blatant fraud\" in public-assistance programs.",
      "More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of fraud schemes that have been uncovered in Minnesota since 2021. Prosecutors estimate the the total amount of fraud could reach $9 billion. The scandal started with a $250 million COVID-era scheme involving a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, which was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program.",
      "Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered \"large-scale fraud\" in a housing program for seniors and people with disabilities, and a program that provides services to children with autism. The Trump administration is also probing claims of fraud by day care centers in Minnesota, which gained national attention after a conservative YouTube personality named Nick Shirley posted a video that showed him visiting federally backed child care centers around Minneapolis and finding no children there.",
      "CBS News visited several of the centers named by Shirley and found that all but two of the facilities have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months.",
      "President Trump has criticized Minnesota leaders for its handling of the scandal and attacked Somali immigrants, claiming they have \"ripped off\" the state. Many, but not all, of the defendants charged in the fraud schemes are of Somali descent.",
      "Mr. Trump has attacked California, led by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, as \"more corrupt\" than Minnesota. He said Tuesday in a Truth Social post that \"the fraud investigation of California has begun.\" The president has not provided evidence of wide-scale fraud in California social services and did not provide further details about a probe involving the state.",
      "Beyond Minnesota, the Trump administration has also not put forth evidence of sweeping fraud schemes in social services in New York, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "Still, over the past several months the Trump administration has turned off the spigot of funding to Democrat-led states and cities, particularly during the historic government shutdown last year. Mr. Trump paused billions of dollars for infrastructure and climate projects, and slashed disaster preparedness grants.",
      "Democrats have accused the administration of playing politics with money that has been approved by Congress.",

    "story": [
      "The average price of gas around the U.S. this year is expected to dip to $2.97 per gallon, down 13 cents from 2025 \u2014 that would be the lowest level since 2020, according to a new analysis by GasBuddy.",
      "At the end of 2025, average U.S. prices at the pump\u00a0dipped below $3, with GasBuddy citing strong refinery output, lower oil prices, robust crude production and softer seasonal demand as the main reasons behind the decline.",
      "\"It's not a return to ultra-cheap fuel, but for the first time in a long time, the wind is clearly behind drivers' backs,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said in a statement.",
      "Expect a rise, then a dip",
      "While prices are expected to average below $3 in 2026, GasBuddy says drivers should expect some volatility throughout the year due to seasonal demand, weather and geopolitical risks.",
      "The company, whose app helps drivers save money on fuel, predicts gas prices will edge up to around $3.20 between spring and early summer before falling to an average of $2.83 after June.",
      "That would mirror normal seasonal fluctuations. Gas prices tend to rise in the spring and fall in the winter, when fuel demand typically weakens.",
      "What will prices be in my state?",
      "To be sure, the price you see at the pump depends on where you live. For example, prices on the Gulf Coast and South are expected to stay well under $3 for the year, while prices in California, the Northeast and cities like Chicago could be higher, according to GasBuddy.",

    "story": [
      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving Venezuela's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon are planning to meet with Trump administration officials later this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "Shares of the three companies\u00a0rose on Wall Street Monday, a sign investors see upside for Big Oil following the developments in Venezuela.",
      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said. For example, U.S. refineries like Texas-based Valero could gain access to a huge, geographically proximate source of the heavy crude they require to produce different fuels.",

    "story": [
      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area, officials tells CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal\u00a0in Minnesota, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations, the agency's investigative arm tasked with fighting transnational crimes, the officials said. They requested anonymity to discuss operations that have not been publicly announced.",
      "The plan is for the agents and officers to oversee a 30-day surge in operations in the Twin Cities area, making the region the first major target of the Trump administration's expanded immigration crackdown in the new year, officials said. Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to probe alleged cases of fraud, building on last month's inspection of dozens of sites in the Minneapolis area.",
      "Officials said U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, who has overseen controversial immigration roundups in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans, is expected to arrive in Minnesota to help lead immigration enforcement efforts, along with an unknown number of U.S. Border Patrol personnel.",
      "The deployment, which began Sunday, represents one of the largest concentrations of DHS personnel in an American city in recent years. The move greatly expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota at a time of heightened political and community tension there.",
      "According to senior law enforcement officials, the surge includes several hundred additional agents from Homeland Security Investigations, as well as hundreds of officers from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations. Tactical units known as Special Response Teams are also slated to be part of the operation, along with a layered command structure of dozens of high-ranking supervisors.",
      "One former law enforcement official described the scale as extraordinary, noting that the number of HSI agents being sent to Minneapolis is roughly equivalent to the entire HSI workforce assigned to the state of Arizona. \"This is a massive resource allocation,\" the official said, adding that Minneapolis is effectively becoming \"the new Chicago,\" referencing past large-scale federal enforcement deployments in Illinois.",
      "Multiple officials told CBS News the total federal presence could ultimately become even larger, with as many as 600 HSI agents and up to 1,500 ICE ERO officers rotating through the Minneapolis area over the course of the month-long deployment.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
      "Late last year, ICE launched an immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, targeting immigrants who had been issued deportation orders, including those from Somalia. As of Dec. 19, ICE had carried out nearly 700 arrests as part of the operation, according to DHS.",
      "The new surge comes amid intense state and federal scrutiny of Minnesota following years of high-profile fraud cases involving federally funded programs. They have included some of the largest pandemic-era and post-pandemic fraud schemes in the country, like the Feeding Our Future case, which led to dozens of indictments and convictions.",
      "Federal prosecutors have charged more than 90 people in Minnesota-based fraud cases since 2021, with more than 60 convictions so far, according to court records. Investigators have revealed the alleged schemes span multiple federal programs, including nutrition, housing stabilization and child care assistance, with potential losses estimated in the billions of dollars.",
      "In recent weeks, federal activity across the Minneapolis area has increased, with HSI agents canvassing businesses and ICE officers conducting arrests in and around immigrant-populated neighborhoods. That uptick in law enforcement activity has prompted protests, confrontations and widespread fear among immigrant communities \u2014 particularly within Minnesota's large Somali-American population.",
      "President Trump has regularly cited Somalia \u2014 often in incendiary terms \u2014 to justify his mass deportation campaign. Last month, Mr. Trump called people from Somalia \"garbage\" and said they \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" the president said. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"",
      "At the same time, Minnesota officials led by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz have pushed back on claims that the state failed to act, pointing to audits, third-party reviews, the appointment of a program-integrity director and the creation of a statewide fraud-prevention council.",
      "But Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection to a third term as criticism has boiled over.",
      "Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News that the governor met with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sunday, as the fellow Democrat considers whether or not to enter the race.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services has frozen $185 million in federal child care payments to Minnesota, citing ongoing fraud concerns. The governor and other state leaders have warned that the move, along with a heightened federal law enforcement presence, risks harming legitimate businesses and families who rely on public assistance programs.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 20:18:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The new CDC recommendations suggest reducing the number of vaccinations all children should receive.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention on Monday announced updated recommendations for childhood vaccines with some significant changes. The new guidelines recommend fewer shots and are likely to face pushback from many doctors and public health experts.",
      "Under the new guidelines, the CDC recommends all children be vaccinated against 11 diseases, a decrease from the 17 immunizations previously recommended.",
      "The vaccines recommended under the new guidelines include diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), as well as varicella (chickenpox). (Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.)",
      "In a second category under the new guidelines, it's recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B.",
      "Finally, in a third category, for children not in high-risk groups, the decision on whether to receive certain vaccines should be based on \"shared clinical decision-making\" between physicians and parents, according to the CDC. Those immunizations include COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B.",
      "\"It's very complicated to try to figure out the risks and the benefits,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said on the \"CBS Evening News.\" \"It's so important to have a health care provider with whom you can discuss this openly and empathetically.\"",
      "He noted, \"The American Academy of Pediatrics calls today's recommendations dangerous and said they're going to continue to give their own recommendations.\"",
      "The changes follow a controversial December recommendation on when children should receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been hand-picked by Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, said in a statement that Monday's announcement \"protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.\"",
      "\"After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,\" he said.",
      "President Trump called the updates \"a far more reasonable schedule, where all children will only be recommended to receive vaccinations for 11 of the most serious and dangerous diseases.\" But parents could still choose to give their children other vaccinations and those will still be covered by insurance, Mr. Trump said.",
      "The assessment compared the U.S. vaccine schedule to those of 20 other developed nations and found that the U.S. is a \"global outlier\" in both the number of diseases addressed and total number of recommended doses, according to the Health and Human Services Department.",
      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0has disputed that, saying the longstanding U.S. recommendations were based on \"robust evidence\" and are \"largely similar across developed countries,\" with some variance due to factors like disease threats, demographics and health care systems.",
      "Dr. Ronald G. Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called Monday's announcement a \"reckless step.\"",
      "\"Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face,\" he said in a statement. The biggest\u00a0measles outbreak\u00a0in more than 30 years has sickened more than 2,000 people across the U.S. Most of those sickened were not vaccinated, and two children died.",
      "Dr. Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota, warned that the change in the CDC's vaccine recommendations will put children at risk.",
      "\"Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\" Osterholm told The Associated Press.",

      "Shares in other U.S. energy sector players also rose, with oil services giants Halliburton and Schlumberger both adding more than 10%. The price of U.S. crude rose 1.4% to $58.13 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, climbed 1.2% to $61.50.",
      "Oil industry players drifted up amid a broader surge in stocks on Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 549 points, or 1.2%, to close at an all-time high of 48,977. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.",
      "After Maduro's capture, President Trump said U.S. oil companies would participate in rebuilding Venezuela's decaying energy infrastructure.",
      "Venezuela's oil sector produces 750 million to 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data. The U.S., the world's largest oil producer, produces 13.5 million barrels per day, while No. 2 Saudi Arabia pumps an estimated 10 million barrels.",
      "Yet while Venezuela's oil production has plunged in recent decades due to government mismanagement, underinvestment and the impact of U.S. sanctions, the country is sitting on proven reserves of more than 300 billion barrels \u2014 the world's largest oil patch.",
      "While experts think that significantly boosting oil production in Venezuela could cost upwards of $100 billion and take at least a decade, some Wall Street analysts foresee a potentially faster upgrade.",
      "\"Venezuela could realistically achieve production levels of 1.3\u20131.4 [million barrels per day] within two years of a political transition,\" analysts with J.P. Morgan Markets said in a report.",
      "\"U.S. companies that may become involved in Venezuela are primarily major oil firms like Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. Chevron already has a presence in the country, while others are exploring opportunities to recover previously expropriated assets and invest in Venezuela's massive heavy crude reserves,\" J.P. Morgan added. \"There may also be interest from U.S Gulf Coast refiners seeking less costly sources of heavy oil.\"",

      "Despite Venezuela's ample oil reserves, David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at investment adviser Capital Economics, said the business case for investing in the country's weakened energy sector is questionable, pointing to the high projected costs of extracting its \"heavy\" oil reserves.",

She also appeared in court on Monday with a bandage on her forehead. It's unclear if the former Venezuelan president was injured, but his attorney,\u00a0Barry Pollack, told the court he has health issues that will require attention. Hellerstein promised them both full medical attention.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Monday that he won't seek reelection, a surprise exit from politics less than 18 months after the Democrat was chosen to be the party's nominee for vice president.",
      "Walz was seeking an unprecedented third straight term as Minnesota's governor. But the 180 came amid intense scrutiny over fraud schemes in the North Star State, which has seen a resurgence in recent weeks.",
      "While Walz is not implicated in the fraud issues, the reality that the schemes have become an urgent problem under his watch has enveloped talk of the Minnesotan governor's future political ambitions.",
      "From VP pick to ending his reelection bid",
      "Walz, a former high school social studies teacher, coach and congressman who served in the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guards, vaulted into the national political scene during the summer of 2024 as Democratic President Joe Biden faced questions about whether he should stay in the presidential race following a disastrous debate performance.",
      "After Biden dropped out of the race and former Vice President Kamala Harris was tapped to lead the ticket, Harris turned to Walz as her pick for vice president, opting for the former football coach from a blue state over contenders from more traditional presidential battlegrounds.",
      "Democrats rallied around Harris and Walz, and the Minnesota governor's stripped-back, folksy style \u2014 like describing Republican candidates as \"weird\" \u2014 seemed to add to the ticket's appeal. But a lackluster performance during that fall's vice presidential debate did little to help the party avoid stinging losses in November 2024.",
      "In the wake of that loss, Walz held nationally-focused town halls in several states while also being seen as a potential candidate for the 2028 presidential election. Last year, he announced he would run for a third term as governor.",
      "An uproar over Minnesota fraud",
      "Walz's name came back into the national spotlight in recent months, amid uproar over a series of multimillion-dollar pandemic fraud schemes in Minnesota. Though Walz isn't implicated in the scheme, he's served as the state's governor since 2019, and his administration has faced years of local scrutiny over their handling of fraud.",
      "During the Biden administration in 2022, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States,\" which revolved around a welfare program that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children. Republican officials have argued for years that Minnesota was slow to act in the scheme, and failed to carry out due diligence. But the issue saw a resurgence late last year.",
      "The criticism over Minnesota fraud rose to the top GOP ranks, and President Trump directed his ire over the issue at Walz, including with a post on Truth Social on Thanksgiving where he used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to describe the Minnesota governor. And the Treasury Department said last month that it would investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia. Meanwhile, House Republicans on the Oversight Committee launched an investigation into Walz's handling of the fraud cases.",
      "Walz: \"I can't give a political campaign my all\"",
      "Scrutiny over the fraud scandal hasn't died down in recent weeks. And in his statement announcing an end to his gubernatorial bid, Walz cited the scheme.",
      "Walz acknowledged that in recent years, \"an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state's generosity,\" adding that \"even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.\"",
      "\"I won't mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies \u2013 in Washington, in St. Paul, and online \u2013 want to make our state a colder, meaner place,\" Walz said. \"They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.\"",
      "Walz outlined his administration's effort to combat fraud, saying \"across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem.\" But he said there's \"more to do,\" and \"the buck stops with me.\"",
      "The second-term governor said while he announced a reelection bid in September, he's come to the conclusion in recent weeks that \"I can't give a political campaign my all,\" specifically citing the fraud scandal.",
      "\"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,\" Walz said. \"So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.\"",
      "In a statement on Walz's decision, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the No. 3 House Republican, simply said, \"Good riddance.\"",

    "summary": "CBS News is tracking a record number of measles cases around the country after an outbreak in West Texas that led to the deaths of two children.",
    "story": [
      "In 2025, United States recorded the most measles cases in more than 30 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. A large share of the infections were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The total number of cases nationwide topped 2.000 by the end of the year, with infections confirmed in at least 44 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, with over\u00a0760\u00a0confirmed infections before the state declared the outbreak\u00a0officially over\u00a0in August. A growing number of cases have also been reported in other states around the country. In South Carolina, for example,\u00a0dozens of students were quarantined in October due to an outbreak.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Wednesdays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak primarily affected\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or had an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history\u00a0of making\u00a0false and misleading claims\u00a0about vaccines, voiced support for vaccination as the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0spread in the Southwest.",
      "\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook in an interview\u00a0in April, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.",
      "Asked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" but added, \"The government should not be mandating those.\"",

    "story": [
      "Alvin Hellerstein was 64 years old when former President Bill Clinton appointed him to the federal bench. That was more than a quarter century ago. Now, the 92-year-old senior judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York adds former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to his roster of prominent, famed and infamous defendants \u2014 but he's not the first former head of state to come before Hellerstein's court.",
      "Hellerstein has repeatedly rejected efforts by President Trump to remove his New York State criminal case to federal court, penning withering criticisms of Mr. Trump's arguments that the facts at the heart of his \"hush money\" case warranted official acts conducted during his first presidency. Mr. Trump was found guilty by a state jury in that case, which revolved around reimbursements made to a former Trump attorney, Michael Cohen, for a payment just before the 2016 presidential election to adult film star Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels.",
      "\"Reimbursing Cohen for advancing hush money to Stephanie Clifford cannot be considered the performance of a constitutional duty,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Falsifying business records to hide such reimbursement, and to transform the reimbursement into a business expense for Trump and income to Cohen, likewise does not relate to a presidential duty.\"",
      "But a 2024 ruling by the Supreme Court has forced Hellerstein to reconsider that determination. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered Hellerstein to reexamine arguments around presidential immunity, factoring the Supreme Court's landmark decision that upended multiple Trump cases.",
      "Hellerstein was also the judge assigned to preside over an American Civil Liberties Union effort that challenged the deportation of two Venezuelans last year. Hellerstein granted a temporary restraining order protecting deportees in the Southern District of New York from being removed prior to receiving due process. The case was filed on behalf of two Venezuelans challenging the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members.",
      "The no-nonsense judge also recently presided over the 2025 trial of Charlie Javice, who was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase out of $175 million by lying about the size of her company's customer base. That company, Frank, claimed to revolutionize the way college students applied for financial aid.",
      "Hellerstein has presided over matters tied to the Maduro case since 2014 when he was assigned to a related case. He oversaw a superseding indictment naming Maduro in 2020. Monday's hearing was, of course, the first time the lead defendant has appeared in Hellerstein's court.",

      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers return to Washington this week, staring down an end-of-month deadline to avert another government shutdown. The next funding fight comes fresh off a revolt from moderate Republicans over rising health care costs, and as the conflict with Venezuela and frustration with the Justice Department's handling of the rollout of the Epstein files come to a head.",
      "Funding the government is at the top of Congress' to-do list after a bruising 43-day shutdown that stretched from October through the first half of November. To end the longest shutdown in history, lawmakers approved a measure to fund parts of the government through the end of the fiscal year in September. Funding for the vast majority of agencies and programs, however, was temporarily extended until Jan. 30.",
      "Congress risks a partial shutdown if it does not approve new funding or another short-term patch for the remaining portions of the government before the end of the month. And it has to balance that priority alongside other legislative battles.",
      "Funding the government",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top GOP appropriators in the Senate and House, announced an agreement on top-line spending for the remaining nine funding bills just before Christmas.",
      "\"This pathway forward aligns with President Trump's clear direction to rein in runaway, beltway-driven spending,\" Cole said in a statement, noting that the total funding falls below the current levels. \"We will now begin expeditiously drafting the remaining nine full-year bills to ensure we are ready to complete our work in January.\"",
      "House and Senate negotiators released the text of an initial package of three bills on Monday, known as a \"minibus.\" The legislation would provide funding related to science and the Departments of Commerce and Justice; energy and water development; and the Department of Interior and the EPA.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that \"passing these bills will help ensure that Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent-by once again providing hundreds of detailed spending directives and reasserting congressional control over these incredibly important spending decisions.\"",
      "The progress inches Congress one step closer to avoiding a shutdown, though potential roadblocks remain. Buy-in from Democrats is necessary in the Senate for passage and may be needed in the House if conservatives withhold their support \u2014 a move they regularly threaten with funding bills.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is vacating her seat on Monday, retiring a year before her term ends after a bitter feud with President Trump. Her departure will leave Johnson with a two-vote margin.",
      "After weeks of debate among Senate Republicans, the upper chamber had hoped to move forward with another \"minibus\" ahead of the winter recess, but two Democratic senators stood in the way.",
      "Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado held up the package to object to the Trump administration's dismantling of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which is located in Boulder. The senators pledged to use \"every lever available to do what is right for Colorado.\" The duo may be even less inclined to allow the funding bills to move forward after Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill designed to make it easier to build a water pipeline in Colorado.",
      "Should the process to pass the long-term measures stall, leaders could opt to pursue another short-term continuing resolution and again punt the funding issue down the line.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday that Congress isn't headed toward a shutdown at the end of the month. He said Democrats want to work on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to fund the government through September, and \"the good news is our Republican appropriators are working with us and we're making good progress in that regard.\"",
      "Health care",
      "Democrats' demand to extend the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits was at the center of last year's shutdown. Their effort to extend the tax credits as part of the agreement to reopen the government fell short and the subsidies expired last week, raising premiums for millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the exchanges.",
      "But the fight isn't over yet.",
      "After a vote on a Democratic measure to extend the tax credits for three years without reforms fell short in the Senate, four moderate House Republicans joined all Democrats to back a discharge petition to force a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "The moderates had criticized a straight extension without any reforms such as income caps, but argued that Democrats' proposal to extend the tax credits without any changes was better than allowing them to expire.",
      "The House is expected to vote on the motion to discharge the bill for a vote in the coming days. Johnson said it was \"inevitable\" that it would be considered on the floor when lawmakers returned after the holidays.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that \"we've got to make sure that a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits passes out of the House upon our return next week so we can protect the health care of tens of millions of Americans who are about to experience dramatically increased health insurance premiums, copays and deductibles.\"",
      "\"That's completely and totally unacceptable, and Republicans have a responsibility to partner with us as Democrats to stop it,\" Jeffries added.",
      "Ahead of the winter break, the discharge petition seemed to add momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise. A number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have been seeking a solution on health care costs, and were expected to continue their conversations over the holidays. The discharge petition could serve as a vehicle for an extension of the tax credits with some reforms, should the lawmakers reach a compromise.",
      "Lawmakers to apply pressure on Epstein files release",
      "Congress' return is also expected to be marked by new pressure on the Justice Department over its piecemeal approach to releasing the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act \u2014 which Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law in November \u2014 dictated that the Justice Department release the files by Dec. 19. However, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department will release them on a rolling basis due to the volume of materials and the need to redact some information.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, spearheaded the legislation and the effort to force a vote on the issue. They have both criticized the Justice Department's handling of the release.",
      "So far, the Justice Department has released thousands of documents that are believed to represent only a small fraction of the Epstein files. The first release came on Dec. 19, followed by the release of additional materials a day later, along with a massive tranche of files on Dec. 23. The Justice Department also said on Dec. 24 that \"over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case\" had been uncovered, adding that the process of releasing the files may take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "Khanna and Massie said last month that they are drafting a resolution to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress over the release of the files. The lawmakers said they were building support for the resolution, which would likely be offered as a privileged motion, requiring leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Schumer also announced last month that he had introduced a resolution that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes this week.",
      "A group of senators, including one Republican, has also requested that the Justice Department's inspector general conduct an audit of the department's compliance with the new law. The senators said the investigation is \"essential\" given the Trump administration's \"historic hostility to releasing the files\" and \"politicization of the Epstein case more broadly.\"",
      "Conflict with Venezuela",
      "Another war powers vote is also on the horizon after Mr. Trump announced early Saturday that the U.S. had carried out a \"large scale strike against Venezuela\" and captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife. Mr. Trump also said the U.S. will \"run the country\" and threatened a \"much larger attack\" if needed. The development marks a major escalation in the monthslong military campaign against the South American nation.",
      "Congress has not authorized military force against Venezuela, and the Trump administration did not notify lawmakers of the plan ahead of time.",
      "Most Democrats and a few Republicans have sought to limit Mr. Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-trafficking boats in the region as the U.S. leader says the South American country's role in drug smuggling poses a threat to national security. But the Senate and House have each failed twice to limit Mr. Trump's authority to continue the military campaign.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the Senate will vote this week on his latest war powers resolution. He introduced the measure in early December, days after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "In a call with reporters on Saturday he called the military action in Venezuela \"an illegal war.\"",
      "\"There is no legal justification in the Constitution, in the history of the Constitution, or an American law that would authorize the president to wage war, to depose President Maduro and seize its oil and run the country of Venezuela without coming to Congress,\" Kaine said. \"It's time for Congress to get its ass off the couch and do what the Constitution mandates that we do.\"",
      "Besides the war powers resolution, Kaine said he's also looking at the defense appropriations process as a mechanism to prohibit military action in Venezuela.",
      "Before they left for the year, House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump warned that land strikes against Venezuela could commence \"soon.\" Since then, the U.S. carried out several more boat strikes and, according to Mr. Trump, \"knocked out\" a \"big facility\" linked to the alleged drug smuggling operations.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump isn't denying the possibility of further American expansion, intervention or annexation efforts in the Western Hemisphere after the military's success in plucking former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from Caracas over the weekend to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S.",
      "In the past, he's threatened to annex Greenland and Canada and predicted the governments in Cuba and Colombia would fall. Now, Mr. Trump is making similar comments again and raising new questions about what he plans to do next.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that under his administration, \"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again\" \u2014 dubbing his approach the \"Don-roe Doctrine,\" a spin on the 19th century foreign policy concept.",
      "It's not clear whether the president will act on his threats against other countries.",
      "Here's the latest on countries and territories that have been the subject of interventionist comments by the president:",
      "Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump has long coveted Greenland and has said it's necessary for U.S. national security, a point he made again Sunday.",
      "\"We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" he said. \"We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security.\"",
      "\"Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"To boost up security in Greenland, they added one more dogsled.\"",
      "The president also named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as special envoy to Greenland last month to represent U.S. interests on the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Landry said in a social media post addressed to Mr. Trump, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"",
      "In March, Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland and told a reporter while he was there that \"what we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself.",
      "A post on Saturday by Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, showed Greenland covered in an American flag accompanied by the comment \"Soon,\" which prompted some to wonder if its annexation is on the horizon.",
      "Asked by CNN on Monday if he could rule out that the U.S. is going to try to take Greenland by force, Stephen Miller said, \"There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking \u2014 of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One over the weekend that while nothing is imminent, \"we'll worry about Greenland in about two months. Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen chided Mr. Trump in a social media post, calling suggestions of annexation \"fantasies\" and writing: \"That's enough now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, the leaders of Europe issued a statement saying \"security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.\"",
      "Iran",
      "Escalating protests over the desperate economic conditions in Iran have been taking place for over a week, and there have been reports that dozens of people have been killed. In response, hours before the Venezuela operation began, Mr. Trump posted on social media that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\" He said the U.S. is \"locked and loaded.\"",
      "The president said Sunday of the demonstrations in Iran, \"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.\"",
      "In June, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Iran's major nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, in an effort to destroy its nuclear enrichment capacity.",
      "Cuba",
      "On the way back to Washington Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"Cuba looks like it's ready to fall,\" adding that he didn't know \"if they're going to hold out.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks Saturday indicated Cuba's leaders should be worried: \"If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit.\" A day later, on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" he said of Cuba, \"they're in a lot of trouble.\"",
      "Though he didn't detail any plans for Cuba or its leaders, Rubio said, \"I don't think it's any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro.\"",
      "Rubio highlighted the close ties between Venezuela and Cuba, noting that Maduro had relied on Cuban bodyguards for protection and said they were in charge of the Venezuelan government's \"internal intelligence.\" The Cuban government said 32 Cubans were killed during the military operation to capture Maduro.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump seems content to see how things play out on the island.",
      "\"I don't think we need any action\" in Cuba, he said, pointing out that Cuba \"now has no income \u2014 they got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They're not getting any of it. And Cuba literally is ready to fall.\"",
      "In the past year, Cuba's oil imports from Venezuela fell by 15%, to 27,400 barrels per day, according to Reuters, which also said that Cuba's supply from Mexico over the same period, from January to October, had dropped by 73%, to just 5,000 bpd.",
      "Colombia",
      "The president appears to have less patience for Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he has accused of illegal drug production and trafficking.",
      "\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday. Asked whether he was threatening to undertake a military operation in Colombia, the president replied, \"It sounds good to me. You know what \u2026 they kill a lot of people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has claimed that cocaine production has spiked during Petro's presidency, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced sanctions on Petro in October because he \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Petro has accused the U.S. of violating international law with its attacks on alleged drug boats, which have now killed at least 115 people, and he suggested that some innocent civilians may have been killed in the strikes. The U.S. denies that any innocent civilians have been killed in any of the boat strikes.",
      "Petro \u2014 who once belonged to a guerilla group \u2014 warned Mr. Trump against taking action in his country, writing on X that he \"swore never to touch a weapon again,\" but \"for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want.\"",
      "Canada",
      "While Mr. Trump has in the past talked about making Canada the \"51st state,\" he has not brought it up again since the Venezuela operation.",
      "But Mr. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs against Canada, raising the tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "In October, Mr. Trump threatened to end trade negotiations with Canada after an anti-tariff ad using Ronald Reagan's voice ran in Ontario. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pulled the ad, saying \"our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"",
      "Panama Canal",
      "Mr. Trump argued earlier in his term that the U.S. should regain control over the strategic Panama Canal \u2014 drawing flak from Panama's government. The U.S. oversaw the canal's construction in the early 20th century and controlled it for decades, but began handing the canal and surrounding land back over to Panama in 1979.",
      "He claimed in March that he was \"reclaiming the Panama Canal,\" referring to a deal by a U.S.-led consortium to buy a controlling stake in the company that operates ports near the canal. Panama's president accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "What is the Monroe Doctrine?",
      "In 1823, America's fifth president, James Monroe, outlined before Congress the U.S.' policy toward its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. It was initially intended to ward off European colonialism, but the Monroe administration also wanted to increase the U.S.' influence and trading alliances.",
      "During the Cold War, the U.S. cited the Monroe Doctrine to be used as a defense against the expansion of communism in Latin America.",
      "The phrase \"Don-roe Doctrine\" first appeared on the cover of the New York Post last year.",

      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",

      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",

Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Most Greenlanders don't want to be American",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that his country wants good relations with the U.S. and did not \"think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight, and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation.\"",
      "A poll conducted a year ago showed that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News ahead of a visit last year to the island by Vice President JD Vance and his wife.",

    "summary": "At least 29 Iranian protesters have reportedly been killed in unrest across the nation, putting its rulers under huge pressure after Trump threatened to intervene.",
    "story": [
      "At least 29 protesters have been killed as major anti-government demonstrations spread across Iran for a 10th day, a U.S.-based rights group says. The Iranian government is trying to quell the unrest, and reacted angrily to President Trump's veiled threat of a U.S. armed intervention.",
      "The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which gave the death toll based on its network of contacts in the country, said in its daily report on Monday that more than 1,200 people had been detained by Iranian security forces since the protests started more than a week ago. HRANA shared video on Tuesday that it said showed clashes between protesters and security forces at Tehran's Grand Bazaar \u2014 a center of commerce in the capital where shop owners have long backed the regime.",
      "The protests began more than a week ago in Tehran as business owners took to the streets to vent their frustration over soaring inflation in the nation, whose economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years. But the anger spread quickly to more than 250 locations in at least 27 of Iran's 31 provinces, according to the Washington-based HRANA, with social media videos showing violent clashes between protesters chanting anti-government slogans and security forces every night since.",
      "People who spoke with CBS News from inside the country on Tuesday said the latest demonstrations in the capital were relatively small, corroborating other reports that efforts by the Iranian authorities to placate the protesters have likely had some effect in reducing numbers in recent days.",
      "President Trump said Friday \u2014 a day before American forces attacked Venezuela and captured the country's longtime leader Nicolas Maduro \u2014 that the U.S. was \"locked and loaded and ready,\" warning that if Iran \"violently kills protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't offered any further detail on his threat, but he's been ratcheting up pressure on Tehran since taking office for his second term, including with unprecedented U.S. strikes on the country's nuclear facilities in June as Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war.",
      "\"I think many Iranian people will be inspired by that,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent Iranian news website IranWire, told CBS News on Saturday, referring to Mr. Trump's remarks. \"The message has made the Iranian regime more careful about its actions and using violence against people.\"",
      "Iranian officials have not confirmed the deaths of any protesters, and while acknowledging the demonstrations and economic pain felt in the country, they make little mention of the violence seen on the streets and accuse the U.S. and Israel of fomenting the unrest. The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency claimed Monday that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "The U.S. State Department has issued statements condemning specific incidents in Iran since Mr. Trump leveled his ambiguous threat, but the chances of an American intervention remained unclear on Tuesday.",
      "As has long been the case with Iran, the uncertainty left space for rumors to swirl. There were unconfirmed reports that the country's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was considering escaping into exile in Russia if the protests escalated out of control.",
      "Other reports have speculated that the government could even launch a new attack on Israel \u2014 something the regime has said it is ready for since the 12-day war in June \u2014 in a bid to divert attention away from domestic problems and refocus the population's anger at Iran's biggest foreign adversary, which would likely respond quickly and harshly.",
      "But Iran's intelligence services have a history of leaking false information to the media, especially foreign outlets, to create an exaggerated narrative that the country's leaders can then deny and portray as deliberate Western disinformation.",
      "In the meantime, the government has tried to quash the unrest on the streets not only with security forces, but with a series of measures aimed at showing sympathy with the protesters, including freezing some commodity prices and taxes on businesses, and even a dramatic move Monday to announce cash subsidies for essential goods for all households.",
      "The government does appear to have been bracing for unrest in the wake of the summer war with Israel, which constrained its sanctions-squeezed budgets even further and forced slashes to subsidies and social services.",
      "So far, however, even if the protests haven't continued escalating \u2014   which is difficult to gauge as Iran's government tightly controls the flow of information inside the country \u2014   the efforts to quell the unrest haven't fully succeeded.",
      "In the meantime, the demonstrations continue, as people wait for any further signals from Mr. Trump that he might be willing to try to take advantage of a vulnerable moment for the Islamic Republic's rulers.",

    "summary": "Top Trump aide Stephen Miller says it's the \"formal position\" of the White House that Denmark's territory of Greenland \"should be part of the U.S.\"",
    "story": [
      "European leaders released a joint statement Tuesday, outlining the importance of Arctic security, but stressing that \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" hours after White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said it was \"the formal position of the U.S. government... that Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Miller also said, in an interview Monday with CNN, that \"the United States is the power of NATO. For the United States to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend NATO and NATO interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Greenland has been a semi-autonomous  territory of Denmark, and has been tied to the small European nation for 300 years, though it has its own elected government. The largest island in the world, it is located to the northeast of Canada and is about the size of  Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to  only around 60,000 people.",
      "Its  location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both  economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "\"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up. We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries,\" the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the U.K. and Greenland said in their joint statement on Tuesday.",
      "\"Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them. The United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally and through the defense agreement between the Kingdom of Denmark and the United States of 1951,\" the U.S. allies said.",
      "\"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",
      "On Monday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance.",
      "\"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\" Frederiksen told local media on Monday. \"That is, including our NATO, and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\"",
      "When asked Tuesday if the U.S. would use military force to take over Greenland, Miller told CNN: \"The United States should have Greenland as part of the United States. There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking, of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers pushed back against the idea of asserting U.S. control over Greenland.",
      "Democratic Rep. Steny H. Hoyer and Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who co-chair the bipartisan Congressional Friends of Denmark Caucus, said in a joint statement that \"sabre-rattling about annexing Greenland is needlessly dangerous.\"",
      "They said any U.S. attack on Greenland \"would tragically be an attack on NATO.\"",
      "\"We already have access to everything we could need from Greenland,\" the two lawmakers said, noting that Denmark's government has already given the U.S. permission to deploy additional military forces there, or to build more missile defense infrastructure on the island.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 09:32:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. striking Venezuela and capturing its leader has practical implications for China, Russia, Iran and Cuba, and it also sends messages to each nation.",
    "story": [
      "The United States' biggest strategic adversaries quickly condemned President Trump's decision to order U.S. strikes on Venezuela and the raid to capture now-former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. China, Russia and Iran all called it a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty and international law. Cuba, just south of the U.S. and a close ally of Caracas, also condemned the attack as President Trump predicted his decisions could lead to the collapse of the government in Havana.",
      "As all of those countries had maintained close economic and political ties with the Maduro regime, the dramatic, unilateral U.S. action is likely to have some impact on them, and while that impact may not be tremendous financially in all cases, the message sent by Mr. Trump could be just as important.",
      "\"What I think is clear is that we're entering a new phase of great power competition,\" Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas Program and head of the Future of Venezuela Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS News. \"Some of the rules, some of the unthinkables, some of the things that we wouldn't have previously imagined being part of the operation are now on the table as options.\"",
      "A test of China's foothold in the Americas as it threatens Taiwan",
      "China, which buys most of Venezuela's oil, said it was \"deeply shocked\" by the weekend strikes and removal of Maduro, and the foreign ministry in Beijing said the U.S. had \"clearly violated international law\" with its actions.",
      "\"We have never believed that any country can act as the world's police, nor do we accept that any nation can claim to be the world's judge,\" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday, citing \"sudden developments in Venezuela\" without explicitly mentioning the U.S.",
      "\"The sovereignty and security of all countries should be fully protected under international law,\" he said, speaking for the first time since Maduro's capture by U.S. special forces.",
      "China's official foreign policy is broadly based on a position of neutrality when it comes to foreign conflicts, and despite Beijing's continuing economic support for Venezuela and unwavering political ties amid the standoff between Caracas and Washington, some analysts say China is unlikely to intervene directly.",
      "\"There isn't much in the way of material support that China can offer Venezuela at this time, but rhetorically, Beijing will be very important when it leads the effort at the U.N. and with other developing countries to rally opinion against the U.S.,\" Eric Olander, co-founder of the China-Global South Project, told the Reuters news agency. \"What we've seen in the cases of Zimbabwe and Iran, both sanctioned by the West, is that China demonstrates its commitment to these relationships through trade and investment, even under difficult circumstances.\"",
      "But that economic bond was likely far more vital to the geopolitically isolated Maduro regime than it was to China.",
      "China's purchases have amounted to a whopping 80% of Venezuela's total, relatively paltry petroleum exports, which Reuters said amounted to less than a million barrels per day during 2025 (compared to about 3 million barrels per day 25 years ago). According to Reuters, Venezuelan exports amounted to only about 4% of the oil China has purchased in recent years.",
      "But Berg said even if President Trump does get U.S. oil firms to move in and start rebuilding Venezuela's decrepit infrastructure to boost production, there are still financial implications for Beijing.",
      "\"The big question that remains unknown at this point is whether all of that production, and especially any increase in production in Venezuela that might occur, is going to come to the United States, or whether it will be sold on international markets,\" Berg told CBS News. \"Remember, Venezuela was sending about 80% of its oil to China. Much of that was to service debt. If China all of a sudden doesn't get that 80% of Venezuela's exports, it is not only losing energy security, but also in a situation where Venezuela is now no longer repaying its debts.\"",
      "\"There's a huge risk here for China that some of its energy security is in fact redirected away from China and toward the United States or toward other markets because of this play in Venezuela,\" Berg said. \"China has a way to make up for what Venezuela represented, but it is not going to be easy, especially as the United States is simultaneously squeezing Iran, one of its other top sources of oil.\"",
      "On the non-economic front, there's also concern that Chinese President Xi Jinping could use Trump's move as justification to launch his own unilateral military action, with an invasion of Taiwan, the U.S.-backed democratic island just off mainland China's coast.",
      "Taiwan punches well above its weight economically thanks to close ties with the West and as the world's most important producer of advanced semiconductors for artificial intelligence and weapons.",
      "Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has reiterated his policy of unifying China with Taiwan, and he has never ruled out the use of force to do so.",
      "Russia condemns \"destabilizing\" action, 4 years into its invasion of Ukraine",
      "In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin had still issued no public comment on the American attack on Venezuela by Tuesday, but former President Dmitry Medvedev, who often telegraphs the Kremlin's talking points, said Washington's actions were both \"illegal\" and \"destabilizing.\"",
      "Medvedev also said, however, that the moves ordered by Mr. Trump were in defense of U.S. national interests, given Venezuela's vast proven oil reserves.",
      "\"It must be acknowledged that, despite the obvious unlawfulness of Trump's behavior, one cannot deny a certain consistency in his actions,\" Medvedev said, according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency. \"He and his team defend their country's national interests quite harshly.\"",
      "Berg said the U.S. operation in Venezuela supports a philosophy held by Russia's government, which launched the ongoing war in Ukraine with its full-scale invasion of the resource-rich eastern part of the neighboring country nearly four years ago.",
      "\"The Russians have for a long time thought of themselves as a great power, and in their opinion, great powers get exclusive spheres of influence to behave how they wish. I think it guides much of their behavior in Eurasia, and certainly in Ukraine. And I think they think the same way about the United States,\" Berg said.",
      "Berg said Russia uses its relationships in what it perceives as the spheres of influence of other great powers to show its strength.",
      "\"Every time they are ready to pursue aggression in the European theater, it's almost like clockwork, they have a trip of a significant political official to Latin America and the Caribbean,\" Berg said.",
      "Russia did this ahead of its invasion of Georgia in 2008, for instance, when then-President Dmitry Medvedev visited Venezuela and Russia carried out joint naval exercises with Venezuelan forces. It was the first major Russian fleet deployment to the region since the end of the Cold War.",
      "As Russian forces seized control of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, meanwhile, Putin visited Brazil and met with Maduro and other Latin American leaders. Then, in a visit that ended less than a week before Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov visited Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.",
      "These were all \"significant diplomatic visits to Latin America that were meant to show visibility to the United States, and they presaged aggression in the European theater,\" Berg said.",
      "Iran grappling with protests under a threat from Trump",
      "Iranian government forces have been trying to quell protests against the country's rulers for 10 days \u2014 the most significant unrest to sweep the nation since 2022. So far, at least 29 protesters have been killed amid clashes with security personnel, the U.S.-based Human Rights News Agency group said Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week that if Iran, \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,\" warning that his administration was \"locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that Iran would \"not yield to the enemy,\" and reiterated a common claim that the U.S. and Israel were behind the anti-government unrest.",
      "But for some Iranians, desperate to see the end of more than four decades of rule by hardline Islamic clerics, the U.S. action against Venezuela has fueled hope that Mr. Trump might wield similar pressure tactics against their own authoritarian leadership.",
      "\"I think many Iranian people will be inspired by that (message), have been inspired by that,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the Iranian news site IranWire, told CBS News on Saturday. \"The message has made the Iranian regime more careful about its actions and using violence against people.\"",
      "\"I don't think (the protests) are going to lead to the toppling of the regime, because there is no alternative in sight,\" Bahari said. \"But there will be some change in the actions of the regime, change in the decisions of the regime, especially after President Trump's message.\"",
      "The protests across Iran were echoed in London over the weekend, where one demonstrator who said she would like to see the country's former Western-backed monarchy restored told CBS News she hoped Mr. Trump's action in Venezuela would send a signal to Tehran.",
      "\"What's happening in Venezuela is a kind of warning for the Islamic Republic. That's the message from America or Israel: 'That will happen to you, Khamenei.' That's the message,\" said the protester, who gave only her first name, Ghazal.",
      "When asked if she believed the people braving Iran's security forces to protest might also be looking at Venezuela and hoping for similar action in their own nation, Ghazal reiterated her optimism.",
      "\"Definitely something will change, and the Islamic Republic will fall down very soon,\" she said.",
      "Trump says \"Cuba looks like it is ready to fall\"",
      "A day after the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Mr. Trump predicted to journalists on Air Force One that Cuba's 67-year-old communist government could soon collapse as a result of the operation.",
      "\"Cuba looks like it is ready to fall,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday. \"I don't know if they're going to hold out, but Cuba now has no income. They got all their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil.\"",
      "\"What President Trump was referring to is actually internal regime collapse,\" Berg said, stressing that Cuba is \"going through one of the worst moments that it's had since the 1990s,\" when the Soviet Union dissolved, taking its support for the Caribbean island nation with it.",
      "\"I imagine that one of the demands of the new government in Venezuela would be to cut off the shipments of barrels of oil to Cuba, some of which is used to satisfy the domestic demand within Cuba, but also a lot of it sent onwards and sold to other markets for profit,\" Berg told CBS News. \"If that support dries up, Cuba will be in an even tougher position.\"",
      "Maduro was an important economic and political partner to Cuba, and the government in Havana said 32 Cuban nationals were killed in the U.S. operation in Venezuela \u2014 security forces who were there serving at Venezuela's request.",
      "\"For that sister nation and for her people, we are ready to give, as for Cuba, from our own blood,\" the Cuban government said in a statement Saturday, condemning the U.S. operation. Cuba's government called on the international community to condemn the U.S. actions and impose consequences.",
      "\"All of the nations in the region should be on alert, because the threat hangs over all of them,\" the statement said.",
      "But even if the current government in Cuba does collapse, Berg doesn't foresee a pro-American regime taking its place.",
      "\"When it comes to the Cuban regime, we have decades and decades of anti-Americanism \u2014 so-called anti-imperialism,\" he said, calling a \"night-to-day flip to become pro-American and pursue policies that somehow give them autonomy from U.S. pressure\" highly unlikely.",

      "Geneva \u2014 Fire safety inspections hadn't been carried out for several years at the bar where a fire that broke out at a New Year's party left 40 people dead and over 100 injured, local authorities said Tuesday.",
      "Investigators have said they believe festive sparkling candles atop Champagne bottles ignited the fire at Le Constellation in the resort town of Crans-Montana when they came too close to the ceiling. Authorities are looking into whether soundproofing material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar.",
      "Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the bar managers. The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, according to the Valais region's chief prosecutor.",
      "Regional authorities have said that safety inspections are the responsibility of the municipality. On Tuesday, the Crans-Montana municipality said inspections of Le Constellation that included fire safety checks had been carried out in 2016, 2018 and 2019, and that modifications had been requested - but no issues with soundproofing measures had been raised.",
      "The local council discovered after consulting documents after the fire that \"periodic checks were not carried out between 2020 and 2025,\" the head of Crans-Montana's municipal government, Nicolas F\u00e9raud, told a news conference.",
      "\"We regret this bitterly,\" he said, adding that it will be up to judicial authorities to determine what influence that may have had on the chain of events that led to the fire. \"We owe it to the families, and we will accept responsibility,\" F\u00e9raud\u00a0 said.",
      "\"This tragedy has brought a sentiment of uncertainty all across the region. We're now putting everything in order to reassure\" people, he said.",
      "F\u00e9raud said he couldn't immediately explain why safety inspections hadn't been conducted for such a long time.",
      "He said that in September last year, an external expert had been asked to carry out a soundproofing analysis and had concluded that the bar complied with anti-noise rules, without making further remarks.",
      "The severity of burns made it difficult to identify some victims of the fire that broke out at about 1:30 a.m. on New Year's Day, requiring families to supply authorities with DNA samples.",
      "Investigators finished identifying the 40 dead on Sunday and said on Monday that they had identified all 116 people who were injured.",
      "F\u00e9raud said reports from the inspections that were carried out mentioned a maximum capacity of 100 people on the bar's ground floor and 100 in its basement. It's unclear how many people were in Le Constellation when the blaze broke out and investigators have said that may never be known.",
      "The municipality said the bar's owner obtained a permit to build a veranda in 2015 and also carried out interior work at the bar that did not require a permit.",
      "It said it has now decided to ban the use of fireworks indoors and to commission an external agency to carry out inspections of such establishments.",

      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz defended American military actions in Venezuela during an emergency meeting at the United Nations on Monday, and argued that there is no regime change nor U.S. occupation. He repeated the Trump administration's argument that the air and ground assault was not an attack but rather military force used as a tool to assist a law enforcement operation.",
      "\"As Secretary Rubio has said, there is no war against Venezuela or its people. We are not occupying a country,\" Waltz said, according to the readout. \"This was a law enforcement operation in furtherance of lawful indictments that have existed for decades. The United States arrested a narcotrafficker who is now going to stand trial in the United States in accordance with the rule of law for the crimes he's committed against our people for 15 years.\"",
      "\"This is not regime change this is justice,\" Waltz wrote in a social media post on Saturday.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he is \"deeply alarmed by the recent escalation in Venezuela,\" saying it has \"potential worrying implications for the region.\"",
      "\"The Secretary-General calls on all actors in Venezuela to engage in inclusive dialogue, in full respect of human rights and the rule of law,\" the statement said.",
      "France's foreign minister has already condemned the operation as violating international law, although President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that he \"neither supported nor approved\" the operation, according to France 24.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Margaret Brennan on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters\" when pressed as to whether the U.S. had ruled out an occupation of Venezuela. Rubio argued that President Trump would not explicitly rule out anything and maintained the power to invoke military force if there are imminent threats. He emphasized that economic pressure was the main tool being used on the remaining indicted regime members who currently run the country.",
      "As noted by Brennan, other officials in Maduro's government who are still in power in Venezuela, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, who have also been indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and have multi-million dollar U.S. government bounties on their heads. Rubio argued Sunday that it was not feasible to arrest four individuals in five different locations in a single complex raid and that there would have been outcry if the U.S. attempted to do so.",
      "\"Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority,\" Rubio said.",
      "As for the Trump administration's ability to control the current regime, Rubio emphasized that the main pressure remains cutting off their financial lifelines.",
      "\"What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,\" Rubio said.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "With Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in U.S. custody, who is Venezuela's new acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, and what are her chances of remaining in power?",
    "story": [
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in early Monday as Venezuela's new interim president while her predecessor Nicol\u00e1s Maduro awaited arraignment in a federal U.S. court on drug smuggling charges, two days after he was captured in Caracas by American special forces.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez, 56, is a powerful figure and longtime confidant of Maduro, and she has been backed thus far as the nation's new leader by Venezuela's military. She served as Venezuela's vice president from 2018 until Sunday.",
      "Her brother also holds a senior role in the government as president of the National Assembly, Venezuela's legislature, which has long been controlled by the Maduro regime.",
      "She quickly denounced the U.S. operation as a violation of the United Nations founding charter and a unilateral attempt to force regime change on Saturday, but soon adopted a more conciliatory tone.",
      "In a\u00a0social media post following a Cabinet meeting on Sunday, Rodr\u00edguez called for \"respectful international relations\" between Caracas and Washington and extended an invite for \"the U.S. government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation.\"",
      "Venezuela's roughly 30 million people face a deeply uncertain future in the wake of President Trump's actions. It was still unclear on Monday how much autonomy Washington will allow the country, given Mr. Trump's assertion that America will \"run\" Venezuela, at least for some time.",
      "Will the U.S. work with Rodr\u00edguez?",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that the U.S. had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez and \"she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "But in an interview with\u00a0The Atlantic published on Sunday, he added a warning.",
      "\"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated in a Sunday interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the U.S. was willing to give Rodr\u00edguez a chance.",
      "\"We are going to make our assessments of people,\" he said of the remaining Maduro regime figures still in place. \"We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what, you know, some of what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward.\"",
      "Speaking on ABC's \"This Week\" the same day, Rubio reiterated, however, that the Trump administration does not consider Rodr\u00edguez or any of her cohorts to have any legitimate claim to power in the country.",
      "\"This is not about the legitimate president. We don't believe that this regime in place is legitimate via an election,\" Rubio told ABC.",
      "\"Ultimately, legitimacy for their system of government will come about through a period of transition and real elections,\" he continued. \"It's the reason why Maduro is not just an indicted drug trafficker \u2014 he [was an] illegitimate president. He was not the head of state.\"",
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez's rise to power in Venezuela",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas. Her father was Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a prominent leader of the country's socialist movement that would go on to take power under Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez. The new president's father, however, helped lead the movement before it seized power, and he was arrested for involvement in the kidnapping of American businessman William Niehous in 1976.",
      "He died in police custody, reportedly as he was tortured by the previous Venezuelan regime's security forces.",
      "His daughter Delcy would go on to study law at the Central University of Venezuela, in Caracas, with further periods of education in Britain and France.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez held a number of positions during Ch\u00e1vez's long reign, but she only rose to real prominence under Maduro. From 2013 to 2014, she served as Minister of Popular Power for Communication and Information before being appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, a title she held from 2014 to 2017.",
      "She also presided over an assembly created in response to mass street protests in 2017, which was widely seen as an attempt to sideline the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Venezuela's legislature, to enable Maduro to consolidate his rule.",
      "In 2018, Maduro appointed her as Venezuela's vice president, and she remained in that post until stepping in to replace her former boss, as ordered by the country's supreme court following the dramatic events of the weekend.",
      "In 2020, Rodr\u00edguez was also appointed as her country's Minister of Economy and Finance, where she's credited with helping to achieve some progress toward stabilizing Venezuela's sanctions-wracked economy after years of soaring inflation.",
      "In 2024, the role of Minister of Petroleum was also added to her resume.",
      "Despite her very high profile role in the Maduro regime, however, Rodr\u00edguez has not been indicted on any criminal charges in the U.S., though she was hit with sanctions imposed during President Trump's first term, for her role in helping Maduro \"maintain power and solidify his authoritarian rule.\"",

      "In 1965, Sonny & Cher made their breakthrough with the success of their song \"I Got You, Babe,\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The duo, who officially married in 1969, went on to release scores of other hits with Bono handling songwriting, production and business, while Cher was the breakout star and the duo's main draw.",
      "Their success later expanded into television when they launched the variety show \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" which made them household names in the early 1970s.",
      "While appearing on \"Armchair Expert,\" Cher explained that her relationship with Bono began to unravel at the height of their fame as he began to increasingly control her day-to-day decisions.",
      "The former couple formed the iconic musical duo \"Sonny & Cher.\" (Harry Langdon/Getty Images)",
      "\"This is when now this kind of new side of Sonny comes out,\" Shepard said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Cher agreed with a nod.",
      "\"Which is like incredibly controlling,\" Shepard continued. \"You have this huge success. There's a lot of money. You're not allowed to leave the house. You're allowed to go shopping. That's pretty much all you're allowed to do, right?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Cher said.",
      "\"And he's cutting you off from friendships you have,\" Shepard said. \"Was it happening slowly? Was it more like you woke up one day and were like, 'Oh, I don't have a life' or while it was happening, were you like, 'What's going on?'\"",
      "\"It took a little while,\" Cher admitted. \"I couldn't do anything.\"",
      "Cher recounted how she began learning to play tennis and would practice at a friend's house. The \"Believe\" hitmaker recalled a harrowing incident that occurred after Bono discovered that she had been seen at her friend's home during a party after playing tennis.",
      "\"I'm leaving, but she's having a huge party. So there are people coming in,\" she recalled. \"And so Dennis, my friend, told Sonny that I was there, but lots of people were there and lots of men were there.\"",
      "\"And he burned my clothes,\" Cher said. \"In the yard.\"",
      "Cher described Bono's controlling behavior and recalled that he once burned her clothes in the yard during a fit of rage.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Cher explained that her realization of how Bono was exerting excessive power over her life \"came on kind of slowly.\" The Grammy Award winner said that part of her difficulty with fully grasping the situation stemmed from the difference between how Bono treated her on the set of \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\" and his behavior at home.",
      "\"I was free on the show, and he was funny, and we got along,\" Cher remembered. \"It's such a strange dichotomy because we would be laughing, and we'd be having the best time and then when we were at home, it was kind of more cut and dried.\"",
      "CHER WAS 'SHOCKED' WHEN SHE DISCOVERED LEGAL NAME DECADES AFTER BIRTH CERTIFICATE ERROR",
      "Cher recalled that she also discovered that Bono was cheating on her during the rocky later years of their marriage. After Shepard remarked that Bono had \"lots of other girlfriends,\" Cher told him, \"I didn't know except the one.\"",
      "Shepard cited an incident that Cher wrote about in her 1998 memoir \"The First Time,\" in which she went to get a glass of water in the middle of the night and found another woman \"putting her boots on\" in the home the singer shared with Bono.",
      "Cher told Shepard that she had no thoughts of leaving Bono at the time despite the shocking incident. She explained that she stayed in the relationship largely due to \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.\" However, she clarified that her reluctance to leave wasn't because she was driven to preserve the show's massive success.",
      "\"It wasn't that, because I was so happy with the show. And he was so nice on the show. And so, at the show we would be having the best time, and we were more working than we were at home,\" she said. \"It was such a polar opposite, because on stage we had a blast. He let me have all the freedom that I wanted to, and then we came home.\"",
      "\"The show kept us together a lot longer than we would have been anyway, because we had such a good time,\" she continued. \"He was so fun, and he was so funny, and we worked so well together.\"",
      "The two found success with their show \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.\"\u00a0 (CBS)",
      "However, Cher recalled that she grew increasingly unhappy with their marriage and her lack of autonomy amid the power imbalance. In February 1974, they decided to divorce, and their show was canceled two months later.",
      "CHER CELEBRATES 77TH BIRTHDAY ON SOCIAL MEDIA QUESTIONING AGE: \u2018WHEN WILL I FEEL OLD?\u2019",
      "Shepard recalled that Cher only learned how little control she had over the money that she and Bono had earned during the divorce proceeding after Cher's friend and music executive David Geffen asked to review her contract.",
      "\"It's not until Geffen looks at this contract and says to you, 'Do you realize 100% of this money goes to a company called Cher Inc. that is owned 95% by Sonny and 5% by his lawyer?'\"",
      "\"0% for Cher?\" Shepard's co-host Monica Padman asked in disbelief.",

      "\"Yeah, what are you going to do \u2014 read 20 pages of legalese?\" Shepard said.",
      "\"And the next day, he said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get out of this,'\" Cher recalled of Geffen. \"So I went to Sonny and I said, 'I'll stay with you if we're partners. And he said no.'\"",

    "summary": "The first-ever fentanyl overdose prevention vaccine could save thousands of lives annually, with human trials beginning in early 2026 after animal studies.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson has the latest on how a biotech company plans to test its vaccine that could protect people from fentanyl's lethal effects on 'Special Report.'",
      "A vaccine to protect against fentanyl\u2019s deadly effects is headed for clinical trials in humans.",
      "The vaccine, which showed positive results in studies of mice and rats, is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses.",
      "If approved, it would become the first treatment to prevent overdoses of fentanyl, which is the leading cause of drug overdose deaths, statistics show.",
      "DEADLY DRUG MIX DRIVES STAGGERING RISE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AMONG SENIORS",
      "This is different than treatments like naloxone, which reverse the effects after an overdose.",
      "How it works",
      "The vaccine is designed to create antibodies against fentanyl, which keeps the drug from crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier.",
      "It contains a synthetic fragment of fentanyl attached to a protein called CRM197, along with dmLT, an immune-activating compound.",
      "The vaccine is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses. (iStock)",
      "This combination stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that capture fentanyl in the bloodstream before it can reach the brain, according to the University of Houston's Colin Haile, co-founder and scientific advisor of ARMR Sciences, which licensed the vaccine.",
      "\"In a vaccinated individual, those anti-fentanyl antibodies are in the blood,\" Haile told Fox News Digital. \"So, if they consume fentanyl, the antibodies grab onto the drug and prevent it from getting into the brain. They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "Eventually, he said, the fentanyl would be eliminated from the body.",
      "MAJOR CANNABIS STUDY FINDS LITTLE PROOF FOR POPULAR MEDICAL CLAIMS, FLAGS BIG DANGERS",
      "In the mice and rat studies, the animals still had antibodies against fentanyl six months after vaccination, added Haile, who is also a research associate professor of psychology at UH and a founding member of the UH Drug Discovery Institute.",
      "While some have questioned whether such a vaccine would indirectly encourage drug use, Haile pointed out that, for vaccinated people, the drug would have \"no euphoric effects.\" So, those seeking a \"high\" would not get it.",
      "Fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana. (iStock)",
      "The main benefit, according to Haile, is that the vaccine would reduce the potential health dangers of fentanyl.",
      "\"Respiratory depression is the primary effect that induces death from this highly potent synthetic opioid,\" he said.",
      "Headed for trials",
      "Following successful testing in mice and rats, the first human clinical trial is slated to begin in early 2026 at the Center for Human Drug Research, which is associated with the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.",
      "\"They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "The small Phase 1 trial will enroll about 40 participants, focusing on safety and immune response.",
      "After the Phase 1 trial for safety, a Phase 2 trial will test whether the vaccine effectively blocks fentanyl\u2019s effects in humans.",
      "Potential risks and limitations",
      "The primary limitation is that data so far is available only for mouse models, and it\u2019s unknown how effective the vaccine would be in humans.",
      "Haile told Fox News Digital there were no adverse side effects reported in the animal study, likely because the ingredients of the vaccine are proteins that have already been used in other combinations in humans, so their safety profile is already known.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "\"Also, unlike other vaccines, we use extremely low doses of the components,\" he noted. \"We have put the vaccine into a lot of animals and have not seen any adverse side effects at all.\"",
      "Even in a toxicology study, during which the researchers administered 20 times the dose of the vaccine that would be given to humans, they still saw no overt signs of toxicity, according to Haile.",
      "Potential use cases",
      "Haile mentioned several different use cases for the vaccine, primarily those with opioid use disorder who want to quit using fentanyl.",
      "It could also be used by first responders and healthcare workers who want to reduce the risk of accidental exposure.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Military and national security personnel could also benefit from the vaccine, Haile said, as it could help protect against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds that have been used as chemical threats.",
      "Finally, parents may be seeking protection for at-risk teens or young adults, as fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana.",
      "The progress of the vaccine is a \"very exciting advance with a huge upside,\" a medical expert said. (iStock)",
      "Looking ahead, Haile said this could pave the way for the approval of other anti-drug vaccines, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, which are already in the works.",
      "\"If we can tackle the primary ones \u2014 fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine \u2014 we will be saving hundreds of thousands of lives,\" he added.",
      "\"This is likely to prevent many overdoses where a patient is sedated and stops breathing as a result of fentanyl.\"",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, senior medical analyst for Fox News, said the progress of the vaccine is a \"very exciting advance with a huge upside.\"",
      "\"I am very glad it is now entering human trials. It is being very well-studied,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"This is likely to prevent many overdoses where a patient is sedated and stops breathing as a result of fentanyl.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "The antidote for fentanyl (Narcan) is limited because fentanyl lasts for many hours, but the Narcan (an opioid antagonist) wears off after only a few hours and has to be administered again, Siegel pointed out.",

      "\"Varying movements, intensities and rhythms force the body to adapt, helping to activate all muscle groups more effectively,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a bit of a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 philosophy \u2014 if we don\u2019t actively support flexibility and mobility, we risk losing them.\"",

      "The Five co-hosts discuss Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's decision to not seek re-election amid fraud scandal.",
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has dropped his re-election bid this week in the wake of revelations of massive fraud that occurred under his watch \u2014 potentially ending the political career of a governor who came into office with consolidated support, accomplished several progressive goals, and shot to the national spotlight as a vice presidential candidate before being undone by scandal.",
      "The 61-year-old Walz was raised in rural Nebraska and enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1981, soon after graduating from high school. Walz returned to Nebraska to attend Chadron State College, where he graduated in 1989 with a degree in social science education.",
      "He taught English and American History in China for one year through a program at Harvard University before being hired in 1990 as a high school teacher and football and basketball coach in Nebraska. Six years later, he moved to Mankato, Minnesota, to teach geography at Mankato West High.",

      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announces that he would not be seeking re-election Monday, Jan. 5, 2026. (Jerry Holt/The Minnesota Star Tribune via Getty Images)",
      "Walz was elected to Congress in 2006 to represent Minnesota's 1st Congressional District, defeating a 6-term Republican incumbent, and built a reputation as a centrist-to-moderate Democrat, especially on veterans\u2019 issues, agriculture, and education while serving as a National Guard member in Congress.",
      "In March 2017, he announced a run for governor, leaving the Washington gridlock and emphasizing a \"One Minnesota\" message and took office in January 2019 with consolidated support from the Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party.",
      "\"Tim Walz rose at a moment of maximum political upheaval,\" retired Minnesota State Patrol Lt. John Nagel, running for Congress as a Republican to unseat Minnesota Dem. Rep. Ilhan Omar, told Fox News Digital. \"After the George Floyd protests, Democrats consolidated power in Minnesota, the media closed ranks, and Walz benefited from a narrative that treated him less as a governor subject to scrutiny and more as a symbol of progressive governance.\"",
      "HOW FEARS OF BEING LABELED 'RACIST' HELPED 'PROVIDE COVER' FOR THE EXPLODING MINNESOTA FRAUD SCANDAL",
      "Tim Walz was elected governor in 2018 and was re-elected in 2022. (Christopher Mark Juhn/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "On social media in recent days, many have speculated that Walz being elevated to the presidential ticket alongside Kamala Harris brought a level of public scrutiny that ultimately contributed to his waning popularity.",
      "In August 2024, roughly two weeks after Harris stepped in to run for president after President Joe Biden withdrew himself from the race, Harris announced Walz as her running mate, touting his resume as a \"governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran.\"",
      "\"He's delivered for working families like his,\" Harris said.",
      "Walz said in an interview earlier this year that Harris chose him, in part, because, \"I could code talk to White guys watching football, fixing their truck\" and \"put them at ease.\" He described himself as the \"permission structure\" for White men from rural America to vote for Democrats.",
      "Almost immediately, Walz was enveloped in scrutiny over his record and criticism for several high-profile gaffes, including stolen valor allegations and a claim he was present at the Tiananmen Square massacre that he was forced to walk back with the explanation that he is a \"knucklehead at times.\"",
      "Ultimately, many political pundits viewed Harris' decision to pick Walz over other potential running mates like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as a misstep and Harris herself wrote in her book, \"107 Days,\" about her disappointment in Walz's vice presidential debate performance, saying that being the \"closer\" and debating on such a large scale was \"not a comfortable role\" for Walz.",
      "During his time as governor, Walz notched several progressive victories, including signing a $2.3 billion education budget \u2014 the biggest in Minnesota\u2019s history \u2014 funding expanded free meals for students, thousands of new pre-K seats, and increased mental health resources in schools.",
      "In 2023, Walz signed into law the Protect Reproductive Options Act, making Minnesota one of the most abortion-friendly states in the wake of the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade.",
      "Other legislation Walz signed into law included the Minnesota Voting Rights Act, a $2.6 billion bipartisan infrastructure package, and a paid leave law that Democrats had long pushed for.",
      "MEDIA \u2018COMPLICITY\u2019 BLAMED AS FEDS SAY MINNESOTA FRAUD CRISIS COULD REACH $9B: 'SHOWN THEIR TRUE COLORS'",
      "Walz launched his bid for a third four-year term as Minnesota governor in September, but in recent weeks has been facing a barrage of incoming political fire from President Donald Trump and Republicans, and some Democrats, over the large-scale theft in a state that has long prided itself on good governance.",
      "More than 90 people \u2014 most from Minnesota's large Somali community \u2014 have been charged since 2022 in what has been described as the nation's largest COVID-era scheme. How much money has been stolen through alleged money laundering operations involving fraudulent meal and housing programs, daycare centers, and Medicaid services is still being tabulated. But the U.S. attorney in Minnesota said the scope of the fraud could exceed $1 billion and rise to as high as $9 billion.",
      "\"The fraud scandals shattered the image,\" Nagel told Fox News Digital. \"They weren\u2019t just policy failures \u2014 they were failures of leadership and oversight. Once federal investigators stepped in and national media paid attention, the contrast between the narrative and the reality became impossible to ignore.\"",
      "Fraud concerns in Minnesota had been an open secret in Minnesota for years, dating back to when Walz took office, but exploded in recent months to the national forefront, leading to calls from prominent Republicans for him to resign.",
      "\"As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can\u2019t give a political campaign my all,\" Walz wrote in a statement. \"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can\u2019t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.\"",
      "\"So I\u2019ve decided to step out of this race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work in front of me for the next year,\" the governor added in his statement and in front of cameras a couple of hours later.",

      "Some political pundits last year had viewed Walz as a possible contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. Such talk is obviously over amid the Minnesota fraud scandal and the governor's stunning move to end his re-election bid.",
      "Veteran Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso told Fox News Digital that Democrats, heading into 2028, need someone younger than 60, not attached to the Harris 2024 campaign, \"an executive with a proven track record of leveraging government programs to serve others, not wasting taxpayer dollars, and a candidate with emotional intelligence matched with unscripted rhetoric that connects with someone at a wrestling match or a local bar and in southern states.\"",
      "\"Waltz is a good man. A folksy man. But he is not a \u2018fresh\u2019 take. He does not check any of these boxes,\" Ceraso emphasized.",
      "Walz's daughter, Hope, gave some insight this week into why he ended his bid for a third term, including a dig at Trump.",
      "\"I think he believes if he's not in the race, there's nothing, they [Republicans] have nothing else because he has that, you know, national profile,\" she said. \"Trump just hates him for some reason. I think it's because he's everything Trump will never be.\"",
      "Walz took several swipes at conservatives in his Monday announcement, at one point claiming Republicans are \"playing politics with the future of our state.\"",
      "Conservative New Hampshire radio host Chris Ryan told Fox News Digital, \"Apparently all the mirrors at the Governor's mansion in Minnesota are broken.\"",
      "\"It's not Republicans' fault that a massive fraud scandal is ending Tim Walz re-election bid, it\u2019s his lack of ability to identify and address the scandal in a way that satisfies Minnesota voters.\"",
      "Ultimately, Nagel told Fox News Digital, \"Walz\u2019s rise was powered by crisis politics and party loyalty,\" Nagel said. \"His fall came when accountability finally caught up. That arc should be a warning about what happens when power goes unchecked for too long.\"",
      "\"In the end, Tim Walz wasn\u2019t undone by his critics \u2014 he was undone by the absence of accountability that surrounded him for too long and his belief that legacy media outlets would continue to whitewash his record.\"",

      "According to a timeline put out by the committee, the FBI\u2019s probe of Crowder first began in January 2021, when an anonymous tipster claimed to have recognized her in news coverage of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol Building.",
      "Despite an initial negative match for her face and geolocation, the FBI expanded its probe, and, for the better part of two years, conducted physical surveillance of the Crowder household, put her on a travel watchlist, secured a warrant for her Facebook account and even prepared a prosecution case against her, the report said.",

      "According to the committee, Crowder\u2019s case surfaced as a part of a larger investigation into whether Biden-era federal agencies used flight watchlists to conduct politically motivated surveillance under their Quiet Skies Program. Crowder's case also overlaps with religious profiling memos used internally by the FBI under the Biden administration.",
      "Lawmakers had previously uncovered internal FBI communications under the Biden administration that, in 2022, had targeted traditionalist Catholic places of worship in Richmond. In the view of an FBI memo, those churches were suspected of radicalizing ethnically motivated extremists. The FBI rescinded the memo after a whistleblower released the memo to the public.",

      "Those same Republican concerns about weaponized suspicions extended to the Quiet Skies Program \u2014 a surveillance initiative that has since been terminated under the Trump administration. It sought to monitor targets who could post security risks, but who hadn\u2019t formally been designated as threats by federal agencies.",
      "Republicans feared that the program created an amorphous gray area that allowed for travel surveillance even without a credible danger to national security.",

      "The group behind it is now known as DarkSpectre. According to Koi researchers, it infected more than 8.8 million users across Chrome, Edge and Firefox over seven years. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It was slow, deliberate and highly organized. Instead of rushing malicious code into marketplaces, the group played the long game.",

      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Security researchers say millions of users unknowingly installed browser extensions that later turned malicious after years of appearing legitimate. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "One threat actor behind three major campaigns",
      "At first, the activity looked like separate threats. That changed once Koi analysts followed the infrastructure breadcrumbs. By pivoting from domains linked to ShadyPanda, Koi researchers uncovered shared systems powering multiple extension clusters. That analysis confirmed that ShadyPanda, GhostPoster and Zoom Stealer were not separate actors. They were one coordinated operation. Together, these campaigns targeted both everyday users and corporate environments.",
      "This campaign focused on mass surveillance and affiliate fraud. Researchers estimate it affected\u00a0more than 4 million users, with some analyses suggesting the total could reach up to 5.6 million as additional related extensions were linked. In several cases, extensions remained legitimate for more than five years before quietly turning malicious.",
      "This campaign used a clever trick. It hid malicious code inside image files to bypass security checks. It impacted 1.05 million users.",
      "This operation targeted corporate meeting data across more than 28 conferencing platforms. It affected 2.2 million users.",
      "Different goals. Same operator.",
      "How Koi uncovered DarkSpectre's hidden network",
      "The breakthrough came when Koi analysts examined two domains tied to ShadyPanda. Those domains powered legitimate extension features like weather widgets and new tab pages. They were not command servers. That was the trick. Those same clean domains appeared again and again across other extensions that quietly connected to entirely different malicious infrastructure.",
      "One domain led to extensions. Those extensions exposed new domains. Those domains were connected to even more extensions. Following that chain allowed Koi to uncover over 100 connected extensions across multiple browser marketplaces. Some extensions even reused infrastructure already flagged in earlier investigations. That overlap confirmed DarkSpectre was operating at a nation-state scale.",
      "How DarkSpectre stayed hidden for years",
      "DarkSpectre succeeded by blending legitimate functionality with hidden malware. Users got what they expected. Meanwhile, the threat ran quietly in the background.",
      "Some extensions waited days before activating malicious behavior. Others triggered malware on only a small percentage of page loads. This made detection during marketplace reviews extremely difficult.",
      "The group hid JavaScript inside PNG image files. The extension loaded its own logo, extracted the hidden code and executed it silently.",
      "Instead of pushing new extension versions, DarkSpectre controlled everything from its servers. Operators could change behavior anytime without alerting users or marketplaces. Koi researchers noted this approach gave the attackers long-term flexibility and control.",
      "Why the Zoom Stealer campaign stands out",
      "Most malware focuses on consumer fraud. Zoom Stealer focused on intelligence.",
      "According to Koi analysts, these extensions collected the following:",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwordsMeeting IDs, topics and schedulesSpeaker names, titles, bios and photosCompany affiliations and branding",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwords",
      "Meeting IDs, topics and schedules",
      "Speaker names, titles, bios and photos",
      "Company affiliations and branding",
      "Worse yet, the data streamed in real time. The moment a user joined or viewed a meeting, the information flowed out. This type of data enables phishing impersonation and corporate espionage at scale.",
      "Why browser extensions remain a weak link",
      "Extension marketplaces typically evaluate code only at submission or update. Koi's investigation shows how attackers exploit that model. Once an extension earns trust badges and positive reviews, users stop questioning it. That trust becomes a weapon. A clean extension today can become a threat tomorrow.",
      "Ways to stay safe from malicious browser extensions",
      "You do not need to avoid extensions entirely. You do need to stay cautious.",
      "Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it.",
      "Remove anything you no longer use. Fewer extensions reduce risk. CyberGuy has step-by-step guides showing how to review and remove browser extensions safely, making it easy to clean up your browser in just a few minutes. In Chrome, Edge and Firefox, open the\u00a0menu, go to\u00a0Extensions or Add-ons, and\u00a0remove anything you do not use or trust.",
      "Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",

      "A long-running malware operation quietly abused trusted browser extensions across Chrome, Edge and Firefox, infecting millions worldwide. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Strong antivirus software can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. A data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.",
      "It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag. Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension\u2019s been sold or hacked.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via the browser's built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then, consider switching to a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Analysts uncovered a coordinated campaign that hid spyware inside everyday browser tools like new tab pages and translators. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Subtle changes often appear before obvious damage. Sudden redirects, new tabs opening on their own, unfamiliar search results, popups, slower browsing or websites asking you to re-log in unexpectedly can all signal a malicious or compromised extension. Pay attention if ads appear where they never did before or if your browser settings change without your input.",
      "Koi's investigation shows how attackers rely on patience. Once an extension earns trust and sits quietly for years, users stop watching it. That makes small behavior changes easy to miss. If something feels off, do not ignore it. Disable extensions one by one to identify the culprit. If the issue disappears, remove that extension permanently.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "DarkSpectre is a reminder that online threats are getting smarter and quieter. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It unfolded slowly, over years, and relied on trust most people never think twice about. Koi analysts connected the dots by tracking shared infrastructure across campaigns, but they also warn that some sleeper extensions may still be installed and trusted today. Browser extensions can be helpful, but every extra add-on is another door into your browser. Paying attention, cleaning house now and then, and questioning what you install can make a real difference.",

      "Chrome extensions are supposed to make your browser more useful, but they've quietly become one of the easiest ways for attackers to spy on what you do online. Security researchers recently uncovered two Chrome extensions that have been doing exactly that for years.",
      "These extensions looked like harmless proxy tools, but behind the scenes, they were hijacking traffic and stealing sensitive data from users who trusted them. What makes this case worse is where these extensions were found. Both were listed on Chrome's official extension marketplace.",

      "Security researchers uncovered malicious Chrome extensions that quietly routed users\u2019 web traffic through attacker-controlled servers to steal sensitive data. (Gokhan Balci/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",
      "Malicious Chrome extensions hiding in plain sight",
      "Researchers at Socket discovered two Chrome extensions using the same name, \"Phantom Shuttle,\" that were posing as tools for proxy routing and network speed testing (via Bleeping Computer). According to the researchers, the extensions have been active since at least 2017.",
      "Both extensions were published under the same developer name and marketed toward foreign trade workers who need to test internet connectivity from different regions. They were sold as subscription-based tools, with prices ranging from roughly $1.40 to $13.60.",
      "At a glance, everything looked normal. The descriptions matched the functionality. The pricing seemed reasonable. The problem was what the extensions were doing after installation.",
      "How Phantom Shuttle steals your data",
      "Socket researchers say Phantom Shuttle routes all your web traffic through proxy servers controlled by the attacker. Those proxies use hardcoded credentials embedded directly into the extension's code. To avoid detection, the malicious logic is hidden inside what appears to be a legitimate jQuery library.",
      "The attackers didn't just leave credentials sitting in plain text. The extensions hide them using a custom character-index encoding scheme. Once active, the extension listens to web traffic and intercepts HTTP authentication challenges on any site you visit.",
      "To make sure traffic always flows through their infrastructure, the extensions dynamically reconfigure Chrome's proxy settings using an auto-configuration script. This forces your browser to route requests exactly where the attacker wants them.",
      "In its default \"smarty\" mode, Phantom Shuttle routes traffic from more than 170 high-value domains through its proxy network. That list includes developer platforms, cloud service dashboards, social media sites and adult content portals. Local networks and the attacker's own command-and-control domain are excluded, likely to avoid breaking things or raising suspicion.",
      "While acting as a man-in-the-middle, the extension can capture anything you submit through web forms. That includes usernames, passwords, card details, personal information, session cookies from HTTP headers and API tokens pulled directly from network requests.",

      "Artificial intelligence chatbots are quickly becoming part of our daily lives. Many of us turn to them for ideas, advice or conversation. For most, that interaction feels harmless. However, mental health experts now warn that for a small group of vulnerable people, long and emotionally charged conversations with AI may worsen delusions or psychotic symptoms.",
      "Doctors stress this does not mean chatbots cause psychosis. Instead, growing evidence suggests that AI tools can reinforce distorted beliefs among individuals already at risk. That possibility has prompted new research and clinical warnings from psychiatrists. Some of those concerns have already surfaced in lawsuits alleging that chatbot interactions may have contributed to serious harm during emotionally sensitive situations.",

      "What psychiatrists are seeing in patients using AI chatbots",
      "Psychiatrists describe a repeating pattern. A person shares a belief that does not align with reality. The chatbot accepts that belief and responds as if it were true. Over time, repeated validation can strengthen the belief rather than challenge it.",

      "Clinicians say this feedback loop can deepen delusions in susceptible individuals. In several documented cases, the chatbot became integrated into the person's distorted thinking rather than remaining a neutral tool. Doctors warn that this dynamic raises concern when AI conversations are frequent, emotionally engaging and left unchecked.",
      "Why AI chatbot conversations feel different from past technology",
      "Mental health experts note that chatbots differ from earlier technologies linked to delusional thinking. AI tools respond in real time, remember prior conversations and adopt supportive language. That experience can feel personal and validating.",

      "How AI chatbots can reinforce false or delusional beliefs",
      "Doctors say many reported cases center on delusions rather than hallucinations. These beliefs may involve perceived special insight, hidden truths or personal significance. Chatbots are designed to be cooperative and conversational. They often build on what someone types rather than challenge it. While that design improves engagement, clinicians warn it can be problematic when a belief is false and rigid.",

      "Psychiatrists say some patients report chatbot responses that validate false beliefs, creating a feedback loop that can worsen symptoms over time. (Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "What research and case reports reveal about AI chatbots",
      "Peer-reviewed research and clinical case reports have documented people whose mental health declined during periods of intense chatbot engagement. In some instances, individuals with no prior history of psychosis required hospitalization after developing fixed false beliefs connected to AI conversations. International studies reviewing health records have also identified patients whose chatbot activity coincided with negative mental health outcomes. Researchers emphasize that these findings are early and require further investigation.",
      "A peer-reviewed Special Report published in Psychiatric News titled\u00a0\"AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health\" examined emerging concerns around AI-induced psychosis and cautioned that existing evidence is largely based on isolated cases rather than population-level data. The report states:\u00a0\"To date, these are individual cases or media coverage reports; currently, there are no epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses of the potentially deleterious mental health effects of conversational AI.\"\u00a0The authors emphasize that while reported cases are serious and warrant further investigation, the current evidence base remains preliminary and heavily dependent on anecdotal and nonsystematic reporting.",
      "What AI companies say about mental health risks",
      "OpenAI says it continues working with mental health experts to improve how its systems respond to signs of emotional distress. The company says newer models aim to reduce excessive agreement and encourage real-world support when appropriate. OpenAI has also announced plans to hire a new Head of Preparedness, a role focused on identifying potential harms tied to its AI models and strengthening safeguards around issues ranging from mental health to cybersecurity as those systems grow more capable.",
      "Other chatbot developers have adjusted policies as well, particularly around access for younger audiences, after acknowledging mental health concerns. Companies emphasize that most interactions do not result in harm and that safeguards continue to evolve.",
      "What this means for everyday AI chatbot use",
      "Mental health experts urge caution, not alarm. The vast majority of people who interact with chatbots experience no psychological issues. Still, doctors advise against treating AI as a therapist or emotional authority. Those with a history of psychosis, severe anxiety or prolonged sleep disruption may benefit from limiting emotionally intense AI conversations.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals don't always need malware or exploits to break into systems anymore. Sometimes, they just need the right words in the right place. OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web. This raises uncomfortable questions about how safe these tools really are, especially as they gain more autonomy and access to your data.",

      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "AI-powered browsers can read and act on web content, which also makes them vulnerable to hidden instructions attackers can slip into pages or documents. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why prompt injection isn't going away",
      "In a recent blog post, OpenAI admitted that prompt injection attacks are unlikely to ever be completely eliminated. Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.",
      "OpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that \"agent mode\" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.",
      "OpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.",
      "This isn't just OpenAI's problem. Earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI systems may never be fully mitigated.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "Prompt injection attacks exploit trust at scale, allowing malicious instructions to influence what an AI agent does without the user ever seeing it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The risk trade-off with AI browsers",
      "OpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.",
      "Where OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\" In simple terms, OpenAI trained an AI to act like a hacker. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.",
      "The bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.",
      "Even with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.",

      "As AI browsers gain more autonomy and access to personal data, limiting permissions and keeping human confirmation in the loop becomes critical for safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to reduce risk with AI browsers",
      "You may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.",
      "Only give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.",
      "Never allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.",
      "A password manager ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Telling an AI browser to \"handle whatever is needed\" gives attackers room to manipulate it through hidden prompts. Be specific about what the AI is allowed to do and what it should never do. Narrow instructions make it harder for malicious content to influence the agent.",
      "When an AI browser scans emails, documents or web pages for you, remember that hidden instructions can live inside that content. Treat AI-generated actions as drafts or suggestions, not final decisions. Review anything the AI plans to act on before approving it.",
      "Security fixes for AI browsers evolve quickly as new attack techniques emerge. Delaying updates leaves known weaknesses open longer than necessary. Turning on automatic updates ensures you get protection as soon as they're available, even if you miss the announcement.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There's been a meteoric rise in AI browsers. We're now seeing them from major tech companies, including OpenAI's Atlas, The Browser Company's Dia and Perplexity's Comet. Even existing browsers like Chrome and Edge are pushing hard to add AI and agentic features into their current infrastructure. While these browsers can be useful, the technology is still early. It's best not to fall for the hype and to wait for it to mature.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Researchers highlight the milestone that shows how a robot learned 1,000 real-world tasks in just one day. (Science Robotics)",
      "How robots learned 1,000 physical tasks in one day",
      "A new report published in Science Robotics caught our attention because the results feel genuinely meaningful, impressive and a little unsettling in the best way. The research comes from a team of academic scientists working in robotics and artificial intelligence, and it tackles one of the field's biggest limitations.",
      "The researchers taught a robot to learn 1,000 different physical tasks in a single day using just one demonstration per task. These were not small variations of the same movement. The tasks included placing, folding, inserting, gripping and manipulating everyday objects in the real world. For robotics, that is a big deal.",
      "Why robots have always been slow learners",
      "Until now, teaching robots physical tasks has been painfully inefficient. Even simple actions often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations. Engineers must collect massive datasets and fine-tune systems behind the scenes. That is why most factory robots repeat one motion endlessly and fail as soon as conditions change. Humans learn differently. If someone shows you how to do something once or twice, you can usually figure it out. That gap between human learning and robot learning has held robotics back for decades. This research aims to close that gap.",
      "THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST",
      "The research team behind the study focuses on teaching robots to learn physical tasks faster and with less data. (Science Robotics)",
      "How the robot learned 1,000 tasks so fast",
      "The breakthrough comes from a smarter way of teaching robots to learn from demonstrations. Instead of memorizing entire movements, the system breaks tasks into simpler phases. One phase focuses on aligning with the object, and the other handles the interaction itself. This method relies on artificial intelligence, specifically an AI technique called imitation learning that allows robots to learn physical tasks from human demonstrations.",
      "The robot then reuses knowledge from previous tasks and applies it to new ones. This retrieval-based approach allows the system to generalize rather than start from scratch each time. Using this method, called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer, the researchers trained a real robot arm on 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstration time.",
      "Importantly, this was not done in a simulation. It happened in the real world, with real objects, real mistakes and real constraints. That detail matters.",
      "Why this research feels different",
      "Many robotics papers look impressive on paper but fall apart outside perfect lab conditions. This one stands out because it tested the system through thousands of real-world rollouts. The robot also showed it could handle new object instances it had never seen before. That ability to generalize is what robots have been missing. It is the difference between a machine that repeats and one that adapts.",
      "AI VIDEO TECH FAST-TRACKS HUMANOID ROBOT TRAINING",
      "The robot arm practices everyday movements like gripping, folding and placing objects using a single human demonstration. (Science Robotics)",
      "A long-standing robotics problem may finally be cracking",
      "This research addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics: inefficient learning from demonstrations. By decomposing tasks and reusing knowledge, the system achieved an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional approaches. That kind of leap rarely happens overnight. It suggests that the robot-filled future we have talked about for years may be nearer than it looked even a few years ago.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Faster learning changes everything. If robots need less data and less programming, they become cheaper and more flexible. That opens the door to robots working outside tightly controlled environments.",
      "In the long run, this could enable home robots to learn new tasks from simple demonstrations instead of specialist code. It also has major implications for healthcare, logistics and manufacturing.",
      "More broadly, it signals a shift in artificial intelligence. We are moving away from flashy tricks and toward systems that learn in more human-like ways. Not smarter than people. Just closer to how we actually operate day to day.",

When machines start learning more like humans, the conversation changes. The question shifts from what robots can repeat to what they can adapt to next. That shift is worth paying attention to.",

The alias must contain between 3 and 20 characters.Label: Assign a label for the alias. Aliases are listed alphabetically by their labels.Full Name: Enter the name that will appear in the From field of emails you send using this alias.Click Create to finalize the alias.Once created, any email sent to this alias will be forwarded to your primary iCloud email address. For example, if your primary email is yourname@icloud.com, and you create an alias shopping@icloud.com, any emails sent to shopping@icloud.com will appear in your yourname@icloud.com inbox. This allows you to use different addresses for different purposes while keeping everything in one place.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals have always chased whatever people trust the most. First, it was email. Then search results. Now it's AI chat answers. Researchers are warning about a new campaign where fake AI conversations are showing up in Google search results and quietly pushing Mac users to install dangerous malware. What makes this especially risky is that everything looks helpful, legitimate and step-by-step, right up until your system is compromised.",
      "The malware being spread is Atomic macOS Stealer, often called AMOS, and the attacks abuse conversations generated by tools people increasingly rely on for everyday help. Investigators have confirmed that both ChatGPT and Grok were misused as part of this campaign.",

      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "One copied terminal command is all it takes for malware like AMOS to quietly install itself on a Mac. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How fake AI chat results lead to malware",
      "Researchers traced one infection back to a simple Google search: \"clear disk space on macOS.\" Instead of landing on a normal help article, the user was shown what looked like an AI conversation result embedded directly in search. That conversation offered clear, confident instructions and ended by telling the user to run a command in the macOS Terminal. That command installed AMOS.",
      "When researchers followed the same trail, they found multiple poisoned AI conversations appearing for similar searches. That consistency strongly suggests this was a deliberate operation aimed at Mac users searching for routine maintenance help.",
      "If this feels familiar, it should. A previous campaign used sponsored search results and SEO-poisoned links that pointed to fake macOS software hosted on GitHub. In that case, attackers impersonated legitimate apps and walked users through terminal commands that installed the same AMOS infostealer.",
      "According to researchers, once the terminal command is executed, the infection chain kicks off immediately. The base64 string in the command decodes into a URL that hosts a malicious bash script. That script is designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges and establish persistence, all without triggering a visible security warning.",
      "The danger here is how clean the process looks. There's no installer window, obvious permission prompt or any option for you to review what's about to run. Because everything happens through the command line, normal download protections are sidestepped and the attacker gets to execute whatever they want.",
      "MICROSOFT TYPOSQUATTING SCAM SWAPS LETTERS TO STEAL LOGINS",
      "Fake AI chat results can look polished and trustworthy, even when they are designed to trick you into running harmful commands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so effective?",
      "This campaign combines two powerful ideas. Trust in AI answers and trust in search results. Most major chat tools, including Grok on X, let users delete parts of conversations or share only selected snippets. That means an attacker can carefully curate a short, polished exchange that looks genuinely helpful while hiding the manipulative prompts that produced it.",
      "Using prompt engineering, attackers get ChatGPT to generate a step-by-step cleanup or installation guide that actually installs malware. ChatGPT's sharing feature then creates a public link that lives inside the attacker's account. From there, criminals either pay for sponsored search placement or use SEO tactics to push that shared conversation high in the results.",
      "Some ads are designed to look almost identical to legitimate links. Unless you check who the advertiser actually is, it's easy to assume it's safe. One example documented by researchers showed a sponsored result advertising a fake \"Atlas\" browser for macOS, complete with professional branding.",
      "Once those links are live, attackers don't need to do much else. They wait for users to search, click, trust the AI output and follow the instructions exactly as written.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Attackers rely on trust in search results and AI answers, knowing most people will not question step-by-step instructions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from fake AI chat malware",
      "AI tools are useful, but attackers are now shaping answers that lead you straight into trouble. These steps help you stay protected without giving up search or AI entirely.",
      "This is the most important rule. If an AI response or webpage tells you to open Terminal and paste a command, stop. Legitimate macOS fixes almost never require you to blindly run scripts copied from the internet. Once you press Enter, you lose visibility into what happens next. Malware like AMOS relies on this moment of trust to bypass normal security checks.",
      "AI chats are not authoritative sources. They can be manipulated through prompt engineering to produce dangerous step-by-step guides that look clean and confident. Before acting on any AI-generated fix, cross-check it with Apple's official documentation or a trusted developer site. If you cannot verify it easily, do not run it.",
      "A password manager creates strong, unique passwords for every account you use. If malware steals one password, it cannot unlock everything else. Many password managers also refuse to autofill credentials on fake or unfamiliar sites, which can alert you that something is wrong before you type anything manually. This single tool dramatically reduces the impact of credential-stealing malware.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "AMOS and similar malware often rely on known weaknesses after the initial infection. Updates patch these holes. Delaying updates gives attackers more room to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. Turn on automatic updates so you are protected even if you forget.",
      "Modern macOS malware often runs through scripts and memory-only techniques. A strong antivirus software doesn't just scan files. It monitors behavior, flags suspicious scripts, and can stop malicious activity even when nothing obvious is downloaded. This is especially important when malware is delivered through Terminal commands.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Paid search ads can look almost identical to legitimate results. Always check who the advertiser is before clicking. If a sponsored result leads to an AI conversation, a download or instructions to run commands, close it immediately.",
      "Search results promising quick fixes, disk cleanup or performance boosts are common malware entry points. If a guide is not hosted by Apple or a well-known developer, assume it could be risky, especially if it pushes command-line solutions.",
      "Attackers spend time making fake AI conversations look helpful and professional. Clear formatting and confident language are not signs of safety. They are often part of the deception. Slowing down and questioning the source is usually enough to break the attack chain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This campaign shows how attackers are shifting from breaking systems to manipulating trust. Fake AI conversations work because they sound calm, helpful and authoritative. When those conversations are boosted through search results, they inherit credibility they don't deserve. The technical tricks behind AMOS are complex, but the entry point is simple. Someone follows instructions without questioning where they came from.",

      "Artificial intelligence is quickly reshaping healthcare. It now supports diagnostic imaging, clinical decision tools, patient messages and back office workflows. According to the World Economic Forum, 4.5 billion people still lack access to essential care, and the global health worker shortage could reach 11 million by 2030. AI could help close that gap.",
      "However, as AI becomes more embedded in care, regulators are zeroing in on a simple question. Should patients be told when AI plays a role in their care?",
      "In the United States, no single federal law requires broad AI disclosure in healthcare. Instead, a growing patchwork of state laws is filling that gap. Some states require clear disclosure. Others mandate transparency indirectly through limits on how AI can be used.",

      "Why AI disclosure matters for trust",
      "Transparency is not a technical detail, it is a trust issue. Research across industries shows people expect to be informed when AI affects decisions that matter to them. In healthcare, that expectation is even stronger. An analysis published by CX Today found that when AI use is hidden, trust erodes quickly, even when outcomes are accurate.",
      "Healthcare depends on trust. Patients follow treatment plans, share sensitive information and stay engaged when they believe care decisions are ethical and accountable.",
      "How AI disclosure connects to HIPAA and informed consent",
      "While HIPAA does not directly regulate artificial intelligence, its principles still apply. Covered entities must clearly explain how protected health information is used and safeguarded.",
      "When AI systems analyze or generate clinical information using patient data, nondisclosure can undermine that goal. Patients may not fully understand how their information shapes care decisions.",
      "Disclosure also supports informed consent. Patients have the right to understand material factors influencing diagnosis, treatment, or care communications. Just as clinicians disclose new procedures or medical devices, meaningful AI use should be explained, so patients can ask questions and stay involved in their care.",

      "States are stepping in where federal rules fall short, creating new disclosure requirements when AI influences care access, claims, or treatment decisions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does AI disclosure mean in healthcare?",
      "AI disclosure means informing patients or members when artificial intelligence systems are used in healthcare-related decisions. This can include clinical messages, diagnostic support tools, utilization review, claims processing or coverage determinations. The goal is transparency, accountability and patient trust.",

      "Healthcare organizations that fail to disclose AI use face real consequences. These include increased litigation risk, reputational damage and erosion of patient trust. Ethical concerns around autonomy and transparency can also trigger regulatory scrutiny.",
      "MORE AMERICANS ARE TURNING TO AI FOR HEALTH ADVICE",
      "Clear AI disclosure helps patients stay informed and involved, reinforcing that licensed healthcare professionals remain responsible for every medical decision. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How states are shaping AI disclosure rules",
      "States are taking different paths to regulate healthcare AI, but most are starting with one common goal: greater transparency when technology influences care.",
      "California has taken one of the most comprehensive approaches.",
      "AB 3030 requires clinics and physician offices that use generative AI for patient communications to include a clear disclaimer. Patients must also be told how to reach a human healthcare professional.",
      "SB 1120 applies to health plans and disability insurers. It requires safeguards when AI is used for utilization review. It also mandates disclosure and confirms that licensed professionals make medical necessity decisions.",
      "Colorado's SB24 205 targets AI systems considered high risk. These are tools that materially influence decisions like approval or denial of healthcare services.",
      "Entities must implement safeguards against algorithmic discrimination and disclose AI use. While broader than clinical care alone, the law directly affects patient access decisions.",
      "Utah has layered disclosure rules that intersect with healthcare.",
      "HB 452 requires mental health chatbots to clearly disclose AI use. SB 149 and SB 226 extend disclosure requirements to regulated occupations, including healthcare professionals.",
      "This approach ensures transparency in therapeutic interactions and clinical services.",
      "Other states that are expanding AI transparency",
      "Several other states are moving in the same direction. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee and New York are all considering or enforcing rules that require disclosure and human review when AI influences utilization review or claims outcomes. Even when clinical diagnosis is not covered, these laws push accountability where AI affects care access.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a patient, expect more transparency. You may see disclosures in messages, coverage notices or digital interactions. If you work in healthcare, AI governance is no longer optional. Disclosure practices must align across clinical, administrative, and digital systems. Training staff and updating patient notices will matter as much as the technology itself. Trust will increasingly depend on how openly AI is introduced into care.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI can improve efficiency, expand access, and support clinicians. Yet its value depends on trust. Disclosure does not slow innovation. It strengthens confidence in both the technology and the professionals who use it. As states continue to act, transparency will likely become the norm rather than the exception in healthcare AI.",

      "Why data brokers make it so hard to delete your information",
      "Technically, data brokers have to delete your data if you request it. But here's the part they don't advertise: They want you to give up. Some brokers hide their opt-out pages behind dozens of clicks. Others require you to fax forms, upload IDs, or repeat the request every 30\u201390 days because they\u00a0reactivate your profile without warning.

Shoppers often share email addresses, phone numbers and location data to unlock discounts and faster checkout.",
      "Holiday spending continues to rise year over year. More spending means more data. As a result, your personal information spreads across more databases than at any other time of the year.",
      "After the holiday rush, data brokers update and expand their profiles using newly collected information. January is when many of these companies organize, repackage and resell their datasets.",
      "Starting the removal process early helps limit how widely your information gets shared. Since removals can take days or even weeks, acting now reduces exposure before that data circulates further.",
      "From January through April, scammers ramp up activity tied to tax season. Common threats include\u00a0IRS impersonation scams, fake refund messages and W-2 fraud. Many of these attacks rely on data pulled from broker databases.",
      "When scammers have accurate personal details, their messages feel more convincing. Reducing your data exposure now lowers the risk. Removing your information from major data broker sites is a strong first step. It also helps to check smaller, lesser-known sites that may still list your details.",

      "AMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED",
      "Strong passwords and two-factor authentication stop most account takeovers before they start. (Peter Steffen/picture alliance)",
      "1) Start the year with strong passwords",
      "Passwords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first.",
      "3) Audit your digital presence",
      "Old accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse.",
      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Simple habits like updating software and thinking before you click block common scams. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Keep software and devices up to date",
      "Security updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service",
      "Your personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats.",

      "6) Consider identity theft protection",
      "Identity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads.",

      "Backups, secure Wi-Fi and identity monitoring help limit damage when breaches happen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection",
      "Most cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network",
      "Your Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device.",
      "9) Back up your data regularly",
      "Backups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly.",
      "10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it",
      "A credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright. To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Pro tip: Lock down your email and use aliases",
      "Your email account controls password resets, alerts and account recovery. If attackers get in, they can reach nearly everything else. Secure your primary email with a long, unique password and two-factor authentication. Then create email aliases for shopping, subscriptions and sign-ups. Aliases limit exposure when a company suffers a data breach and make phishing easier to spot. Protecting email this way strengthens every other cybersecurity resolution.",
      "By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A safer digital life starts with small, consistent decisions. Strong passwords, updates, backups and awareness go a long way. By committing to these cybersecurity resolutions, you set yourself up for a more secure 2026. You also make it harder for criminals to profit from stolen data. There is no better time to start than now.",

      "Seattle mayor-elect Katie Wilson defended the fact her parents helped her with money so she could run, arguing it made her 'relatable' to voters during her first interview since beating incumbent mayor Bruce Harrell. (Credit: CNN)",
      "Seattle\u2019s new mayor is facing growing scrutiny over her approach to public safety after an internal police email outlined how most drug possession and public use cases are being directed toward diversion rather than prosecution \u2014 prompting backlash from critics who say the approach sends the wrong message as open drug use remains visible across the city.",
      "The controversy erupted after Seattle Police Chief Shon Barnes circulated an internal message detailing how low-level drug cases will be handled in 2026, fueling concerns among critics that the city is effectively softening enforcement just weeks into Mayor Katie Wilson\u2019s administration. City officials insist there has been no policy change, but critics argue the practical impact tells a different story.",
      "In the internal email obtained by Fox News Digital, Barnes wrote that \"all charges related to drug possession and/or drug use will be diverted from prosecution to the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program,\" citing guidance from the City Attorney\u2019s Office. The directive applies to user-quantity cases, while drug dealers and those ineligible for LEAD remain subject to prosecution.",
      "Barnes emphasized that officers are still expected to arrest individuals when probable cause exists, particularly when drug use occurs in public view.",

      "Seattle Police pushed back on claims that enforcement is changing, telling Fox News Digital that officers will continue to make drug-related arrests and that SPD policy remains unchanged.",
      "The department said prosecutors, not police, determine whether cases move forward, adding that officers can coordinate with prosecutors to pursue traditional prosecution in cases where diversion is deemed ineffective.",
      "SPD also pointed to staffing gains and declining crime rates, noting the department added 165 officers in 2025 and saw reductions in both violent and property crime.",

      "Despite those assurances, critics remain unconvinced.",
      "In an opinion piece published by Seattle Red, conservative radio host and Seattle commentator Jason Rantz argued that diverting most drug use and possession cases away from prosecution undermines accountability, regardless of how city officials describe the policy. Rantz said that when arrests are not followed by prosecution, the message to offenders is that public drug use carries few real consequences.",
      "Criticism has also come from within law enforcement.",

      "Speaking to Rantz on his radio show, Seattle Police Officers Guild President Mike Solan sharply criticized the approach outlined in the internal police email, warning it puts public safety at risk and sends the wrong message about open drug use.",
      "Solan told Rantz that diverting most drug use cases away from prosecution is dangerous and reflects what he described as a na\u00efve political approach to addiction. He warned the strategy could lead to increased crime and overdose deaths, referring to the philosophy behind it as \"suicidal empathy.\"",
      "Solan also said many officers are skeptical of the LEAD program, telling Rantz that some avoid making LEAD referrals altogether because they believe the program is ineffective and driven more by ideology than accountability.",
      "\"The recent naive, ignorant political decision to not arrest offenders for open drug use in the City of Seattle is horrifically dangerous and will create more death and societal decay,\" Solan told Rantz. \"It embodies an enormous flaw in those in our community who think that meeting people where they are who are in the throes of addiction, is the correct path to lift them up.\"",
      "Similar concerns were raised by outreach groups.",

      "City officials, however, maintain that enforcement remains in place.

      "\"We want to know whether our educational institutions, whether our centers of public information, is doing a good job of educating residents and citizens, both local and statewide, about reparations precedents, like the one that happened of course in Evanston or in Rosewood, Florida, and whether our educational institutions are teaching about the principles of international law and where, you know, reparations is enshrined in the right to remedy and repair crimes against humanity.\"",
      "In 2019, Evanston, Illinois, became the first locality to implement reparations in the form of cash payments. Eligible African Americans could receive up to $25,000 in cash payments. As of June, about $6.3 million in reparations had been paid, according to the Evanston RoundTable.",

      "Other parts of Simmons-Thorne's survey quizzed African Americans on the social histories of their families that could \"form the basis of a reparations claim,\" and specifically which Illinois institution would be most culpable for negative social experiences.",
      "Summarizing preliminary data from 61 respondents, she said educators are not doing enough to teach people about the history of reparations precedents, and that survey respondents want financial compensation and \"guarantees of non-repetition\" of slavery as forms of reparation.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:10:31 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump said big oil firms will either \"get reimbursed by us, or through revenue\" if they pay to rebuild Venezuela's oil industry.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said he believes the U.S. oil industry could get expanded operations in Venezuela \"up and running\" in fewer than 18 months.",
      "\"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it\u2019ll be a lot of money,\" Trump told NBC News in an interview Monday.",
      "\"A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they\u2019ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,\" he said.",
      "Whether the U.S. government ultimately agrees to reimburse the oil industry's costs in Venezuela, or alternatively, decides that future revenue is sufficient repayment, will likely be a key factor for the oil companies as they consider their options.",
      "Trump declined to say how much money he believes it would cost companies to repair and upgrade Venezuela's aging oil infrastructure.",
      "\"It\u2019ll be a very substantial amount of money will be spent\" by the oil companies, Trump said. \"But they\u2019ll do very well.\"",
      "\"And the country will do well,\" he added.",
      "Despite Trump's optimism, oil companies have appeared skeptical of quickly entering, expanding or investing in Venezuela. A history of state asset seizures, the ongoing U.S. sanctions and the latest political instability all feed into this caution.",
      "Trump said he believed that tapping Venezuela's oil reserves is \"going to reduce oil prices.\"",
      "Gas prices are already at multiyear lows. The average retail gas price on Monday was $2.81, according to AAA. That's the lowest since March 2021.",
      "\"Having a Venezuela that\u2019s an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down,\" Trump also added.",
      "While lower oil prices could make gas cheaper at the pump, it would likely also mean lower revenues for the same big oil companies that Trump is counting on to bankroll the rebuilding of Venezuela\u2019s oil industry to the tune of billions of dollars in foreign investment.",
      "Asked if the administration had briefed any oil companies ahead of Saturday's military operation to capture deposed Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Trump said, \"No. But we\u2019ve been talking to the concept of, 'what if we did it?'\"",
      "\"The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something,\" Trump said. \"But we didn\u2019t tell them we were going to do it.\"",
      "Trump told NBC News it was \"too soon\" to say whether he had personally spoken to top executives at America\u2019s three largest oil producers, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips.",
      "\"I speak to everybody,\" he said.",
      "ConocoPhillips declined to comment Monday on Trump's plans for Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves. Chevron told NBC News it does not comment \"on commercial matters or speculate on future investments.\" Exxon did not immediately respond to questions.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright plans to meet with executives from Exxon and ConocoPhillips this week about Venezuela\u2019s oil industry, Bloomberg News reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Wright will be a point person for the Trump administration's broader campaign to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure, a White House official said Monday.",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. oil industry is eager to return to Venezuela, nearly two decades after the country last nationalized billions of dollars' worth of oil company assets.",
      "\"They want to go in so badly,\" Trump told reporters Sunday evening.",
      "Despite Venezuela's massive reserves of crude oil, large U.S. oil firms have a good reason to pause before committing to expand operations in Venezuela.",
      "In the 1970s, the Venezuelan government nationalized energy assets there, including those owned by Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. In the years since, the companies have tried unsuccessfully to recover billions of dollars.",
      "In 2006 and 2007, the Venezuelan government nationalized even more assets. Then-President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez allowed foreign oil firms to remain, but on less favorable terms, leading to the full departure of Exxon and Conoco.",
      "Chevron, however accepted the terms and remains to this day, thanks in large part to a limited waiver exempting it from U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil.",
      "Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods recently expressed caution about re-entering Venezuela.",
      "\"We\u2019ve been expropriated from Venezuela two different times,\" he told Bloomberg News in November, replying to a question about whether Exxon would be interested in Venezuela's oil or gas. \"We\u2019d have to see what the economics look like.\""

      "In the wake of the extraordinary U.S. capture of Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the international spotlight has fallen on Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, the country\u2019s interim leader and a key player in an explosive geopolitical drama.",
      "President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that Rodr\u00edguez had been \u201csworn in\u201d as president and stood \u201cwilling to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has sent mixed signals, however, insisting that Maduro remains Venezuela\u2019s \u201conly president,\u201d while also pledging to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with the Trump administration.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s de facto leadership of Venezuela caps a remarkable political ascent for an official who has served in a variety of roles in the governments of both the late socialist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro, who once called her a \u201ctiger\u201d for her vociferous defense of his left-wing authoritarian regime.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Rodr\u00edguez, 56, as Maduro faces a federal indictment in the United States and the immediate fate of Venezuela hangs in the balance.",
      "Revolutionary roots",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas on May 18, 1969. She is the daughter of Marxist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a co-founder of the Socialist League, a militant revolutionary party that was particularly active in the 1970s.",
      "Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez was arrested in connection with his alleged involvement in the 1976 kidnapping of American businessman William F. Niehous. The elder Rodr\u00edguez died in police custody at the age of 34. The saga became a foundational memory for his daughter and one of the raisons d\u2019etre for her political career.",
      "\u201cThe revolution is our revenge for the death of our father and his executioners,\u201d Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was quoted as telling a Venezuelan politician in 2018, referring to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s socialist political program.",
      "She has close political ties with her older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, a psychiatrist by training who serves as president of the National Assembly, the country\u2019s unicameral legislature. He was the country\u2019s vice president under Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013.",
      "Extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9",
      "Rodr\u00edguez is a lawyer by training who graduated from the Central University of Venezuela in 1993. She went on to study labor law in Paris and social sciences in London before she launched her Venezuelan political career in the early 2000s.",
      "She held various low-profile positions in the Ch\u00e1vez regime before she took on a more visible profile as communication and information minister in 2013. Then came the job of foreign minister, from 2014 to 2017, as well as a role heading the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s loyalty to Maduro earned her influence and stature, according to Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. It was the principal reason she was \u201chandpicked\u201d for the vice presidency in June 2018, making her second in the country\u2019s line of succession, Berg said.",
      "\u201cShe has survived in multiple positions because of her ability to exercise power effectively within that regime,\u201d Berg told NBC News.",
      "In a post on social media announcing Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s ascension to the vice presidency, Maduro described her as \u201ca young woman, brave, seasoned, daughter of a martyr, revolutionary and tested in a thousand battles.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Rodr\u00edguez added even more responsibilities to her vice presidential portfolio, taking on roles as finance and oil minister. The latter gave her oversight over Venezuela\u2019s most crucial business sector and coveted export \u2014 and tested her resolve as she attempted to deal with severe U.S. sanctions on the country\u2019s oil industry and the toll of inflation.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez has never faced U.S. criminal charges, though she was sanctioned by the first Trump administration for the role she allegedly played in squashing political dissent in Venezuela.",
      "Uncertainty ahead",
      "It remains to be seen whether Rodr\u00edguez will stay in power, and the rhetoric from the leaders of both Venezuela and the U.S. has fluctuated since Maduro\u2019s stunning capture.",
      "Trump said Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez, describing her as \u201cgracious\u201d and willing to work with the American government as it prosecutes Maduro on narco-terrorism charges in New York.",
      "In a televised address, Rodr\u00edguez struck a more antagonistic tone, reportedly blasting the \u201cextremists\u201d in the Trump administration and insisting that Maduro was Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader despite his capture and indictment by the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cWhat is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "In an Instagram post on Sunday, Rodr\u00edguez used far more diplomatic language, emphasizing the need for a more \u201cbalanced and respectful relationship\u201d between Venezuela and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe extend an invitation to the U.S. government to work together on a cooperation agenda, oriented toward shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez wrote in part.",
      "Trump then presented a stark warning to Rodr\u00edguez, telling a reporter for The Atlantic: \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t do what\u2019s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\u201d",
      "Even if Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s interim role turns into a more permanent position, she will still need to fortify her political standing inside Venezuela and what remains of the Maduro regime, according to Berg.",
      "\u201cShe does not enjoy support from some of the main factions\u201d in Venezuela, Berg said, \u201cand most importantly, she\u2019ll have to consolidate support over the armed forces.\u201d"

      "\"I said, 'You do?' He said, 'Yes.' He goes, 'I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life with you.' And I said, 'I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life with you. We\u2019re getting married!' I said, 'Let\u2019s do it!'\" she recalled.",
      "The author of \"The Let Them Theory\" said her husband didn't waste any time after that.",
      "\"When Chris finally had the ring, he just all of a sudden was like, 'What am I waiting for?'\" she said.",
      "However, getting the ring wasn't easy. Mel Robbins said that Christopher Robbins ran into a little issue once he tried to get her a \"little diamond eternity band\" from a place inside the Empire State Building. Upon checking out, she said he realized that his credit card wasn't working, so he had to ask his brother for money.",
      "Then, there was the challenge of getting in touch with her father to ask for her hand.",
      "\"He can\u2019t reach my dad,\" Mel Robbins said with a laugh. \"And so he leaves a message on the home answering machine.\"",
      "\"Oh my gosh,\" Willie responded.",
      "\u201c'Bob, I hope you don\u2019t mind, but I\u2019m going to ask Mel. I have to do it. I don\u2019t know why,'\" she said, imitating the awkward message.",
      "Once the ring was secured, Mel Robbins said her husband surprised her with a sweet proposal on the roof.",
      "\"I\u2019m sitting here inside. It\u2019s just, like, a random Wednesday. And he walks in, and he said, 'I just got a call from the landlord and there\u2019s something on the roof,'\" she recalled. \"And I\u2019m like, 'OK,' but he said, 'There\u2019s something we\u2019re supposed to go up and look at.' And I\u2019m like, 'Why do I have to?'\"",
      "But once they got to the roof, she was shocked by what her then-future husband did next.",
      "\"He gets down on this disgusting tar, dirty, pigeon-pooped roof and I\u2019m looking around like, 'Why are we up here?' And I\u2019m like, 'What are you doing?' And he\u2019s like, 'Will you marry me?'\" she said. \"And I\u2019m like, 'I thought we were \u2014 Yes!'\"",
      "\"And he had a ring. And that was that,\" she added.",
      "The couple ended up getting married in 1996 in Michigan. They share their three kids, Sawyer, 26, Kendall, 25, and Oakley, 20, together.",
      "Mel Robbins posted a tribute to her husband for their 29th anniversary in August 2025 and shared what they've learned since getting married.",
      "One of her lessons came directly from the theory that sparked her viral hit book: Let them.",
      "\"Stop trying to change people and learn how to love them as they are,\" she said. \"Most fights, resentment and frustration comes from wishing people were different. The more you let people be themselves, the better your relationships will be.\""

      "What Happens to Eleven in the 'Stranger Things' Finale?",

Using their Dungeons and Dragons characters as stand-ins, Mike tells stories about all his friends and what happens to them next.

      "\"For us and our writers, we didn\u2019t want to take her powers away. She represents magic in a lot of ways and the magic of childhood. For our characters to move on and for the story of Hawkins and the Upside Down to come to a close, Eleven had to go away,\" Ross Duffer said.",

      "\"If Eleven is out there, the most that they could hope for is a belief that it\u2019s true because they can\u2019t be in contact with her. Everything falls apart if that were the case. So if that\u2019s the narrative, this is really the best way to keep her alive. And it\u2019s about Mike and everyone finding a way to move past what\u2019s happened,\" Matt Duffer said."

      "Marty Reisman Was a Superstar Table Tennis Player",
      "Reisman was born in February 1930 in New York City, according to his 1974 memoir, \"The Money Player: The Confessions of America's Greatest Table Tennis Champion and Hustler.\"",
      "\"I was a cocky gregarious kid, a bit of a showman and a showoff even then,\" he wrote in his memoir \u2014 qualities he'd have the rest of his life.",
      "His bold personality and undeniably athletic skills helped him to become a legend in the table tennis world. In his biography, he talks about his love for gambling and betting \u2014 on himself.",
      "He won his first championship in 1946, becoming the United States Junior National Champion, a feat he repeated the next year.  He went on to win multiple others, including a United States Doubles Championship in 1949 and a Singles Championship in 1958.",

      "By 13, Reisman had become a city junior champion, often hustling other players for money at Lawrence\u2019s Broadway Table Tennis Club in New York City, reported Forbes. When he was 16, he did a tour of England with a three-man exhibition team, wowing audiences with their paddle skills.",
      "As \"Marty Supreme\" depicts, Reisman worked briefly as a shoe salesman, his only foray into the 9-5 world. For the rest of his life, he relied on his ping-pong skills to make money, he told Forbes.",
      "\"No one has ever been less suited for regular employment than I was,\" he quipped.",

      "Reisman's signature trick, which he showed off during a visit to \"The Late Night Show with David Letterman\" in 2008, was snapping a cigarette in half with a slam.",
      "\"No other player was willing to try it before a large audience. It can be embarrassing to miss four or five times in a row. It is impossible to explain the shot. It involves a communion between the racket, the ball, and the cigarette, and takes a great deal of confidence,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "He Was Obsessed with Being the Best at His Sport",
      "Reisman's goal was to be the best ping-pong player in the world. He talked about his passion for the sport in in his memoir.",
      "His earnings were enough to make him a three-time millionaire, fortunes he repeatedly lost, according to The New York Times.",

      "He Was As Impish As Chalamet's Character",

      "In 1949, Reisman traveled to the English Open where he and fellow American player Dick Miles traded their modest London hotel for swankier accommodations. The pair ran up a tab on room service and other luxuries, charging it all to the English Table Tennis Association, according to his memoir.",
      "When the English officials balked, refusing to pay the bill, Reisman and Miles said they wouldn't participate in their sold-out exhibition matches.",
      "The English officials ended up covering the costs but fined the men $200 and suspended them from sanctioned table tennis worldwide. Reisman wrote the sanction was lifted in 1950.",

Benjamin Markovits\u2019s magnetic prose feels both effortless and precise, as we follow Tom Layward who \u2014 after dropping his daughter off at college \u2014 just keeps driving. Here is a book that will find its home amongst the other great American road trip novels. An absolute triumph.\"",
      "\"On Morrison\" by Namwali Serpell",

      "The European leaders were in Paris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff and others, according to a White House official. It is the latest in frenzied rounds of shuttle diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Though these negotiations have accelerated since November, the U.S. attack on Venezuela and continued suggestions of seizing Greenland have cast a shadow over the talks, which are being held with the very allies that \u2014 under NATO\u2019s principle of collective defense \u2014 Trump has suggested attacking.",
      "\u201cThe Kingdom of Denmark \u2014 including Greenland \u2014 is part of NATO,\u201d the allies said in a joint statement.",
      "\u201cSecurity in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them,\u201d said the statement, issued by the leaders of France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark.",
      "It added that \u201cthe United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally\u201d and through a 1951 defense agreement allowing Washington to build military bases on the vast island. \u201cGreenland belongs to its people,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\u201d",
      "Outgoing centrist Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., called the statement \"embarrassing for the U.S.\" in a post on X.",
      "\"Denigrating our Allies serves no purpose and there is NO up side,\" he said. \"It weakens us by diminishing trust between friends, and Russia and China love it. So\u2026 stop the stupid 'we want Greenland BS.'\"",
      "One of the key elements being discussed in Paris is Ukraine and Europe\u2019s desire for \u201csecurity guarantees,\u201d which could come in the form of a multinational force being deployed to Ukraine to ensure Russia does not launch further attacks.",

      "Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, took this a step further. He told CNN that \"obviously Greenland should be part of the U.S.\" because of what he described as the island's geostrategic importance in helping Washington fulfill its role as \"the power of NATO.\"",
      "\"The real question is, what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?\" he said. \"Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over Greenland,\" Miller added.",

      "President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that Rodr\u00edguez had been \u201csworn in\u201d as president and stood \u201cwilling to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has sent mixed signals, however, insisting that Maduro remains Venezuela\u2019s \u201conly president,\u201d while also pledging to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with the Trump administration.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s de facto leadership of Venezuela caps a remarkable political ascent for an official who has served in a variety of roles in the governments of both the late socialist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro, who once called her a \u201ctiger\u201d for her vociferous defense of his left-wing authoritarian regime.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Rodr\u00edguez, 56, as Maduro faces a federal indictment in the United States and the immediate fate of Venezuela hangs in the balance.",
      "Revolutionary roots",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas on May 18, 1969. She is the daughter of Marxist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a co-founder of the Socialist League, a militant revolutionary party that was particularly active in the 1970s.",
      "Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez was arrested in connection with his alleged involvement in the 1976 kidnapping of American businessman William F. Niehous. The elder Rodr\u00edguez died in police custody at the age of 34. The saga became a foundational memory for his daughter and one of the raisons d\u2019etre for her political career.",
      "\u201cThe revolution is our revenge for the death of our father and his executioners,\u201d Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was quoted as telling a Venezuelan politician in 2018, referring to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s socialist political program.",
      "She has close political ties with her older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, a psychiatrist by training who serves as president of the National Assembly, the country\u2019s unicameral legislature. He was the country\u2019s vice president under Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013.",
      "Extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9",
      "Rodr\u00edguez is a lawyer by training who graduated from the Central University of Venezuela in 1993. She went on to study labor law in Paris and social sciences in London before she launched her Venezuelan political career in the early 2000s.",
      "She held various low-profile positions in the Ch\u00e1vez regime before she took on a more visible profile as communication and information minister in 2013. Then came the job of foreign minister, from 2014 to 2017, as well as a role heading the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s loyalty to Maduro earned her influence and stature, according to Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. It was the principal reason she was \u201chandpicked\u201d for the vice presidency in June 2018, making her second in the country\u2019s line of succession, Berg said.",
      "\u201cShe has survived in multiple positions because of her ability to exercise power effectively within that regime,\u201d Berg told NBC News.",
      "In a post on social media announcing Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s ascension to the vice presidency, Maduro described her as \u201ca young woman, brave, seasoned, daughter of a martyr, revolutionary and tested in a thousand battles.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Rodr\u00edguez added even more responsibilities to her vice presidential portfolio, taking on roles as finance and oil minister. The latter gave her oversight over Venezuela\u2019s most crucial business sector and coveted export \u2014 and tested her resolve as she attempted to deal with severe U.S. sanctions on the country\u2019s oil industry and the toll of inflation.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez has never faced U.S. criminal charges, though she was sanctioned by the first Trump administration for the role she allegedly played in squashing political dissent in Venezuela.",
      "Uncertainty ahead",
      "It remains to be seen whether Rodr\u00edguez will stay in power, and the rhetoric from the leaders of both Venezuela and the U.S. has fluctuated since Maduro\u2019s stunning capture.",
      "Trump said Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez, describing her as \u201cgracious\u201d and willing to work with the American government as it prosecutes Maduro on narco-terrorism charges in New York.",
      "In a televised address, Rodr\u00edguez struck a more antagonistic tone, reportedly blasting the \u201cextremists\u201d in the Trump administration and insisting that Maduro was Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader despite his capture and indictment by the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cWhat is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "In an Instagram post on Sunday, Rodr\u00edguez used far more diplomatic language, emphasizing the need for a more \u201cbalanced and respectful relationship\u201d between Venezuela and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe extend an invitation to the U.S. government to work together on a cooperation agenda, oriented toward shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez wrote in part.",
      "Trump then presented a stark warning to Rodr\u00edguez, telling a reporter for The Atlantic: \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t do what\u2019s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\u201d",
      "Even if Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s interim role turns into a more permanent position, she will still need to fortify her political standing inside Venezuela and what remains of the Maduro regime, according to Berg.",
      "\u201cShe does not enjoy support from some of the main factions\u201d in Venezuela, Berg said, \u201cand most importantly, she\u2019ll have to consolidate support over the armed forces.\u201d"

It has expressed support for Venezuela in recent months amid President Donald Trump\u2019s military buildup, though it has no security commitments to the country and experts say it has avoided more concrete action in part to preserve the U.S.-China trade truce.",

      "In a caption accompanying photos and videos posted on his Instagram account, Maduro described the meeting as \u201ca fraternal encounter that reaffirms the strong ties of brotherhood and friendship between China and Venezuela.\u201d",
      "China, which is already South America\u2019s top trading partner, is seeking to expand its influence in the region, even as Trump has put it at the center of his national security agenda. Though Beijing has emphasized economic ties and nonintervention in its approach to Latin America, there was a greater focus on military and law enforcement cooperation in the policy paper it released last month.",

      "The U.S. attack on Venezuela has also raised fears that it could embolden China to move against Taiwan, the self-ruling island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory and has vowed to bring under its control, by force if necessary.",

      "President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that Rodr\u00edguez had been \u201csworn in\u201d as president and stood \u201cwilling to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has sent mixed signals, however, insisting that Maduro remains Venezuela\u2019s \u201conly president,\u201d while also pledging to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with the Trump administration.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s de facto leadership of Venezuela caps a remarkable political ascent for an official who has served in a variety of roles in the governments of both the late socialist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro, who once called her a \u201ctiger\u201d for her vociferous defense of his left-wing authoritarian regime.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Rodr\u00edguez, 56, as Maduro faces a federal indictment in the United States and the immediate fate of Venezuela hangs in the balance.",
      "Revolutionary roots",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas on May 18, 1969. She is the daughter of Marxist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a co-founder of the Socialist League, a militant revolutionary party that was particularly active in the 1970s.",
      "Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez was arrested in connection with his alleged involvement in the 1976 kidnapping of American businessman William F. Niehous. The elder Rodr\u00edguez died in police custody at the age of 34. The saga became a foundational memory for his daughter and one of the raisons d\u2019etre for her political career.",
      "\u201cThe revolution is our revenge for the death of our father and his executioners,\u201d Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was quoted as telling a Venezuelan politician in 2018, referring to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s socialist political program.",
      "She has close political ties with her older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, a psychiatrist by training who serves as president of the National Assembly, the country\u2019s unicameral legislature. He was the country\u2019s vice president under Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013.",
      "Extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9",
      "Rodr\u00edguez is a lawyer by training who graduated from the Central University of Venezuela in 1993. She went on to study labor law in Paris and social sciences in London before she launched her Venezuelan political career in the early 2000s.",
      "She held various low-profile positions in the Ch\u00e1vez regime before she took on a more visible profile as communication and information minister in 2013. Then came the job of foreign minister, from 2014 to 2017, as well as a role heading the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s loyalty to Maduro earned her influence and stature, according to Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. It was the principal reason she was \u201chandpicked\u201d for the vice presidency in June 2018, making her second in the country\u2019s line of succession, Berg said.",
      "\u201cShe has survived in multiple positions because of her ability to exercise power effectively within that regime,\u201d Berg told NBC News.",
      "In a post on social media announcing Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s ascension to the vice presidency, Maduro described her as \u201ca young woman, brave, seasoned, daughter of a martyr, revolutionary and tested in a thousand battles.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Rodr\u00edguez added even more responsibilities to her vice presidential portfolio, taking on roles as finance and oil minister. The latter gave her oversight over Venezuela\u2019s most crucial business sector and coveted export \u2014 and tested her resolve as she attempted to deal with severe U.S. sanctions on the country\u2019s oil industry and the toll of inflation.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez has never faced U.S. criminal charges, though she was sanctioned by the first Trump administration for the role she allegedly played in squashing political dissent in Venezuela.",
      "Uncertainty ahead",
      "It remains to be seen whether Rodr\u00edguez will stay in power, and the rhetoric from the leaders of both Venezuela and the U.S. has fluctuated since Maduro\u2019s stunning capture.",
      "Trump said Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez, describing her as \u201cgracious\u201d and willing to work with the American government as it prosecutes Maduro on narco-terrorism charges in New York.",
      "In a televised address, Rodr\u00edguez struck a more antagonistic tone, reportedly blasting the \u201cextremists\u201d in the Trump administration and insisting that Maduro was Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader despite his capture and indictment by the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cWhat is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "In an Instagram post on Sunday, Rodr\u00edguez used far more diplomatic language, emphasizing the need for a more \u201cbalanced and respectful relationship\u201d between Venezuela and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe extend an invitation to the U.S. government to work together on a cooperation agenda, oriented toward shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez wrote in part.",
      "Trump then presented a stark warning to Rodr\u00edguez, telling a reporter for The Atlantic: \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t do what\u2019s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\u201d",
      "Even if Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s interim role turns into a more permanent position, she will still need to fortify her political standing inside Venezuela and what remains of the Maduro regime, according to Berg.",
      "\u201cShe does not enjoy support from some of the main factions\u201d in Venezuela, Berg said, \u201cand most importantly, she\u2019ll have to consolidate support over the armed forces.\u201d"

      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro.\u201d",
      "Follow live updates",
      "Rubio\u2019s latest remarks come after he and President Donald Trump signaled at a news conference Saturday that the administration could begin targeting Cuba\u2019s government next, with the secretary of state issuing a stern warning to Cuban officials: \u201cIf I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I\u2019d be concerned.\u201d",

      "Trump on Saturday compared Cuba\u2019s situation to that of Venezuela, telling reporters, \u201cI think Cuba is going to be something we\u2019ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now, a very badly failing nation, and we want to help the people.\u201d",
      "The president added, \u201cIt\u2019s very similar [to Venezuela] in the sense that we want to help the people in Cuba, but we want to also help the people that were forced out of Cuba and are living in this country.\u201d",
      "Rubio added on Sunday that Cuban officials were with Maduro in Venezuela ahead of his capture.",
      "\u201cIt was Cubans that guarded Maduro,\u201d the secretary of state told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker. \u201cHe was not guarded by Venezuelan bodyguards. He had Cuban bodyguards.\u201d",
      "Rubio added that Cuban bodyguards were also in charge of \u201cinternal intelligence\u201d in Maduro\u2019s government, including \u201cwho spies on who inside to make sure there are no traitors.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose are all Cubans,\u201d the secretary of state said.",
      "Trump on Saturday also spoke about his outlook on foreign policy in Latin America, referring to the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, a policy by which the U.S. sought to shape the Western Hemisphere and defend the Americas against influence from European powers.",
      "Pointing to China, Iran and Russia\u2019s influence on the oil industry in Venezuela, the president said, \u201cAll of these actions were in gross violation of the core principles of American foreign policy, dating back more than two centuries.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cAll the way back, dated to the Monroe doctrines. And the Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we\u2019ve superseded it by a lot, by a real lot. They now call it the Donroe doctrine.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, Trump took jabs at other Latin American presidents, like Gustavo Petro of Colombia and Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico.",
      "Trump, during the news conference Saturday, accused Petro of having \"cocaine mills\" and reiterated that he should \"watch his ass.\"",
      "\"He has cocaine mills. He has factories where he makes cocaine. And yeah, I think I stick by my first statement. He\u2019s making cocaine. They\u2019re sending it into the United States. So he does have to watch his ass,\" the Trump said Saturday.",
      "And in an interview Saturday morning with Fox News, Trump accused Sheinbaum of allowing drug cartels to operate in her country, saying, \"Something is going to have to be done with Mexico.\"",
      "On Saturday, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel denounced the United States\u2019 attacks on Venezuela and the capture of Maduro, calling them an act of \u201cstate terrorism.\u201d",
      "\u201c#Cuba denounces and urgently demands the reaction of the international community against the criminal attack by the U.S. on #Venezuela. Our #ZonaDePaz [Zone of Peace] is being brutally assaulted. State terrorism against the brave Venezuelan people and against Our America,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "And an official statement from the Cuban government said it \u201cstrongly condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the military aggression carried out by the United States against Venezuela, while categorically reaffirming Cuba\u2019s absolute support and solidarity with the sister Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and its government.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis cowardly U.S. aggression constitutes a criminal act and a violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. It represents a dangerous escalation of the sustained campaign of war waged for years by the United States against that sister nation,\u201d the statement added. \u201cAll nations of the region must remain alert, as the threat hangs over all. In Cuba, our determination to struggle is firm and unwavering. The decision is one and only one: Homeland or Death.\u201d",
      "Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants to the U.S., has long been a Cuba hawk and has for years pursued regime change in Cuba and Venezuela.",
      "In 2019, during his first term, Trump was vocally supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who at one point declared himself president of Venezuela, a move that was recognized by the U.S. and dozens of other countries. Guaido was later targeted by Maduro with criminal charges.",
      "During a 2019 pro-Guaido uprising, Rubio, then a senator from Florida, told NPR that he believed there was a legal justification for the U.S. to use military force in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has a right to use military force\u201d when there is a threat to U.S. interests or national security, Rubio told the public radio station, and \u201cby and large, that applies to Venezuela.\u201d",
      "He added that the United States\u2019 targeting of Maduro in Venezuela could have an additional benefit of destabilizing Cuba.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a byproduct of our engagement, but it most certainly is not the central rationale for it,\u201d Rubio said at the time.",
      "In that 2019 interview, he also referenced Cuba\u2019s support for Maduro with security and espionage services, saying that toppling Maduro would affect the income Cuba\u2019s government makes from those services.",
      "\u201cThey make a billion dollars a year \u2014 over a billion dollars a year that they\u2019re paid for their security and espionage services. So the loss of a billion dollars will absolutely have an impact on that regime and something that I would welcome. Anything that\u2019s bad for a communist dictatorship is something I support,\u201d Rubio said."

      "In a private phone call a week ago, Trump told Nicol\u00e1s Maduro that he had to go.",
      "By that point, an armada of U.S. warships was floating off Venezuela\u2019s shores. A CIA team had crept into the country, tracking Maduro\u2019s movements and habits: where he slept, what he ate, where he traveled.",
      "\u201cYou got to surrender,\u201d Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home.",
      "Maduro took the gamble of his life. He \u201ccame close\u201d to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",
      "As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing \u201cextraordinary insight\u201d into Maduro\u2019s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",
      "Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News \u2014 the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",
      "The same month, America\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, swept into the Caribbean, part of a military buildup that Trump believed got the attention of Maduro.",
      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",
      "At a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026.",
      "\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d he said.",
      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",
      "In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he\u2019ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business.",
      "\u201cThe Donroe Doctrine,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "The U.S. isn\u2019t leaving Venezuela soon, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to run it essentially until such time as a proper transition can take place.\u201d",
      "Looking back at his fateful phone call with Maduro, Trump suggested at the news conference that Maduro had chosen poorly in not heeding his command.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Trump said, \u201che wished he did.\u201d"

      "The injured were teenagers and young adults, roughly 20 years old on average, he told The Associated Press inside the hospital.",
      "Injured survivors suffered burns to varying degrees, not just to their skin but also to their airways.",
      "\u201cThere were inhalations of both smoke and also of heat that for some probably led to internal burns. That\u2019s a really catastrophic situation, as you can imagine,\u201d Bonvin said.",
      "\u201cIt was hard to live through for everyone. Also probably because everyone was asking themselves, \u2018Was my child, my cousin, someone from the region at this party?\u2019 This place was very well known as somewhere to celebrate the new year,\u201d Bonvin said. \u201cAlso, seeing young people arrive \u2014 that\u2019s always traumatic.\u201d",
      "The road to recovery for the gravely injured will likely be long and arduous, he cautioned.",
      "\u201cFor those with serious burns, intensive care treatment lasts several months,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s not without hope,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are young, and that means they still have a lot of vitality.\u201d",

      "The Artemis II mission, the next step in NASA\u2019s return-to-the-moon program, is expected to launch sometime from February to April. The flight will be a key test of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The mission will send four astronauts on a roughly 10-day journey around the moon to evaluate how the Orion spacecraft\u2019s various systems and hardware function in a deep space environment.",
      "The mission will be the first crewed flight of the Artemis program, and it will take the astronauts to the closest point humans have come to the moon in more than 50 years, since the end of the Apollo program.",
      "It will be closely watched, particularly as the Trump administration has repeatedly talked about the need to return to the moon before China lands its astronauts on the lunar surface. Much of that vision hinges on the outcome of the Artemis II mission.",
      "If it succeeds, the flight will pave the way for the Artemis III mission, which is expected to land astronauts near the moon\u2019s south pole. In a recent executive order, President Donald Trump directed NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 \u201cto assert American leadership in space, lay the foundations for lunar economic development, prepare for the journey to Mars, and inspire the next generation of American explorers.\u201d",

The GOP\u2019s defense of its Senate majority is likely to be easier, as Democrats need to net four more seats there, and most of that battlefield runs through states Trump won in 2024.",

    "story": [
      "Widespread protests have rocked Iran for more than a week and led to increasing violent clashes with security forces, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten intervention if a crackdown continues.",
      "The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country\u2019s leaders about how much support they really enjoy.",
      "Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\u201d He did not specify what this would mean.",
      "Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities.",
      "Last week, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to \u201cknock the hell out of\u201d Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program.",
      "Saturday\u2019s capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran\u2019s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as \u201ca clear example of state terrorism.\u201d But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year.",
      "\u201cIranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive feelings,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn\u2019t willing to reform or change,\u201d Vakil said,",
      "Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran\u2019s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say.",
      "The country\u2019s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country\u2019s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems.",
      "\u201cIf the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don\u2019t look for America or someone else to blame,\u201d Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. \u201cWe need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.\u201d",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian\u2019s powers in dealing with the protests.",
      "\u201cHe is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,\u201d Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime\u2019s inherent corruption and incapacity,\u201d Milani said. \u201cThey want the regime changed.\u201d",
      "Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests, including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump\u2019s threats of intervention will encourage the protesters or lead security forces to hold their fire.",
      "\u201cPeople could feel slightly more confident and emboldened thinking that the United States might actually be more than rhetorically supportive,\u201d said Vakil of Chatham House. \u201cBut I worry that they might be disappointed, not understanding that the United States is very much focused on outcomes and interests that benefit the United States and not really benevolent towards the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "Still, whether the protests expand and continue or are crushed by force like similar protests in 2022 and 2023 \u2014 when approximately 500 people were killed and thousands were arrested \u2014 will largely depend on the will of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThey will have a scorched-earth policy,\u201d Milani from Stanford said."

      "Venezuela will not have new elections in the next 30 days, President Donald Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Monday, projecting a longer-term engagement two days after U.S. forces captured that nation's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"We have to fix the country first. You can\u2019t have an election. There\u2019s no way the people could even vote,\" Trump said about the possibility of a vote in the next month. \"No, it\u2019s going to take a period of time. We have \u2014 we have to nurse the country back to health.\"",
      "Moreover, he said, the U.S. may subsidize an effort by oil companies to rebuild the country's energy infrastructure \u2014 a project he said could take less than 18 months.",
      "\"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money,\" he said. \"A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they\u2019ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.\"",
      "He also insisted the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela.",
      "\"No, we\u2019re not,\" Trump said. \"We\u2019re at war with people that sell drugs. We\u2019re at war with people that empty their prisons into our country and empty their drug addicts and empty their mental institutions into our country.\"",
      "In the roughly 20-minute interview, Trump identified a group of U.S. officials \u2014 including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 who will help oversee America\u2019s involvement in Venezuela.",
      "\"It's a group of all. They have all expertise, different expertise,\" he said.",
      "But he had a one-word answer for who is ultimately in charge: \u201cMe.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s discussion of his vision for Venezuela came just a couple of hours after Maduro was arraigned in New York on a series of charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy. He was seized from a compound in the capital city of Caracas in the wee hours of Saturday morning during a raid by U.S. special forces and law enforcement officials.",
      "Maduro pleaded not guilty, saying he remains the leader of his country even as Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in Monday as his successor.",
      "Trump said Rodr\u00edguez has been cooperating with U.S. officials but insisted there was no communication between her camp and the American side before Maduro's ouster.",
      "\"No, that\u2019s not the case,\" he said, adding that a determination will be made soon about whether existing sanctions against Rodr\u00edguez will be left in place or lifted.",
      "When asked if there was \"any deal with any official in Venezuela to remove\" Maduro, Trump replied, \"Well, yeah, because a lot of people wanted to make a deal, but we decided to do it this way,\" adding that it was without the help of Maduro's inner circle.",
      "Trump also declined to say whether he's spoken to Rodr\u00edguez yet, but he said that Rubio \"speaks to her fluently in Spanish\" and that their \"relationship has been very strong.\"",
      "He indicated that the U.S. could launch a second military incursion into Venezuela if Rodr\u00edguez stops cooperating with U.S. officials but said he does not believe that will be necessary. Trump also suggested he had initially expected to have to send in American forces again already.",
      "\"We\u2019re prepared to do it,\" he said. \"We anticipated doing it, actually.\"",
      "Trump also denied a Washington Post report that he had dismissed the possibility of Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado running the country because she won the Nobel Peace Prize last year \u2014 an award long sought by Trump.",
      "\"She should not have won it,\" he said. \"But no, that has nothing to do with my decision.\"",
      "Having campaigned on an \"America First\" platform and his desire to end wars, rather than start them, Trump has seen some of his political allies question the wisdom of the U.S. entering into a long-term commitment in Venezuela.",
      "But he said in the interview that he is confident his political base will stick with him.",
      "\"MAGA loves it. MAGA loves what I\u2019m doing. MAGA loves everything I do,\" Trump said. \"MAGA is me. MAGA loves everything I do, and I love everything I do, too.\"",
      "Critics in both parties have noted that Trump did not seek a new authorization from Congress to launch Saturday morning's raid, and he said in the interview that he would not need lawmakers to act in order for him to send American troops back in.",
      "\"We have good support congressionally,\" he said. \"And Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn't they support us?\"",
      "When asked what Congress \"knew\" \u2014 and whether any lawmakers had advance notification about the operation \u2014 Trump declined to elaborate.",
      "\"I don't want to get into that,\" he replied, \"but people knew.\""

      "Copenhagen may be 5,200 miles away from Caracas, but the thrum of the helicopters that grabbed Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro will have been deafening in the Danish capital.",
      "Trump\u2019s longtime threats to seize Denmark\u2019s territory of Greenland have been widely derided in Europe, mocked even, as outlandish talk that could surely never translate into the United States effectively invading a NATO ally.",
      "But Trump's willingness and ability to capture Maduro \u2014 and his suggestion that Greenland and its own vast natural resources may be next \u2014 have raised worries that there may be more to this Arctic ambition.",
      "It has triggered the strongest protests yet against Washington\u2019s hostile overtures, including from longtime U.S. allies in Europe.",
      "\u201cNo more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation,\u201d Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post Sunday.",
      "\u201cWhen the president of the United States talks about \u2018we need Greenland\u2019 and connects us with Venezuela and military intervention, it\u2019s not just wrong.

      "Trump and his team have for months said they want to take over the vast semi-autonomous Danish territory, citing its strategic importance and mineral wealth.

However, the U.S. is by far the biggest contributor to NATO and has historically been seen as the ultimate guarantor behind its pledge of mutual self-defense.",
      "Germany indicated Monday that European allies would be prepared to step in.",
      "\u201cSince Denmark is a member of NATO, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to NATO defense,\u201d Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told reporters in Lithuania. \u201cAnd if there are further requirements to strengthen defense efforts concerning Greenland, then we will have to discuss this within the framework of the alliance.\u201d"

      "\"The country is a mess. It's been horribly run. The oil is just flowing at a very low level,\" Trump said. \"So we're going to have the big oil companies go in, and they're going to fix the infrastructure. They're going to invest money. We're not going to invest anything. We're going to just take care of the country. We're going to cherish the country. We're going to take care, more importantly, of the people, including Venezuelans.\"",

      "Backdraft is when new air comes into contact with a fire that has used up all the available oxygen. This can lead \"to immediate fatal injuries, including severe blast trauma, extensive thermal damage, and lethal inhalation of toxic gases,\" Larribau said, \"and is therefore more commonly observed among nonsurvivors rather than among rescued victims.\"",
      "Flashover occurs when all flammable materials in an enclosed space ignite simultaneously, causing \"severe, often deep, burns predominantly affecting exposed body areas such as the face, neck, and upper limbs, and is frequently associated with critical inhalation injury due to intense radiant heat and superheated gases,\" he said.",
      "\"For those who survive, there will be weeks or even months of rehabilitation, and many will suffer lifelong consequences,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Russia rang in the new year by launching more than 200 drones at Ukraine, while President Vladimir Putin used his year-end address to rally support for his troops and to assure his nation of victory.",
      "In Ukraine itself, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Dec. 31 address was defiant but also optimistic about the frenetic shuttle diplomacy being brokered by the United States.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russia, whose officials are also in talks with the Americans, remains the central barrier to peace, with Putin unyielding in his maximalist demands.",
      "\u201cI would give anything in the world if, in this address, I could say that peace will also come in just a few minutes,\u201d Zelenskyy said just before the clock struck midnight. \u201cUnfortunately, I cannot say that yet. But with a clear conscience, I \u2014 all of us \u2014 can say that Ukraine is truly doing everything for peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader recently returned from a meeting with President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday. Afterward, Zelenskyy said Trump had offered 15 years of the crucial \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d that he says are essential to stop Putin from attacking again. Ukraine had asked for 50 years, he said.",
      "Hours before the new year\u2019s bells chimed, Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff posted on X that he had held a call with Zelenskyy, Ukrainian national security secretary Rustem Umerov and the national security advisers of Britain, France and Germany.",
      "In his own post on X, Umerov said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner were also on the call.",
      "Though Zelenskyy said that the \u201cpeace agreement is 90% ready,\u201d he suggested that the remaining 10% contained the thorniest issues preventing peace.",
      "\u201cThose are the 10% that will determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live,\u201d he said. \u201cTen percent to save millions of lives. Ten percent of the determination needed for peace to work 100%. Ten percent of the unity and wisdom so desperately needed \u2014 Ukrainian, American, European, from the entire world. Ten percent to peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader charted what has been a roller-coaster year trying to retain the goodwill of Trump, a pivotal and changeable figure in the peace process. Zelenskyy said \u201cit was not easy at all to achieve such a change in the tone of relations between Ukraine and the United States\u201d after he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance in an extraordinary White House meeting in February.",
      "Trump has often shifted between appearing to favor Russia and then Ukraine during these negotiations, and has at various points been criticized for freezing Ukraine and Europe out of the process.",
      "\u201cWithout Ukraine, nothing will work. Ukraine has defended its right to have a voice,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding later: \u201cUkraine is, in fact, the only shield that now separates Europe\u2019s comfortable way of life from the Russian world.\u201d",
      "Hours after Zelenskyy spoke, Russia launched 205 drones \u2014 mostly Iran-designed Shaheds along with some Russian Gerbera drones \u2014 into Ukraine, according to the country\u2019s military. Air defense systems downed 176 of these, but 24 strikes were recorded at 15 locations, it said. There was also shelling right along the line of contact between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "At least two people were killed and more than a dozen injured across the country, according to regional officials.",
      "For its part, Ukraine launched a strike against Russia\u2019s Rosrezerv oil depot in the Yaroslavl region, the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said in a statement. The SBU said this was the latest strike designed to \u201ccut off the supply chains of Russian petroleum products with surgical precision, both abroad and for the troops attacking Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Russia claimed this week that Ukraine had attempted to assassinate Putin with a drone strike on his country residence, something that Ukraine denied and the CIA concluded was not true, a source with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "In his own New Year\u2019s address, Putin said his country was striving \u201cto bring joy and warmth\u201d to those in need, as well as the \u201cheroes\u201d fighting in Ukraine. \u201cI wish all our soldiers and commanders a happy new year! We believe in you and in our victory,\u201d he said.",
