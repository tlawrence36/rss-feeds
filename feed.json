      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens.\u201d",
      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens,\u201d organizers announced Tuesday.",
      "Liu, based in Chengdu in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan region, has said that the purpose of his architecture \u201cis to create a beautiful, just and dignified living environment,\u201d and that he tries to balance commercial needs with the human needs of the public.",
      "The architect \u201cupholds the transcendent power of the built environment through the harmonizing of cultural, historical, emotional and social dimensions, using architecture to forge community, inspire compassion and elevate the human spirit,\u201d Pritzker organizers said in a statement.",
      "Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, \u201cforging a positive relationship between density and open space,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Organizers cited his West Village in Chengdu, a 2015 five-story project that spans a block. It includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around \u201cits own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.\u201d",
      "They also noted the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute Department of Sculpture in Chongqing, which they said displays an alternate solution to maximizing space, \u201cwith upper levels protruding outward to extend the square footage of a narrow footprint.\u201d",
      "In an interview Sunday in his office in Chengdu, Liu said he was not one of those architects who likes to have a strongly recognizable visual style. Rather, he said, he pays more attention to method and strategy.",
      "\u201cMany architects use a strong personal style and form to gain a foothold in the world,\u201d Liu told The Associated Press, speaking in Mandarin. \u201cNo matter where it is, people can tell immediately that it is his or her work with a very strong symbolism. But I am not such a kind of architect.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a very clear or obvious style that can be recognized as mine just at a glance,\u201d he said. \u201cI take a more methodological and strategic approach. I hope that when I go to a specific place, I can use my methodology and strategy to adapt to local conditions. I like to fully understand the place, and then look for resources, problems \u2026 and then distill and refine, and finally turn (this) into my work.\u201d",
      "Liu also said he tries to balance his country\u2019s artistic and architectural heritage with the realities of modern technology.",
      "\u201cI think China\u2019s traditional architecture is of course brilliant and very classic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is a product of its time.\u201d",
      "He said he hopes to deeply understand \u201cthe thematic part of tradition that can survive,\u201d and then express it with contemporary technology and language. In that way, he said, \u201ctradition can be used as a core \u2026 but the presentation of your work is contemporary.\u201d",
      "Liu said he also seeks to balance commercial imperatives with civic concerns.",
      "\u201cThe rapid development of cities nowadays is basically driven by capital. It is natural for capital to pursue profits,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cYou have to leave the public the space they deserve. Only in this way can the development of a city be positive and healthy, rather than being completely high-density, where people live in drawers and boxes \u2026 without even a place to go and no space for communication.\u201d",
      "Liu is the 54th laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, established in 1979 by the late entrepreneur Jay A. Pritzker and his wife, Cindy. Winners receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion.",
      "The prize has often been equated to the Nobel. Asked if he thought the honor would impact his life, Liu replied: \u201cI have thought about it. But I want to maintain normalcy \u2026 I don\u2019t want to become nervous about everything. Of course, it has its advantages. I will definitely not need to promote myself too much. But will it also make me better at work? Not necessarily. Excessive expectations may become a pressure.\u201d",
      "He had another concern, too.",
      "\u201cAnd will it make me too busy and prevent me from working more attentively?\u201d he pondered. \u201cI hope to keep the normalcy and the freedom, as well as calmness.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "When he was 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France",
      "AMSTERDAM -- When he was just 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France.",
      "Now, more than half a century later, the museum named for the Dutch master is joining forces for the first time with the neighboring Stedelijk modern and contemporary art museum in Amsterdam to stage a blockbuster exhibition of Kiefer's work, titled \u201cSag mir wo die Blumen sind,\u201d a reference to folk singer Pete Seeger's iconic pacifist anthem \u201cWhere have all the flowers gone?\u201d",
      "Kiefer said he did not set out to make an exclusively anti-war exhibition, even though he closely follows world events including the conflict triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t say \u2018I do now an exhibition against the war.\u2019 This I don\u2019t do because this is a program; I\u2019m not a programmatic artist,\" he said. \"I do what is in me, what has to come out. And that is about all kinds of things, about the dead, about the war.\u201d",
      "Kiefer's sometimes bleak work, rooted in growing up in post-World War II Germany, might not immediately feel closely related to Van Gogh's vibrant and richly colored landscapes and vases of sunflowers.",
      "But take a look at Kiefer's 2019 \u201cThe Crows,\u201d alongside Van Gogh's 1890 \u201cWheatfield with Crows,\u201d and the inspiration for the German's work jumps from the wall.",
      "The brooding black birds aren't the only shared subjects that the two artists depict.",
      "One of Van Gogh's most famous inspirations \u2014 sunflowers \u2014 also appear in Kiefer's works.",
      "A huge dried sunflower hangs upside down in a glass cabinet, shedding its seeds on a book made from lead sheets, while \u201cSol Invictus\u201d shows a sunflower towering over the artist, who is lying in a yoga position known as the corpse pose.",
      "The show also includes some of his sketches from his trip retracing Van Gogh's footsteps.",
      "The 79-year-old German artist has a long relationship not just with Van Gogh, but also with the Stedelijk and Dutch collectors who bought some of his early works. The Stedelijk is showing early pieces such as a sculpture of an aeroplane resembling a B-1 bomber that is made of lead and called \u201cJourney to the end of the Night.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of the Stedelijk is the installation for which the show is named. Built up around the museum's central staircase, it features paint-splattered clothes on hangers and flower petals spilling down paintings and into piles on the floor, among many things.",
      "Kiefer said that he wrote one of the lines in the Seeger song, which was later also sung in German by Marlene Dietrich, on the wall as part of the installation: \u201cWho will ever learn?\u201d",
      "\"This sentence makes the song philosophical,\" he told reporters. \"You know, because we cannot understand. We cannot understand, for example, that today things happened in (19)33 in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked about the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party that surged in last month's German election, he said: \u201cIt's horrible.\u201d",
      "The huge central work is made up of a long list of components including emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, golf leaf, sediment of electrolysis, dried flowers, straw, fabric and steel.",
      "The straw features in many of Kiefer\u2019s paintings, giving them a complex surface that sometimes echoes Van Gogh\u2019s bold brush strokes.",
      "\"He\u2019s working like a sort of ... alchemist transforming material into an art,\u201d curator Edwin Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum told The Associated Press.",
      "The exhibition opens March 7 and runs until June 9 at the Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum."

    "story": [
      "George Clooney, the proud son of a journalist, likes journalism and telling truth to power",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 George Clooney made waves in July when he called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing diminished capacity. For Clooney, there wasn't a choice to stay silent.",
      "\u201cI was raised to tell the truth and telling the truth means telling it when it's not comfortable,\" the actor-director and big Democratic booster tells The Associated Press. \u201cI did what I was raised and taught to do. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "There was inevitable backlash \u2014 just as there was back when he was branded a traitor for speaking out against the invasion of Iraq \u2014 but Clooney took the hits.",
      "\u201cTelling the truth to power or taking chances like that \u2014we\u2019ve seen it over our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here and survived these things and we will survive it.\u201d",
      "Clooney's truth-to-power stance takes another step this spring as he makes his Broadway debut, telling the story of legendary reporter Edward R. Murrow in an adaptation of his 2005 film \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d Performances starts March 12.",
      "Murrow, who died in 1965, is considered one of the architects of U.S. broadcast news and perhaps his greatest moment was opposing Sen. Joe McCarthy, who cynically created paranoia of a communist threat in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about who we are at our best, when we hold our own feet to the fire, when we check and balance ourselves,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary about now and the difference between Murrow\u2019s time is that we\u2019ve now decided that truth is negotiable.\u201d",
      "In the movie version \u2014 which Clooney co-wrote with Grant Heslov \u2014 the role of Murrow went to David Strathairn and Clooney played CBS executive Fred Friendly; this time, Clooney takes up the mantle of Murrow. When he and Heslov did a reading for theater investors he just played Murrow and the financiers agreed to sink their money in the play \u2014 on the condition Clooney stay in the role.",
      "As in the movie, the play version will have footage of the real McCarthy on screens and the stage will resemble a newsroom with several dozen old-fashioned monitors mixing old and new footage.",
      "The transition to Broadway makes a lot of sense since many of the movie's reviewers said it felt to them a lot like a play. It actually was originally conceived as a live TV movie, an idea scuttled after Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show and scared away any notion of live network events.",
      "\u201cIt is an incredibly literary play,\u201d says Tony-winning director David Cromer. \u201cIt is filled with debate. It is filled with well-reasoned and very complex arguments about is this the right thing to do? Is this the right thing to do now? What happens when we do this? How do we say this?\u201d",
      "Two-time Oscar winner Clooney returns to Murrow at a time when journalists are under fire from the new U.S. administration and being denied access for not following White House talking points.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to remount or do the play for any real political reasons,\u201d says Heslov, a frequent Clooney collaborator who is also making his Broadway writing debut. \u201cIt turns out that the environment might be ripe for it.\u201d",
      "Murrow had a large presence in Clooney\u2019s home growing up. His father, Nick Clooney, a veteran journalist, worked as a TV news anchor and host in a variety of cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He also wrote a newspaper column in Cincinnati and taught journalism at American University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the son of a journalist, a proper journalist, a guy who tells the truth. My father\u2019s still out there fighting the good fight,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cI believe in it. I believe in the whole idea of how this works.\u201d",
      "Clooney is part of a starry group of Hollywood veterans arriving on Broadway this season, a list that includes Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons, Sarah Snook and John Mulaney.",
      "Clooney insisted before he came that he didn't want to be the highest paid actor on Broadway. It mirrored the time he mortgaged his house and paid himself a salary of just $1 to finance the movie version of \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like, pay Patti LuPone the most of anybody on Broadway. Pay somebody who\u2019s paid their dues. It shouldn\u2019t be somebody who\u2019s doing his first Broadway play,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be part of that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The box office for a ticket to see him at the Winter Garden is white hot even before previews begin but Clooney deflects that to Murrow \u2014 it's not me, he suggests, it's the character he's playing.",
      "\u201cThe words of Edward Murrow are words that kind of soothe us,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a salve for insanity. And I think people are excited to be in a room and share some of those conversations.\u201d",
      "Clooney hasn't done a full-length play since he got his Equity Card in 1986 in Chicago as the comic relief in \u201cVicious,\u201d about punk icon Sid Vicious. \u201cMost of the cast members that I\u2019m working with weren\u2019t born when I did my last play. So it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says.",
      "He thought he'd missed his chance at Broadway, a notch on many actor's bucket list. He's 63 now and it would mean uprooting his family for months.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded in my career. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t succeeded, but I hadn\u2019t done anything on Broadway and I thought maybe it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been offered a couple of plays that I didn\u2019t think I was right for, and I thought if I was going to do it, I should do something that I was right for. And this was an opportunity where I thought, \u2018Well, I know how to tell this story. I may not do a great job with it. You know, I may really screw it up, but I know what\u2019s required of the thing.\u2019\u201d"

      "The trial of seven people charged in connection with alleged cyberbullying targeting the artistic director of last summer\u2019s Paris Olympics\u2019 opening and closing ceremonies has started in a Paris court",
      "PARIS -- The trial of seven people charged in connection with alleged cyberbullying targeting the artistic director of last summer\u2019s Paris Olympics\u2019 opening and closing ceremonies has started in a Paris court.",
      "Thomas Jolly filed a complaint for death threats after receiving homophobic and antisemitic abuse on social networks. The online attacks erupted after Jolly\u2019s acclaimed but controversial opening spectacle on the Seine in July \u2014 a queer-inclusive, high-energy fusion of tradition and modernity.",
      "Local media reported that Jolly did not attend Wednesday\u2019s hearing, with two of the people charged also not attending because they were either sick or could not make themselves available.",
      "The abuse last summer quickly escalated, including attacks based on Jolly's sexual orientation and wrongly assumed Israeli roots, and reportedly aimed to silence the artistic intent of the show. Jolly responded by filing a formal complaint with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office on July 31, prompting an investigation that led to arrests in the south of France in October 2024.",
      "The seven people charged, ranging in age from 22 to 79, face counts of death threats, aggravated insults, and cyberbullying \u2014 serious allegations carrying the weight of potential prison time and heavy fines.",
      "A verdict in the Jolly\u2019s case is expected at a later date.",
      "The arrests were seen as a first step in France\u2019s fight against cyberbullying, which authorities noted has become increasingly sophisticated. In Jolly\u2019s case, prosecutors pointed to the disturbing \u201cpack behavior\u201d of attackers acting independently to escalate the harassment, a pattern seen in other online hate campaigns.",
      "Jolly\u2019s complaint came after the opening ceremony prompted a storm of outrage in the wake of a contentious scene featuring drag queens and other performers. Although Jolly has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t inspired by \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d vocal criticism of the show from some quarters interpreted it as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s painting depicting Jesus Christ and his apostles.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron extended full support to Jolly and all performing artists who were part of the Olympics opening show. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also expressed \u201cunwavering support\u201d of Jolly in the face of the threats and harassment.",

      "EDINA, Minn. -- Joey Molland, a guitarist with the Welsh pop-rock band Badfinger that was known for such 1970s hits as \u201cNo Matter What\u201d and \u201cDay After Day,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Molland was the last to join and had been the last survivor from the most famous lineup of the group, which recorded for the Beatles \u2019 Apple label. His death was confirmed Tuesday by Sam Sheffield-West, the funeral director at Washburn-McReavy Funeral Chapels in Edina, Minnesota. Molland had lived in the state for decades. Additional details about his death weren't immediately available.",
      "Badfinger was a quartet that also included singer-guitarist Pete Ham, bassist Tom Evans and drummer Tom Gibbins. They were among the first acts signed to Apple after the Beatles launched it in 1968 and would remain closely associated with the Beatles \u2014 not always to Badfinger's liking \u2014 throughout their brief years of success. Molland even grew up near Liverpool's Penny Lane, immortalized in the Beatles song of the same name.",
      "Badfinger's breakout hit, \u201cCome and Get It,\u201d was written and produced by Paul McCartney, and another top 10 single, \u201cDay After Day,\u201d was produced by George Harrison and featured Harrison's slide guitar. \u201cNo Matter What\u201d was produced by Apple official/Beatles assistant Mal Evans, and another Badfinger song, \u201cWithout You,\u201d became a hit for Beatles friend Harry Nilsson. Molland and his bandmates would also appear at Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for Bangladesh and provide backing on two Beatles member's solo albums: Harrison's \u201cAll Things Must Pass\u201d and John Lennon's \u201cImagine.\u201d",
      "Critics could not stop likening Badfinger's catchy melodies, layered harmonies and tight arrangements to their benefactors: \u201cIt\u2019s as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo had been reincarnated as Joey, Pete, Tom, and Mike of Badfinger,\" Rolling Stone wrote of them in 1970. Even the band's name originated from the Beatles. Badfinger had called itself the Ivies in the years preceding their joining Apple, but, at the suggestion of Apple official/Beatles assistant Neil Aspinall, agreed to change it to Badfinger. (The working title of the Beatles' \u201cWith a Little Help from My Friends\u201d was \u201cBad Finger Boogie\u201d).",
      "Their time on top ended after 1972. Amid cutbacks at Apple and allegations of financial mismanagement, Badfinger left for Warner Bros., faded commercially and sustained a tragic loss when Ham took his life in 1975. After initially breaking up, the remaining members periodically reunited but never approached their early success.",
      "Evans took his own life in 1983 and Gibbins died of a brain aneurysm in 2005.",
      "Molland remained active well after Badfinger's prime, touring until his health began to fail last year and releasing such solo albums as \u201cThis Way Up\u201d \u201cAfter the Pearl\u201d and \u201cBe True To Yourself.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was raised to go to work \u2014 to get up in the morning and go to work,\u201d he told The Associated Press in 2001.",

      "Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s west side, but this year there\u2019s even more, with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school back in the top parade league for the first time in 57 years",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, a favela on Rio de Janeiro's west side, but this year the pulse is even stronger with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school returning to the top samba parade league for the first time in almost 60 years.",
      "As one of Rio's 12 top-tier samba schools, Unidos de Padre Miguel will have its shot at fame, perhaps even glory \u2014 all while bringing in more money into its community.",
      "Last year, competing in the second division, Padre Miguel received about 900,000 reais ($150,000) from City Hall, missing out on the lucrative sponsorship deals and revenue from television rights, pre-Carnival parties and ticket sales enjoyed by top-flight samba schools. But their victory in last year's Carnival secured their place in the main event that kicks off Sunday night.",
      "The shift has sent Padre Miguel\u2019s budget this year ballooning more than tenfold, to about 11 million reais ($2 million), including nearly 2 million reais from the city, according to the samba school's deputy chairman Dr. Willie Baracho.",
      "The school has already invested a significant portion into the community, funding local seamstresses, carpenters and welders for parade preparations.",
      "Vila Vintem is already experiencing the positive effects. Several of the favela's formerly jobless residents told The Associated Press they have bought smartphones and household appliances.",
      "Padre Miguel's new headquarters, nearing completion, will relocate rehearsals and other community activities from a hangar-like space that served as a vital center for the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cOur samba school has projects, it helps people, distributes food, throws parties for our children,\u201d Luana Borges, 42, said as she fixed details on several costumes, some bearing the school's traditional red and white colors.",
      "\u201cWhen Carnival comes, it offers opportunities to people like me,\" said Borges, who used to be unemployed.",
      "Nearly all samba schools sit in working-class neighborhoods around Rio\u2019s metropolitan region and compete against each other in the legendary Sambadrome parade grounds. Favelas in Rio are typically associated with dense, hillside neighborhoods, but they feature other geographies, too. The 14,000-resident Vila Vintem cropped up almost a century ago on flatlands next to a railway under construction.",
      "When first settled, the swampy area was said to be worth not even a \u201cvintem,\u201d the cheapest coin at the time, akin to a penny. Decades passed before basic services arrived, sometimes only after residents agreed to do the work themselves.",
      "Even with its new Carnival windfall, Padre Miguel remains a financial underdog.",
      "Baracho said its more popular rivals don\u2019t depend as much on city money, and can bring in up to 18 million reais ($3 million) when accounting for corporate sponsorships, sales of merchandise, coveted parade positions and cover charges for their pre-Carnival parties.",
      "While Padre Miguel employs almost all locals, Baracho said wealthier samba schools can spend over 1 million reais, for instance, on coaches and dancers, whose performance is one of the categories scored by judges.",
      "\u201cThe sky is the limit for some, but we fight,\u201d Baracho said. \u201cWe managed to get promoted because we are invested in our people, we work hard to foster our own creativity.\"",
      "Padre Miguel will be the first samba school to parade on Sunday night. Their procession will tell the story of Iya\u0301 Nasso\u0302, the founder of the first space in Brazil for rituals of the Afro-Brazilian faith Candomble.",
      "Experts say the best path for scrappy samba schools like Padre Miguel to sustain their community impact is to focus on avoiding relegation, rather than pursuing Carnival\u2019s top prize, amounting to 20% of the revenue of the tickets sold for the Champions Parade, which takes place the following weekend.",
      "\u201cThere's little chance for a samba school to win the title coming from the second division,\" said F\u00e1tima Costa de Lima, a Carnival researcher and scenic arts professor at Santa Catarina State University. \u201cIt happened before, but it is rare. The main goal for a samba school like (Padre Miguel) is to stay on.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Lima Leal has worked for Padre Miguel for 15 years, and paraded with the school for even longer. The 66-year-old says that creating jobs in Vila Vintem and being at the world-famous parade is worth every cent. She wants to see more next year \u2014 hopefully still in the top division.",
      "While sewing a white costume in her home workshop, Leal expressed the \u201camazing emotion\u201d of marching in the parade wearing something she helped create.",
      "\u201cCarnival brings a lot of jobs. Not only here, but everywhere,\u201d she said.",

      "While Wilde's outfit had a demure bohemian charm, actor Julia Fox leaned much further toward naked, arriving in a see-through wrap dress where the only adornment seemed to be strategically placed hair extensions.",
      "Doja Cat sang \u201cDiamonds Are Forever\u201d on the telecast during a James Bond tribute segment in what looked like only diamonds, with little fabric in between.

      "The musical \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d is a lot of things \u2014 a musical, a transgender parable, endlessly controversial and frequently criticized for its depiction of Mexican culture.",
      "\u201cWe are so grateful,\" Camille said in her acceptance speech. \"We wrote \u2018El Mal\u2019 as a song to denounce corruption, and we hope it speaks to the role music and art can play and continue to play as a force of good and progress in the world.\u201d",
      "The award was presented by Mick Jagger. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the first choice,\u201d he joked. \u201cThe producers really wanted Bob Dylan to do it.\u201d",

It\u2019s huge,\u201d added Ducol. \u201cWe were involved at the beginning of the construction of the story in music ... So everything is linked together, is woven together between the script, the screenplay, the songs. And so, we feel like it\u2019s our story, our movie ... It\u2019s not just a musical or reflecting a story or reflecting action in the movie. The music and the songs, in this movie, is the script. It is the story.\u201d",

      "\u201cFlow\u201d won the Oscar for animated feature at Sunday\u2019s 97th Academy Awards in Los Angeles, which aired starting at 2 a.m. Monday, in an upset over DreamWorks Animations\u2019 \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d",

The National Film Centre of Latvia calls the film \u201can unprecedented phenomenon in the history of Latvian cinema.\u201d",
      "More than 320,000 people have watched it in theaters across Latvia, an audience larger than any other film screened in the country in the last 30 years, according to the film center.

      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Were it not for the absence of an Oscar in his hands, you wouldn't have known Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet lost best actor to Adrien Brody as he sauntered with a smile into the Vanity Fair party.",
      "Once he got inside, Chalamet's grin grew even bigger as he was surrounded with love on all sides at the Beverly Hills bash that is the most luminescent of the post-Oscar parties, where winners and losers alike kicked up their heels, downed champagne and ate In-N-Out Burger late Sunday and early Monday to celebrate the end of a long night and a long awards season.",
      "Changed out of the bright yellow tuxedo he wore to the ceremony into a simpler white shirt and black suit, Chalamet hugged his girlfriend's sisters, Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner, who had awaited his arrival from the ceremony. He put his phone to his ear and struggled to hear over the thumping bass, but then waved over an arriving Kylie Jenner, who joined him with a kiss.",
      "Chris Rock was indignant on Chalamet's behalf, loudly declaring he was robbed when he didn't win for playing Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d as the two posed for a picture.",

      "The engraving station is always buzzing with activity as people try to get a glimpse of the victors.

      "When Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Last fall, Sean Baker was sitting in a Manhattan restaurant, talking about a poll. The survey, about sex in movies and television, showed that Gen Z moviegoers were mostly turned off by sex in film.",
      "\u201cThat broke my heart. I thought, there\u2019s something wrong here,\u201d said Baker. \u201cYou\u2019re OK with all the violence that\u2019s out there? Sex is a vital part of existence. Why don\u2019t you want to see sex in our stories?\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember being on set and being like: We\u2019re pushing against that poll.\u201d",
      "When Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards on Sunday, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner. \u201cAnora,\u201d about an erotic dancer (Mikey Madison, the best actress winner ) who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, is atypically sexually explicit for a best picture winner \u2014 a class that includes more staid movies like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201d A young woman\u2019s relationship to her own sexuality has not been, historically speaking, in the Oscars' wheelhouse.",
      "But that\u2019s just one quality that makes \u201cAnora\u201d unique as a best picture winner. The film, made for $6 million and distributed by Neon, was made with little interest in the mainstream. If anything, \u201cAnora\u201d was more oriented to the Cannes Film Festival, the French citadel of cinema, where it won the Palme d\u2019Or last May \u2014 a prize that Baker said meant the most to him.",
      "But, increasingly, these are converging movie worlds. In the last five years, four Palme d\u2019Or winners have been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d (also distributed by Neon), which became the first non-English language movie to win Hollywood\u2019s top prize.",
      "\u201cAnora,\u201d a film that inverts a Hollywood fairy tale like \u201cPretty Woman,\u201d is \u2014 like many of the winners on Sunday \u2014 an unabashedly modern movie and a film comfortable, even proud of the label of \u201ccinema.\u201d In a movie industry where manufactured franchise stewardship rules the day, \u201cAnora\u201d was celebrated, in part, because it's the real deal.",
      "It's also a more traditional choice than it might seem. Baker, a filmmaker who has sworn off making a series, a studio film or anything for streaming, is an apostle of '70s cinema. At an Oscars that host Conan O\u2019Brien called \u201cthe 97th Longform Content Awards,\u201d \u201cAnora\u201d \u2014 which shared some of the same Brooklyn streets as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d \u2014 stood for upholding an increasingly threatened theatrical legacy, with Baker ardently defending a very old-fashioned thing: the big screen.",
      "\u201cFilmmakers, keep making films for the big screen. I know I will,\u201d Baker said from the Dolby Theatre stage. \u201cDistributors, please focus first and foremost on the theatrical releases of your films. Parents, introduce your children to feature films in movie theaters and you will be molding the next generation of movie lovers and filmmakers. And for all of us, when we can please watch movies in a theater and let\u2019s keep the great tradition of the moviegoing experience alive and well.\u201d",
      "The coronation of \u201cAnora\u201d was a triumph for independent moviemaking, but that\u2019s also been a battle waged and won before. We\u2019ve seen \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d best \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d defeat \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Last year\u2019s crowning of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was, if anything, an exception in a string of smaller best pictures that haven't fit the Oscar mold. \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2023 winner, was antic, lewd and about the furthest thing possible from \u201cOscar bait.\u201d",
      "What was different this year was that the stiffest competition for \u201cAnora\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201cWicked\u201d or \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d or any other studio product. It was \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d All of the major award winners on Sunday hailed from movies made independently. At the Oscars, the studios are out of the picture.",
      "That trend has been developing for years, but the 97th Academy Awards showed just how much things have changed. In the best animated category, where Universal and DreamWorks\u2019 \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d was the heavy favorite, \u201cFlow,\u201d a wordless Latvian movie made with open-source software, triumphed instead.",
      "\u201cAny kid now has tools that are used to make these now Academy-winning films,\u201d \u201cFlow\u201d director Gints Zilbalodis said backstage. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re going to see all kinds of exciting films being made from kids who might not have had a chance to do this before.\u201d",
      "That win, like those for \u201cAnora,\u201d suggested the academy\u2019s international voters have emerged as a dominant bloc. When the academy, reacting to pressure to diversify its ranks, brought in new members in recent years, it cast a wide net overseas. Hundreds of new international voters \u2014 people more likely to favor what succeeds in Cannes or Venice \u2014 now significantly sway the Oscars.",
      "What does that mean for the Academy Awards going forward? A further tilt toward indie and arthouse cinema will surely alienate some viewers. \u201cAnora,\u201d with $16 million in domestic ticket sales, is one of the lowest-grossing best picture winners ever. Oscar producers did everything they could to lean into bigger films, opening with a lavish medley by \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, cutting repeatedly to a mascot sandworm from \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and even paying James Bond tribute.",
      "The 007 musical number was oddly timed, coming on the heels of the franchise\u2019s creative takeover by Amazon MGM Studios after decades of Broccoli family stewardship. It seemed to only highlight how much of Hollywood\u2019s regular, day-to-day business of brand management lay outside the new Oscar landscape.",
      "But just as assuredly as an \u201cAnora\u201d Academy Awards might turn some away, it could also inspire a new generation of cinephiles. \u201cAnora\u201d is at turns screwball farce, neorealistic drama, capitalism satire and devastating tragicomedy. It\u2019s arguably one of the best best picture winners of recent years, a movie that tries on nearly every genre before concluding in an unforgettable scene that catapults \u201cAnora\u201d into something classic and outside of time.",
      "What aftershocks will follow Baker's Oscar romp remains to be seen. But shortly after the Academy Awards concluded, 3.9 magnitude tremors were felt in nearby Burbank \u2014 a fitting coda for the small quake of \u201cAnora.\u201d"

      "Palestinians cheered the Oscar win of the Palestinian-Israeli documentary \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d documenting the struggle of West Bank villagers facing possible expulsion by the Israeli military",
      "AL-TUWANEH, West Bank -- Just last week, Israeli troops came and tore down a Palestinian family\u2019s shed in this remote, hilly corner of the West Bank, residents say. It was the latest instance of destruction targeting a collection of hamlets whose population is threatened with expulsion.",
      "Palestinians in the Masafer Yatta area cheered the Oscar win of the documentary \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts life in the beleaguered community, and hoped it will bring them some help.",
      "In al-Tuwaneh, one of the hamlets that make up Masafer Yatta, Salem Adra said his family stayed up all night for the Oscar ceremony. They watched as his older brother, Basel Adra, the film\u2019s co-director, came on stage to accept the award for best documentary.",
      "\u201cIt was such a huge surprise, such joy,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d follows Basel Adra as he risks arrest to document the destruction of Masafer Yatta at the southern edge of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, joined by his co-director, Israeli journalist and filmmaker, Yuval Abraham.",
      "The joint Palestinian-Israeli production has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. Five years in the making, it gained greater resonance amid Israel\u2019s devastating military campaign in Gaza that forced almost its entire population from their homes, as well as increasing raids in the West Bank that have caused the displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "At the same time, the film has raised hackles in Israel, scarred by the bloody the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas that triggered the war.",
      "Salem Adra, who at times helped his brother film for the movie, said he hoped the Oscar win \u201copens the world\u2019s eyes to what\u2019s happening here in Masafer Yatta.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a win for all of Palestine and for everyone who lives in Masafer Yatta,\u201d he said.",
      "He said that since the film was first released, threats and pressure against his family have increased. Their car has been stoned by settlers. After the movie won an award at the Berlin International Film Festival a year ago, the military returned over and over to the family home, and once detained his father, searching his phone and asking, \u201cWhy are you filming?\u201d",
      "The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Israel said the Bedouin did not have permanent structures in the area. But families say they have lived and herded their sheep and goats across the area long before Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "After a 20-year legal battle by residents, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court upheld the expulsion order in 2022. The around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but troops regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2013 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",
      "Salem Adra said the latest destruction came Wednesday, when troops tore down the shed of a family in a nearby hamlet.",
      "Standing on a stony ridge above al-Tuwaneh, Salem Adra said Jewish settlers backed by the military have set up 10 outposts around the village since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Shepherd Raed al-Hamamdeh, 48, led his herd of goats across the rocky land. He pointed to one outpost \u2013 with tents and a trailer flying the flag of an Israeli military unit \u2013 on the other side of a small valley. Farmers no longer tend the olive grove in the valley for fear of being attacked.",
      "Al-Hamamdeh said the military uses drones to drive off herds if they get too close to the outposts. \u201cSettlers attack. When we herd sheep, we can\u2019t go far as you can see. Only up to this point can we reach,\u201d he said. He pointed to the rubble of a house that he said settlers had destroyed, driving out the family and burning their furniture.",
      "In Israel, the film garnered little media attention since its release \u2014 and what attention it did get has been angry. When it won the documentary prize at the Berlin festival, its Israeli director Abraham came under fire for an acceptance speech that called for an end to the war in Gaza without mentioning Hamas\u2019 initial attack and taking of the hostages held in Gaza.",
      "In his Oscar acceptance speech, Abraham spoke of both. But that did little to calm criticism in Israel. Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar called the win \u201ca sad moment for the world of cinema.\u201d He said the film distorted reality and accused its creators of using \u201cdefamation\u201d of Israel as a way help promote the documentary.",
      "Usually, Israeli films that are nominated for prestigious international prizes receive boastful accolades in Israel.",
      "But after the Hamas attack, \u201ceveryone is in mourning or in trauma, we can hardly hear any other voice on any other subject,\u201d Raya Morag, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who specializes in cinema and trauma, said last week.",
      "On Monday, she said it wasn\u2019t yet clear if the win will bring the documentary more attention in Israel. But, she said, \u201cit won\u2019t be possible for people to ignore the message of the two directors, including for people that haven\u2019t seen the film.\u201d",
      "In his acceptance speech Sunday night, Basel Adra called on the world \u201cto stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people.\u201d",
      "He said he hoped his newborn daughter would \u201cnot have to live the same life I am living now \u2026 Always feeling settler violence, home demolitions and forceful displacement.\u201d",
      "On Monday, his brother Salem walked down from the ridge along with his 4-year-old son to a family home.",
      "He checked the CCTV cameras the family has set up around the house to watch for settlers. They were still filming.",

      "MILAN -- MILAN (AP) \u2014 Giorgio Armani created an intimate salon for the fashion crowd to get a close-up view Sunday of the latest Milan runway collection from his 50-year-old signature brand, an extravaganza of textures, craftsmanship, and the designer\u2019s trademark elegance.",
      "Actor Lily James, ballet dancer Maria Bogdanovich and model Ana Beatriz Barros were among the guests who sat cozily on curving sofas for the back-to-back shows. Armani also invited Italian senator-for-life Liliana Segre, a Holocaust survivor, and figures from Milan's cultural institutions.",
      "The opening look encapsulated the sensorial complexity of the fall-winter 2025-26 womenswear collection, titled \u201cRoots.\u201d A swirl of lush faux fur framed the face, while liquidy silken trousers caught the light, and a leather-trimmed tweed jacket pulled it all together.",
      "Sure-footed flat booties were the footwear of the season\u2014some featuring radiant strips of leather, others with gentle folds of velvet.",
      "Each ensemble was a perfect combination of soothing neutrals, harmonizing seemingly contrasting materials. Trousers were either loose and pleated at the front or gathered loosely like jodhpurs, as the designer drew inspiration from the East. Jacket were made from contrasting jacquards or delicate quilting.",
      "Feather-light, sometimes sheer evening wear sparkled with beading occasionally patterned like geodes. Sculpted bodices added a couture element, standing away from the body.",
      "\u201cFor Giorgio Armani, each collection is a return to his roots, reaffirmation of an authentic style that evolves, drawing on itself, while remaining firmly anchored in reality,\u201d the show notes said.",
      "Armani, 90, was escorted by two glittering models as he took his final bow. As has been customary, Armani's was the last major runway show of Milan Fashion Week before the crowd decamped to continue womenswear fashion previews in Paris."

      "LOS ANGELES -- After a topsy-turvy Oscar season in which frontrunners were constantly shuffled, old tweets hobbled a top contender and space was held for \u201cWicked,\u201d the 97th Academy Awards get underway Sunday.",
      "Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, will bring to a close one of the most unpredictable Oscar races in recent memory.",
      "The ceremony kicks off 7 p.m. EST and will be broadcast by ABC and streamed on Hulu. Conan O\u2019Brien is hosting for the first time. The official red carpet preshow on ABC and Hulu starts at 6:30 p.m. Unofficial E! red carpet coverage begins at 4 p.m. EST and The Associated Press will livestream arrivals beginning at 3 p.m.",
      "Light rain was in the forecast for Sunday morning in Los Angeles, which is still recovering from wildfires that devastated the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods earlier this year.",
      "The fires affected many throughout the film industry and within the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. Some even called for the cancellation of Hollywood\u2019s awards season. While his Pacific Palisades house was spared, O\u2019Brien has been living out of a hotel the last two months. Oscar producers have said the show will celebrate the city\u2019s resilience.",
      "The lead nominee is Netflix\u2019s \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d with 13 nominations, but that film has seen its chances crater following uproar over years-old offensive tweets by its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, the first openly trans actor nominated for best actress.",
      "The favorite is Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora,\u201d about a sex worker who weds the son of a Russian oligarch. The Neon release, the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or winner, won with the producers, directors and writers guild. The only movie with the same resume to not win best picture is \u201cBrokeback Mountain.\u201d",
      "Its closest competition is \u201cConclave,\u201d the papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes. It won at the BAFTAs and the SAG Awards, wins that came just as Pope Francis was hospitalized for double pneumonia. Oscar voting concluded before the pope fell ill.",
      "Also in the mix are \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d nominated for 10 awards, and the musical hit \u201cWicked,\u201d also with 10 nominations. Several of the early craft Oscars could be shared between \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "For the first time, an actor is nominated for playing the sitting U.S. president. Sebastian Stan is nominated for best actor for his performance as a young Donald Trump in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d as is his co-star, Jeremy Strong, for playing Roy Cohn. Trump has called those involved with the film \u201chuman scum.\u201d",
      "The political tenor of this year\u2019s ceremony could be volatile, with the Oscars coming weeks into the second Trump administration and falling two days after the president\u2019s dramatic rupture with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.",
      "Speaking earlier this week, O\u2019Brien said he'll strive to strike a delicate balance.",
      "\u201cI cannot ignore the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also have to remember it\u2019s threading a needle. I also have to remember what we\u2019re here to celebrate and infuse the show with positivity.\u201d",
      "While the supporting acting categories feature overwhelming favorites in Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) and Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d), both best actor and best actress are close contests.",
      "In best actress, Demi Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) is most likely to win, but Mikey Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d) or Fernanda Torres (\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d) could pull off the upset.",
      "Adrien Brody is favored in best actor for his performance in \u201cThe Brutalist. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stands a decent chance of beating him, for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The 29-year-old Chalamet, who won at the Screen Actors Guild, would become the youngest best actor winner ever, edging Brody\u2019s record, set in 2003 in his win for \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d",
      "This year's Oscars are unspooling after a turbulent year for the film industry. Ticket sales were down 3% from the previous year and more significantly from pre-pandemic times. The strikes of 2023 played havoc with release schedules in 2024. Many studios pulled back on production, leaving many out of work. The fires, in January, only added to the pain.",
      "Last year\u2019s telecast, propelled by the twin blockbusters of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie,\u201d led the Oscars to a four-year viewership high, with 19.5 million viewers. This year, with smaller independent films favored in the most prominent awards, the academy will be tested to draw as large of an audience.",
      "With a not particularly starry array of best song nominees, the academy has done away with performances of original songs this year. But there will be music, including a performance by \u201cWicked\u201d stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, and a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, with Queen Latifah.",
      "Last year\u2019s acting winners \u2014 Emma Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph \u2014 will also take part in the ceremony. Though the academy initially said it would bring back the \u201cfab five\u201d style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per category, organizers have reportedly abandoned those plans.",
      "The ceremony will be taking place days following the death of Gene Hackman. The 95-year-old two-time Oscar winner and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead Wednesday at their New Mexico home.",

      "\u201cFlow\u201d was made with Blender, a free, open-source graphics software tool using computer generated animation. The result is a dreamy aesthetic paired with a peaceful, yet post-apocalyptic, fable about a black cat, dog, capybara, ring-tailed lemur and secretary bird trying to survive a catastrophic flood. The film has no dialogue and forces viewers to be mesmerized by the unlikely relationship and understanding between the species trying to escape the rising waters.",

    "story": [
      "The Metropolitan Opera is staging a production of Herman Melville's masterpiece about a white whale, \u2018Moby-Dick",
      "When Leonard Foglia was invited to direct an opera based on Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece about a white whale, his first reaction was: \u201cMoby-Dick. That\u2019s great!\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I ran to a used bookstore and got the book,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand I thought: \u2018Oh my God, what am I in for here?\u2019 It\u2019s so daunting. I didn\u2019t panic, but I thought, \u2018How do we do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "How he and his collaborators did it will be on display at the Metropolitan Opera beginning March 3. The opera is composed by Jake Heggie to a libretto crafted by Gene Scheer.",
      "To begin with, Scheer had to whittle a novel of more than 600 pages down to a 64-page libretto. He kept as much of Melville\u2019s language as possible, and estimates that 40% to 50% of his libretto can be found in the original text, though he often tweaked the phrasing to make it more singable.",
      "Heggie and his initial partner, Terrence McNally (who withdrew for health reasons), had already decided to lop off the opening chapters, which take place on land. They set the entire opera aboard the whale-hunting ship Pequod.",
      "Another crucial change was renaming the narrator, calling him Greenhorn to reflect his status as a novice aboard the ship. Now the book\u2019s famous opening line, \u201cCall me Ishmael,\u201d is transposed to the very end of the opera when the character has matured.",
      "\u201cIn the novel, Ishmael is telling a story that happened many years ago,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cBut in the theater, you want to see it happen in real time. \u2026 We\u2019re watching him take in all the experiences so that when he says \u2018Call me Ishmael,\u2019 he\u2019s ready to write the book. In essence, this opera is the education of Ishmael.\u201d",
      "Tenor Stephen Costello, who is performing the role for the fifth time and is the lone cast holdover from the Dallas premiere in 2010, sees his character as \u201cthe only one who really has an arc.",
      "\u201cHe goes on the Pequod because there was nothing for him on land,\u201d Costello said. \u201cSo he\u2019s either going to die at sea or figure out who he is.\u201d",
      "In addition to Costello, the Met cast includes tenor Brandon Jovanovich as the vengeance-obsessed Captain Ahab. Pip, his cabin boy, is written as a \u201ctrousers role\u201d (a male character portrayed by a woman) and will be sung by soprano Janai Brugger. Starbuck, the first mate, will be baritone Peter Mattei, and bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green will sing the part of Queequeg. Karen Kamensek conducts the eight performances through March 29.",
      "The opera, commissioned to celebrate the opening of a new opera house in Dallas, has been a success from the beginning, drawing praise from audiences and critics \u2014 and even scholars.",
      "Bob Wallace, a professor at Northern Kentucky University and past president of the Melville Society, admired the opera so much that he wrote a book about its creation.",
      "\u201cScheer and Heggie did a brilliant job of shrinking the novel to make it fit the stage and yet preserve so much of the essence of it,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "As much as critics admired Scheer\u2019s adaptation and Heggie\u2019s tuneful, atmospheric and at times gripping score, they lavished special praise on the physical production, with sets by Robert Brill and projections by Elaine J. McCarthy.",
      "The action, Steve Smith wrote in The New York Times, \u201cplayed out against a multimedia-enriched staging that ranged from striking to near-miraculous.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most stunning effect is the way animated projections superimposed on a climbing wall that is curved a bit like a skateboard ramp create the illusion of the crew leaving the Pequod to board three whaling boats.",
      "\u201cA lot of the excitement and thrill of watching this is due to the work of the production team,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cLenny kept saying to me, \u2019You imagine it the way you want it, and let me figure out how to do it.\u201d",
      "That often involved imposing unusual physical demands on the singers. For instance, when Pip gets lost at sea, his character sings the equivalent of an operatic mad scene dangling high above the stage, with projections making it appear he\u2019s treading water.",
      "\u201cI said to Janai when we first rehearsed it,\u201d Foglia recalled, \u201cOK, you can just get mad at me now, because you have to sing your hardest aria hanging from not even a full harness, just a single wire.\u201d",
      "In addition, Queequeg and Greenhorn climb up and down ladders to sing at the top of the mastheads. Ahab, who has lost a leg in a prior encounter with Moby-Dick, has to hobble on a wooden prosthesis. And Greenhorn \u2014 finally named Ishmael \u2014 ends the opera grabbing onto a whale hook from a passing ship that lifts him to safety.",
      "\u201cI joke with them that everything opera singers count on in life \u2014 having both feet planted on the ground \u2014 I\u2019ve taken away from them,\u201d Foglia said.",

      "An artist in Denmark aims to raise awareness of the suffering caused by modern pig production with an art installation that opened Friday that includes three piglets who will be denied food and water and will starve to death.",
      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti is courting controversy to make a point about the treatment of pigs in Denmark, where about 25,000 piglets die daily as a result of the conditions in which they are bred.",
      "The central exhibit at Copenhagen's \u201cAnd Now You Care\u201d exhibition is a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing three piglets. As the exhibition opened Friday evening, they were still fine, but they will not be given food and drink, and can be expected to die of hunger within a few days.",
      "Evaristti says on his Instagram page that the exhibition \u201cis a confrontation with Denmark's bloody reality\u201d in slaughterhouses, and that he urges people to reduce their meat consumption and support agriculture that improves animal welfare.",
      "Denmark's largest and oldest animal welfare organization, Animal Protection Denmark, says it is grateful for Evaristti's interest in the problem, but disagrees with how he wants to convey it.",
      "\u201cWe completely understand the indignation\u201d of the artist, said Birgitte Damm, a spokesperson for the organization. \u201cBut we do not agree that three piglets, three individual living beings, should be starved and prevented from drinking until they die from it. It is illegal and it is abuse of the animals.\u201d",

      "Senate Republicans in Georgia have advanced two bills restricting gender-affirming care for transgender people",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Senate passed two bills Monday that would ban most gender-affirming care for minors and people incarcerated in state prisons, mirroring moves by Republicans across states and a handful of executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people.",
      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment. The law lets doctors prescribe puberty blockers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking (minors) to make changes that will have changes to the rest of their lives,\u201d bill sponsor Republican Sen. Ben Watson, of Savannah, said Monday. \u201cIt is not a fair decision to them. It is not a fair decision to the parents.\u201d",
      "A second bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson passed 37-15 and would ban most gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in state prisons.",
      "Last month, the chamber passed bills to ban transgender people from playing in school sports and cut off public funding for gender-affirming care for adults. The four bills will now head to the House for debate.",
      "Opponents said Republicans are playing politics by targeting transgender people and that lawmakers should focus on helping Georgians with more pressing issues such as housing and healthcare. They say both bills infringe on the rights of transgender people and their families to make decisions about gender-affirming care.",
      "\u201cThis body has promulgated bill after bill attacking trans people with the ultimate goal of making trans fols disappear. We\u2019ve been here before,\" said Senate Minority Whip Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat who is openly lesbian.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and most are facing lawsuits. A study released in January found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents with commercial insurance during a five-year period received gender-affirming medications such as puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "Jackson and other Democrats proposed a failed amendment to Watson\u2019s bill that would let minors receiving treatment keep going to avoid the medical and emotional ramifications of stopping midway.",
      "Sens. Elena Parent and Sonya Halpern, both Atlanta Democrats, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of transgender people but broke with their party to vote for Robertson\u2019s bill because they said they do not think taxpayers should pay for gender-affirming care for people in prison. Parent proposed an amendment to make an exception for incarcerated people already undergoing hormone replacement therapy that failed.",
      "\u201cI will not let my party be dragged into an argument that makes us look out of touch with the very people we claim to represent,\u201d Halpern said.",
      "Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat who has two transgender children, took the stand toward the end of the evening.",
      "\u201cIt felt like we were debating a political football instead of people,\" Harrell said of a debate on the school sports bill. \"And so I came to this well to remind people that we are talking about very real people \u2014 parents, children, families.\u201d",

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is dropping an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of the administration\u2019s first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump's second term began",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to drop an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of its first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was originally filed by the Biden administration, in a reversal that could have national implications for urgent care.",
      "The lawsuit had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences in Idaho, which has one of the country's strictest abortion bans.",
      "The Democratic administration had given similar guidance to hospitals nationwide in the wake of the Supreme Court 2022 decision overturning the right to abortion. It's being challenged in other conservative states.",
      "In Idaho, the state argued that its law does allow life-saving abortions and the Biden administration wrongly sought to expand the exceptions. The state agrees with the dismissal, so it does not need judicial approval, Justice Department attorneys wrote in court documents.",
      "Idaho doctors, meanwhile, say it remains unclear which abortion are legal, forcing them to airlift pregnant women of state if a termination might be part of the standard of care. It's often unclear in fast-moving emergencies whether pregnancy complications could ultimately prove fatal, doctors said in court documents.",
      "A judge has blocked Idaho from any abortion ban enforcement that would change emergency treatment at the state's largest hospital system for now.",
      "In his first term, Trump, a Republican, appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year. It ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations but left key legal questions unresolved.",
      "The case went before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. Those judges have not yet ruled.",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant."

The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",

But he would never do it for the attention,\u201d Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",

      "Measles has sickened nearly 150 mostly unvaccinated people in rural West Texas, and a school-age child has died",
      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",
      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the region, people echoed this sentiment about routine childhood vaccinations in interviews with the AP and The Texas Tribune. Often, though, they are less supportive of COVID-19 and flu shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that (Mennonites) don\u2019t vaccinate, and they put other people\u2019s families and children at exposure for it,\u201d said Stephen Spruill, a 36-year-old trucker from Seminole.",
      "But \"this is America. People have the right to choose.\u201d",
      "Macey Lane, 31, of Hobbs, said: \u201cI do support Donald Trump. I don\u2019t support not requiring vaccines.\u201d\u201c",
      "All of Lane\u2019s kids are vaccinated. Praising Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",
      "Mutikani, the Hobbs pediatrician, said she\u2019s seen vaccine hesitancy increase in recent years as parents come to her with worries that line up with what\u2019s trending on social media. \u201cVirulent\u201d misinformation is especially worrisome in rural areas with few news sources or where many people who don\u2019t regularly see doctors live, she said.",
      "And having \u201cthese really big, respected public figures openly going against the grain, going against research and what we know, it makes it really, really difficult,\u201d she said.",
      "Most Texans are still vaccinating their kids, including Jennifer Sanchez, a 26-year-old Odessa resident. She took her 6-year-old and 1-year-old to the local public health department last week to get the measles vaccine.",
      "She is disinfecting her house out of an abundance of caution, wishing she had more information on how to stop the spread.",

      "The security guard was shot around 1 p.m. Sunday inside the emergency room at HonorHealth Scottsdale Shea Medical Center, Scottsdale Police said in a news release.",
      "The shooting was the latest in a series of incidents of increasing violence against U.S. healthcare workers and highlighted the challenges of protecting them.",
      "The 30-year-old suspect was disarmed and detained by other members of the security team and staff before arriving officers arrested him, police said.",
      "Police on Monday identified the suspect as Maximillian Yanofsky. He was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on multiple charges including aggravated assault, police said.",
      "Efforts to contact a lawyer for Yanofsky on Monday weren't immediately successful.",
      "The security guard was taken to a trauma center for a higher level of care and remained hospitalized Monday, police said. A different security guard was injured in the hand and wrist during the incident, police said.",
      "Police said Yanofsky had been taken to HonorHealth Shea earlier in the day as a potential patient.",
      "No reason for the shooting was given. Police said officers were called about a disturbance in the emergency room that escalated to an altercation with security. Police said that during the altercation, Yanofsky took out a gun and shot the guard once in the upper body.",
      "Late last month, a man carrying a pistol and zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said.",
      "Last year, a man shot two corrections officers in the ambulance bay of an Idaho hospital while freeing a white supremacist gang member before he could be returned to prison. They were caught less than two days later.",
      "Healthcare and social assistance employees suffered almost three-quarters of nonfatal attacks on workers in the private sector in 2021 and 2022 for a rate more than five times the national average, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics."

      "Whitetop was donated to the Victory Junction camp in 2006, just two years after race car driver Kyle Petty \u2014 the son of NASCAR great Richard Petty \u2014 and his family founded the camp in honor of Petty's own son, Adam, who was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash while practicing for a race.",
      "The year-round free camp sits on 84 acres (34 hectares) in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) west of Raleigh. It\u2019s designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities.",
      "Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camp's barn director.",
      "\u201cHe really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,\" she said. \"He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.\u201d",
      "One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies.",
      "\u201cIf you try to take a picture of him from the side, he\u2019s not into it,\" Davis said. \"He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that it\u2019s like he\u2019s cheesing.\u201d",

      "Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camp\u2019s family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.",

      "Although Davis said Whitetop would like people to know not all llamas spit on you.",

Now he\u2019s poised to become director of the NIH, long called the government\u2019s crown jewel, as it faces mass firings and drastic funding cutbacks.",

      "But he faces scrutiny from Democrats furious that turmoil at the nation\u2019s largest funder of medical research threatens the development of cures and new treatments.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly important that we have a leader at NIH who will stand up for the agency\u2019s role as a world leader in lifesaving research,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state.",
      "Until recently, the $48 billion NIH had strong bipartisan support. NIH scientists conduct cutting-edge research at its 27 institutes specializing in diseases including cancer, chronic illnesses such as heart, lung and kidney disease, aging and Alzheimer\u2019s. Most of the agency\u2019s budget is dispersed to universities, hospitals and other research groups through highly competitive grants to conduct everything from basic research to clinical trials.",

      "At the time -- before vaccinations had begun \u2013 that view was embraced by some in the first Trump administration but was widely denounced by infectious disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya became a plaintiff in a Supreme Court case, Murthy v. Missouri, arguing he was \u201cunfairly censored\u201d on social media as part of government efforts to combat misinformation. While the case gained national attention, it was ultimately unsuccessful in a 6-3 ruling.",

      "In Republican Rep. David Valadao \u2019s central California district, 6 out of 10 people use Medicaid to pay for doctor visits and emergency room trips.",
      "And one-third of the population is covered by Medicaid in GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski's Alaska, one of the nation\u2019s costliest corners for health care.",
      "Each of these Republicans \u2014 and some of their conservative colleagues \u2014 lined up last week to defend Medicaid, in a departure from long-held GOP policies. Republicans, who already have ruled out massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare, are turning their attention to siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "But as a deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown nears, hesitation is surfacing among Washington's Republican lawmakers \u2014 once reliable critics of lofty government social welfare programs such as Medicaid \u2014 who say that deep cuts to the health care program could prove too untenable for people back home.",
      "\u201cI've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\u201d Valadao said on the House floor. \u201cAnd I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\u201d",

      "States and the federal government jointly pay for Medicaid, which offers nearly-free health care coverage for roughly 80 million poor and disabled Americans, including millions of children. It cost $880 billion to operate in 2023.",
      "Johnson has ruled out two of the biggest potential cuts: paying fixed, shrunken rates to states for care and changing the calculation for the share of federal dollars that each state receives for Medicaid. Just a few years ago, Johnson spearheaded a report that lobbied for some of those changes during the first Trump administration.",
      "Johnson insisted in a CNN interview that the focus will instead be ferreting out \u201cfraud, waste and abuse, in Medicaid, although it's unlikely to deliver the savings Republicans seek.",
      "GOP pressure over Medicaid is mounting, with some state party leaders joining the calls to preserve the program. States are already struggling with the growing cost of sicker patients and could be left to cover more if the federal government pulls back. In some states, the federal government picks up over 80%.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesota GOP lawmakers wrote the president recently warning that \u201ctoo deep of a cut is unmanageable in any instance.\u201d Gov. Joe Lombardo, R-Nev., told Congress in a letter that \u201cproposed reductions would put lives at risk.\" In Alaska, state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican and nurse, cited \u201chuge concerns\u201d during a floor speech.",

      "Work requirements, which could save as much as $109 billion over the next decade, seem to have solid support among GOP members, with some individual Republican-led states already moving to implement them.",
      "Republicans also could consider cuts in benefits or coverage, as well as eliminating a provider tax that states use to finance Medicaid, Altman added.",
      "Democrats warn that reductions are inevitable and could be dire.",
      "Starting Monday, TV ads will caution people across 20 congressional districts that hospitals are at risk of closing and millions of people could lose coverage if Republicans cut Medicaid \"to fund massive tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.\u201d The Democratic super political action committee House Majority Forward has launched the seven-figure campaign.",
      "Trump and Republicans have for years called to lower government spending on health care, but they have struggled to formulate a serious plan that gains traction. Trump, for example, has spent nearly a decade arguing for an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. His efforts to repeal the Obama-era national health care law failed during his first term and in his most recent presidential campaign he offered only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to adapt the program.",

      "Eating greasy food can keep you awake at night",
      "Anyone who has ever suffered in bed after eating three slices of pizza could surmise there is some relationship between food and sleep quality.",
      "For Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, years of studying the relationship confirmed it.",
      "Data from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don\u2019t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,\u201d St-Onge said.",
      "If bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better,\u201d co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge said the answer is yes. The book's recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.",
      "Nuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.",
      "Besides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.",
      "St-Onge noted that people shouldn\u2019t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,\u201d she said.",
      "Recipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.",
      "Craddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.",
      "\u201cMy instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,\u201d Craddock said.",
      "Instead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. \u201cIt was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.\u201d",
      "A Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used \u2014 a pork product high in saturated fat \u2014 is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.",
      "With numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.",
      "\u201cIf you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,\u201d she said.",

      "A book called \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better\" includes a nutrient-rich, vegetable-forward recipe for Mardi Gras gumbo",
      "This recipe from \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better\u201d was developed by Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, and Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge's research shows that a high-fiber diet can help lead to better sleep.",
      "This recipe for a nutrient-rich, vegetable-forward stew riffs on a style of Creole gumbo traditionally made vegetarian for Lent. It\u2019s also a great way to use up a crisper drawer full of greens and fresh herbs.",
      "The authors like to add a little bit of andouille-style chicken sausage for a hit of protein and tryptophan, but if you prefer a pescatarian option, leave out the sausage, replace the chicken stock with mushroom or vegetable broth, and top the finished dish with a few shrimp or even steamed crab or lobster claws.",
      "For a vegan option, replace the sausage with tempeh or a spicy or smoked plant-based sausage.",
      "Served with brown rice, any of these variations makes a well-balanced and sleep-supporting meal. Leftovers keep well in the freezer.",
      "Serves 4\u20136",
      "Total Time: 1 hr. 30 min.",
      "2 Tbsp. olive oil",
      "Three 21\u20442-oz. chicken andouille sausages, sliced 1\u20442 in. thick",
      "2 Tbsp. whole wheat flour",
      "2 medium yellow onions, finely chopped",
      "2 bunches scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced",
      "2 celery stalks, finely chopped",
      "1 green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and finely chopped",
      "2 bay leaves",
      "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "2 tsp. garlic powder",
      "2 tsp. dried thyme",
      "1 tsp. dried oregano",
      "1\u20442\u20131 tsp. cayenne pepper (optional)",
      "11\u20444 lb. mixed greens and fresh herbs, such as spinach, arugula, collards, kale, Swiss chard, broccoli rabe, parsley, and cilantro, chopped",
      "4 cups chicken stock",
      "3 cups cooked brown rice Lemon wedges, for serving",
      "In a large, heavy pot, heat the oil over medium until it begins to shimmer. Add the sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 6\u20138 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage to a heatproof bowl and reserve. Lower the heat to medium-low, then stir the flour into the oil that remains in the pot and cook, stirring frequently, just until the mixture, or roux, smells toasty, about 5 minutes. Add the onions, scallions, celery, bell pepper and bay leaves, season lightly with salt and black pepper, and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot frequently, until the onions are translucent, 12\u201314 minutes.",
      "Stir in the garlic powder, thyme, oregano and cayenne, if using, then add the greens a little at a time, allowing them to wilt before adding more, until they all fit in the pot. Stir in the chicken stock. Increase the heat to medium-high, bring the liquid to a full boil, and then decrease the heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the broth has thickened and the greens are meltingly tender and have turned from bright green to a muted olive color, 30\u201345 minutes (if you\u2019re using hardier greens like collards, they will take a bit longer to cook, while softer varieties like baby spinach will cook quickly).",
      "Stir in the reserved sausage, cover and continue cooking for 15 minutes. Adjust the seasoning with more salt and black pepper, then ladle into soup bowls. Top each bowl with a scoop of rice and a lemon wedge and serve hot."

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Forest Service has terminated $75 million awarded to the Arbor Day Foundation to help disadvantaged communities plant trees",
      "Arthur Johnson has lived in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward for nearly three decades, long enough to appreciate the trees that filter pollution from the big ships traveling the nearby Mississippi River and that offer shade on sweltering summer days.",
      "When Hurricane Katrina roared through two decades ago, it wiped out 200,000 trees across the city, including many in Johnson's neighborhood and several in his own yard. The city has struggled ever since to restore its tree canopy.",
      "Those efforts will be set back by the U.S. Forest Service's decision in mid-February to terminate a $75 million grant to the Arbor Day Foundation, which was working to plant trees in neighborhoods that might not otherwise be able to afford them. The program is the latest victim of a drive by President Donald Trump's administration against environmental justice initiatives.",
      "In New Orleans, part of the money was going to the environmental group Sustaining Our Urban Landscape (SOUL), which has planted more than 1,600 trees in the historically Black community but has now paused plans for another 900.",
      "Those are trees that largely low-income residents otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to plant or maintain, said the 71-year-old Johnson, who runs a local nonprofit, the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, that has helped SOUL with its work and done some tree plantings of its own in the area.",
      "\u201cYou're not just cutting out the tree, the environment\u201d with such cuts, said Johnson. If those trees aren\u2019t replaced and more aren\u2019t continually added, \u201cit really takes a toll on the sustainability of the Lower 9th Ward and its community.\u201d",
      "The benefits of trees are vast. They capture stormwater and replenish groundwater. They help clean the air in polluted areas, improve mental health, and cool air and surfaces of the built environment, especially during heat waves that are growing more intense and frequent with climate change.",
      "One study by the UCLA Luskin Center found that shade can reduce heat stress on the human body from 25% to 35% throughout the day. And much research shows that low-income and communities of color have fewer trees \u2014 and are hotter \u2014 than better-off neighborhoods.",
      "The Arbor Day Fund's grant was part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which sent $1.5 billion to the forest service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. In a Feb. 14 email canceling the grant, the Forest Service wrote that the award \"no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "But Dan Lambe, the Arbor Day Foundation's chief executive, said the projects weren't just going to serve disadvantaged people. They were going to benefit every member of the community, he said. In total, 105 nonprofits, municipalities and Indigenous organizations \u2014 from Alaska to Florida to Maine \u2014 have lost funding for critical environmental projects, the foundation said.",
      "\u201cThis was an opportunity to make a really meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s been disappointing,\" Lambe said.",
      "The Forest Service didn't say if other recipients of the $1.5 billion forestry investment also had grants terminated. In a statement, its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the agency was following directions to comply with Trump's executive orders.",
      "\u201cProtecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and thrive, remains a top priority for the USDA and the Forest Service,\u201d the agency said.",
      "For SOUL in New Orleans, losing the grant means they don't have the money to water trees already planted, and they've had to drop plans to hire three people. Another $2.5 million grant is on hold due to the federal funding freeze, and founder and executive director Susannah Burley said the nonprofit's survival is uncertain. Its annual budget is a little more than $1 million.",
      "\u201cWe kind of are lost because we don\u2019t know if we should be planning to close our doors or if we should be planning for next season,\u201d she said.",
      "For others who were set to get Arbor Day Foundation money, the loss is not existential but still devastating. In the city-county of Butte-Silver Bow in southwest Montana, forester Trevor Peterson was going to use a $745,250 grant to buy chain saws, rigging gear and other essential tools, remove up to 200 dead or dying cottonwoods and plant as many as 1,000 trees as part of a decades-long effort to replenish trees cut to make way for copper mining. He wanted to help organize large community events focused on education, hoping to impart the knowledge necessary for future stewardship of the urban forest.",
      "\u201cWe will now have to go back to the drawing board to determine where to go from here,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson County, Oregon, was awarded a $600,000 grant to replant trees after wildfires in 2020 destroyed thousands of homes and charred more than 60,000 trees. The town of Talent lost two-thirds of its trees.",
      "The nonprofit Oregon Urban Rural and Community Forestry, founded in the fires' aftermath, fought for years to get a single dollar, recalled Mike Oxendine, the group's founder and director.",
      "The grant money from the Arbor Day Foundation was being used to help low-income and disadvantaged mobile home park residents \u2014 among the hardest-hit by the fires \u2014 identify and remove hazardous trees badly burned or killed, and replant trees for shade and cooling.",
      "\u201cThis is a rural red area that needs it badly,\u201d said Oxendine. \u201cWe hit temperatures that exceed 110 degrees every summer now. We go through massive droughts and we\u2019re always prone to wildfire here.\u201d",
      "The loss of funding will create a \u201ctremendous burden\u201d for the organization, he said.",

      "The number of babies born in South Korea has rebounded for the first time in nine years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said Thursday. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said that another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate poses a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say that it will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people don't want to have babies, owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in the brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue that the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi said."

      "The latest cases, confirmed by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program, were detected in Sindh and Punjab provinces. This brings the total number of polio cases in Pakistan to five since January 2025. In 2024, Pakistan recorded 74 polio cases.",
      "The latest development comes as health workers conclude a targeted vaccination drive in high-risk areas later Friday. Earlier this month, authorities launched a weeklong nationwide anti-polio campaign aiming to immunize 44.2 million children under the age of five.",
      "Escorted by police, polio teams go door-to-door to administer the oral vaccine, though they are often attacked by militants who falsely claim that vaccination efforts are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children. Since the 1990s, more than 200 polio workers and the police assigned to protect them have been killed in attacks."

      "\"Measles anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control say on their website.",
      "Here's a brief look at the global measles situation.",
      "According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles in 2023 and 107,500 died. Most were unvaccinated people or children younger than five. Cases were most common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where incomes are low and health services insufficient.",
      "In places where measles have largely been eradicated, cases have been spread by travelers from other countries.",
      "While measles-related deaths declined slightly in 2023, the number of outbreaks increased. Major outbreaks took place in 57 countries in 2023, including India and Indonesia, Russia, Yemen and Iraq. The largest number of cases in 2023 was 311,500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The worldwide rate of childhood vaccinations has fallen in recent years, to 83% in 2023 from 86% in 2019, partly due to disruptions in immunization and health care due to the pandemic.",
      "The WHO estimates that vaccination helped to prevent more than 60 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2023, as efforts to get the shots to more people ramped up. In 2000, 800,062 people are estimated to have died of measles. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, major epidemics caused about 2.6 million deaths a year.",
      "Measles is so highly infectious that 95% immunity is required to prevent epidemics, the WHO says. Put another way, it infects about 9 of 10 people exposed if they lack immunity.",
      "The WHO and others are backing an effort called \u201cImmunization Agenda 2021-2030,\u201d to push for elimination of measles.",
      "Independent experts declared the Americas free of endemic measles in 2016 but that status was lost in 2018 due to measles outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela. Reduced vaccination rates are undermining efforts to fully eradicate the disease, experts say.",
      "Global health organizations and other groups have increased their efforts to speed up immunization programs and close the gaps in prevention."

      "A bill that would strip gender identity protections from Iowa\u2019s civil rights code has received final legislative approval and now goes to the governor",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state\u2019s civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.",
      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \u201cshall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\u201d",
      "The measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.",
      "\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women\u2019s sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court.",

      "In what's believed to be a U.S. first, Texas is suing Granados and two other physicians over claims that they violated the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, calling the doctors \u201cscofflaws\u201d in lawsuits filed last fall that threaten to impose steep fines and revoke their medical licenses. He denies the accusations, and all three doctors have asked courts to dismiss the cases.",

      "Some hospitals have already begun unwinding services for pediatric patients. But, so far, only Texas is demonstrating what punishing doctors looks like when bans are allegedly broken.",
      "Granados, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was meticulous in halting transgender care before Texas' ban took effect in 2023. He denied that he continued prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to transitioning patients and said he was initially unclear which patients, who are not named in the lawsuit, he is accused of wrongfully treating.",
      "The other accused doctors \u2014 both in Dallas \u2014 are under temporary court orders not to see patients and only practice medicine in research and academic settings.",

      "The lawsuits are believed to be the first time a state has brought enforcement under laws that ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors, which Republicans have enacted in 27 states, including this month in Kansas over the Democratic governor\u2019s veto. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas.",
      "Nationwide, doctors and hospital executives are reevaluating transgender health programs that carry a widening risk of litigation and losing federal funding. For transgender Americans, the climate has narrowed options for care and deepened fears.",
      "Trump has launched a broad charge against transgender rights quickly in his second term, signing executive orders that include barring schools from using federal education dollars to support students who are socially transitioning. Supporters say restrictions protect vulnerable children from what they see as a \u201cradical\u201d ideology about gender and making irreversible medical decisions.",
      "The Texas lawsuits were brought by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously gone beyond the state's borders to launch investigations into gender-affirming treatment.",
      "His office did not respond to requests for an interview. At a court hearing Wednesday involving the Dallas doctors, an attorney in Paxton\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions to the agency\u2019s press office.",
      "\u201cI will enforce the law to the fullest extent to prevent any doctor from providing these dangerous drugs to kids,\u201d Paxton said in a statement this month.",
      "Granados is one of two pediatric endocrinologists in El Paso, a desert city of about 700,000 where mountains rise in the distance.",
      "Granados, 48, is from Ciudad Juarez, the neighboring Mexican city that sprawls out south of El Paso. He said that after attending medical school in Mexico he completed additional training in New York and Connecticut but he wanted to return to what he said is an underserved region.",
      "He opened a gender clinic at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso before starting his own practice in 2019. Before the ban, Granados said, treating transgender youth was just an extension of his practice that also treats youth with diabetes, growth problems and early puberty.",
      "He said he accepted transgender patients only if they had first received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a mental health provider.",
      "\u201cIt was not different from doing everything else that a pediatric endocrinologist does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just taking care of children who required that specific therapy.\u201d",
      "Emiliana Edwards was among them. Now 18, she called Granados an \u201camazing\u201d caregiver who carefully explained her gender-affirming treatment. But at her first appointment after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the ban in 2023, Edwards said the room felt different, \u201clike there were wires everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like we couldn\u2019t talk about anything really, even the most simple stuff,\u201d she said.",
      "Her mother, Lorena Edwards, said Granados put a \u201ccold stop\u201d to her daughter\u2019s care.",
      "\u201cIt was just: \u2018I don\u2019t provide that care anymore.\u2019 And it was done,\u201d she said.",
      "At the heart of Texas' lawsuits against Granados, Dr. May Lau and Dr. M. Brett Cooper are allegations of prescribing treatment to transition their patients' sex after the ban took effect.",
      "In one instance, the state accuses Granados of prescribing testosterone to a 16-year-old, alleging that although the doctor's records identify the patient as male, the teenager's sex assigned at birth is female. Granados and Lau are also accused of having instructed patients to wait until after the ban was in place to fill prescriptions.",
      "Granados does not dispute that he has continued prescribing puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy. He said those treatments are not for gender transition but for children with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",
      "He said he prescribes testosterone for many reasons, including for patients whose testicles don\u2019t work or had to be removed because of cancer. Others have brain tumors, or surgery or radiation to the brain, that impact puberty. Patients with early onset puberty also need puberty blockers, he said.",
      "Attorneys for Lau said she has always complied with the law and the claims have no merit. Attorneys for Cooper did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is really part of a bigger pattern of extremism within the state that even other states have shied away from replicating,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal for the Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Transgender adults and youth make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at the UCLA School of Law.",
      "Granados' trial has been set for late October; trial dates have not yet been set yet for Lau and Cooper. While the cases are pending, Lau and Cooper agreed to practice medicine only in research and academic settings and not see patients.",
      "Neither Lau or Cooper attended the Wednesday hearing in their cases by a judge who is set to decide where their trials will be held.",
      "Under Texas' ban, the state medical board is instructed to revoke the licenses of doctors who are found to have violated the law.",
      "Lorena Edwards said she watched her daughter thrive during her transition then descend into melancholy as laws targeting transgender rights gained steam.",
      "Emiliana Edwards has switched to receiving treatment in neighboring New Mexico \u2014 where gender-affirming care is legal \u2014 but she said attacks on the transgender community have taken a toll on her mental health.",

      "Greenlanders have been pushed into the global spotlight in the weeks since U.S. President Donald Trump said America could take over their Arctic homeland",
      "NUUK, Greenland -- On a boat, surrounded by snow-covered mountains and icebergs in shades of blue, Qooqu Berthelsen points to the breaking sea ice as a worrisome sign.",
      "Now, though, something is worrying him and many Greenlanders as much as the retreating ice that endangers their livelihood.",
      "\u201cMy concern,\u201d says the 23-year-old hunter, fisher and tour company owner, \u201cis that Trump will come and take Greenland.\u201d",
      "He then repeats what has become a mantra for Greenlanders in the weeks since U.S. President Donald Trump pushed their Arctic homeland into the spotlight by threatening to take it over. That has ignited unprecedented interest in full independence from Denmark \u2014 a key issue in a parliamentary election on March 11.",
      "\u201cGreenlanders don\u2019t want to be Danish. Greenlanders don\u2019t want to be American,\" Berthelsen says.",
      "\u201cGreenland,\u201d he says, \u201cis not for sale.\u201d",
      "You\u2019ll hear this declared all over the land, from the prime minister and university students in Nuuk, the world\u2019s northernmost capital, to hunters and fishermen in sparsely populated villages across the planet's largest island. This is, after all, Kalaallit Nunaat \u2014 Greenlandic for the \u201cLand of the People\u201d or the \u201cLand of the Greenlanders.\u201d",
      "Most of those 57,000 Greenlanders are Indigenous Inuit. They take pride in a culture and traditions that have helped them survive for centuries in exceptionally rugged conditions. In their close link to nature. In belonging to one of the most beautiful, remote, untouched places on Earth.",
      "Many in this semi-autonomous territory are worried and offended by Trump\u2019s threats to seize control of their mineral-rich homeland, even by force, because he says the U.S. needs it \u201cfor national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow can a few words \u2026 change the whole world?\u201d asked Aqqaluk Lynge, a former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council and founder of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party, which governs Greenland. \u201cIt can because he\u2019s playing with fire. We\u2019re seeing another United States here with whole new ideas and wishes.\u201d",
      "Greenland is vital to the world, though much of the world may not realize it. The U.S and other global powers covet its strategic location in the Arctic; its valuable rare earth minerals trapped under the ice needed for telecommunications; its billions of barrels of oil; its potential for shipping and trade routes as that ice keeps retreating because of climate change.",
      "Not even one of Trump\u2019s most fervent fans in Greenland \u2014 who proudly wears a MAGA hat, and a T-shirt emblazoned with Trump pumping his fist and the words: \u201cAmerican Badass\u201d \u2014 wants to be American.",
      "But like other Greenlanders, he wants stronger ties to the U.S. and to open for business beyond Denmark, which colonized them 300 years ago and still exercises control over foreign and defense policy.",
      "\u201cWhen Trump came to office, he wanted to talk to Greenlanders directly without going through Denmark. He wants to negotiate with us and that\u2019s why the Danish are very afraid,\u201d said J\u00f8rgen Boassen, who has visited the White House and welcomed Donald Trump Jr. when he recently visited Nuuk.",
      "The American president's comments set off a political crisis in Denmark. The prime minister went on a tour of European capitals to garner support, saying the continent faced \u201ca more uncertain reality,\u201d while her country moved to strengthen its military presence around Greenland.",
      "For some, it\u2019s been dizzying, a rollercoaster of emotions since Trump\u2019s threats, since his son landed in Nuuk in January in a TRUMP-emblazoned plane and since his father posted on social media: \u201cMAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!\u201d with a message to Greenlanders: \u201cWe\u2019re going to treat you well.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen that was happening, I felt like I was hit in the stomach,\u201d said Qupanuk Olsen, a mining engineer and social media influencer running in the election for the Naleraq party.",
      "Around her, supporters gathered at a bay filled with giant pieces of ice in Nuuk waving the red and white national flag that represents the sun and the ice that covers most of Greenland.",
      "\u201cI could feel that the ground will no longer ever be the same again,\" she said. \"It\u2019s as if we were on sea ice and it started to break, and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d",
      "Journalists from afar have descended on Nuuk, asking locals what they think of Trump\u2019s words. Pro-Trump media influencers known as the Nelk Boys arrived handing out MAGA hats and $100 bills to children in Nuuk\u2019s streets.",
      "\u201cEven though there are strong feelings of sadness, despair, confusion, I think we\u2019re also stronger than ever. We\u2019re fighting it for our people and that gives me hope,\u201d said Aka Hansen, an Inuk filmmaker and writer. She is suspicious of Trump\u2019s intentions but still thanks him for turning the world\u2019s attention to her homeland.",
      "\u201cWe went through all the emotions \u2014 at first very funny, very light, then very serious,\u201d said Hansen, who worked with Conan O\u2019Brien when the comedian came to Nuuk in 2019 to shoot an episode poking fun at Trump\u2019s idea of buying Greenland. \u201cNow, with all the international press that\u2019s been here, we\u2019ve been given a voice that\u2019s being taken seriously.\u201d",
      "Like many other Greenlanders, she doesn\u2019t want to be ruled by another colonial power. But she feels Trump\u2019s rhetoric has increased the momentum for independence from Denmark.",
      "The former colonial ruler is accused of committing abuses against her island\u2019s Inuit people, including removing children from their families in the 1950s with the excuse of integrating them into Danish society and fitting women with intrauterine contraceptive devices in the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 allegedly to limit population growth in Greenland.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a historic moment for Greenland ... compared to two months ago when nobody was talking about independence,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cNow, everybody\u2019s talking about it.\"",
      "A former colony of Denmark, Greenland gained self-rule in 1979 and now runs itself through its parliament. A treaty with the United States, and a U.S. military base in Greenland, also gives Washington say over the territory\u2019s defense.",
      "Greenland is massive \u2014 about one-fifth the size of the United States or three times the size of Texas. Its land mass is in North America, and its Arctic capital city is closer to New York than to Copenhagen.",
      "\u201cDenmark is just a middle man in that whole setup. And we don\u2019t need that middle man anymore,\u201d said Juno Berthelsen, a candidate in the election for Naleraq party. He says Trump has given Greenland leverage to negotiate with Denmark. \u201cOur political goal is to have our own defense agreement, so that we connect directly with the U.S. in terms of defense and security.\u201d",
      "His party, he said, aims to invoke an article in a law that would give Greenland increased autonomy and eventually a path to full independence.",
      "Asked to describe Greenland\u2019s moment, he said: \u201cIf I had to pick one word, it would be exciting. And full of opportunities.\u201d",
      "In his first term in office, Trump began to talk about acquiring Greenland from Denmark, a longtime U.S. ally. Back in 2019, most dismissed it. But it had a ripple effect.",
      "\u201cIt was not taken that seriously back then as it is today. But it was important for Greenland because he, without wanting, did Greenlanders a favor,\u201d said Ebbe Volquardsen, a professor of cultural history at the University of Greenland. \u201cHe underlined the value of being in a union with Greenland.\u201d",
      "Greenland\u2019s economy depends on fisheries and other industries as well as on an annual grant of about $600 million from Denmark. When Trump showed interest in buying Greenland because of its strategic location and mineral resources, he highlighted that annual sum as the amount of what other nations would be willing to pay to have a military or commercial presence in Greenland, Volquardsen said. With that, he gave Greenland leverage for more autonomy and possible reparations for abuses committed by its former colonial ruler.",
      "\u201cThat was important because the narrative in Denmark until that date \u2026 had been that Greenland is receiving this funding as a kind of aid or altruistic gift,\u201d Volquardsen, said.",
      "Life in Nuuk seemed to go on as usual in mid-February, except for a \u201cheat wave.\u201d After weeks of subzero temperatures, it made the capital of Greenland several degrees hotter than Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital.",
      "Large chunks of powder blue ice were blown by winds, blocking boats on the harbor and creating a spectacle for residents who snapped photos under the pink light of a sunset. Some nights, the sky was lit up by spectacular streaks of green and other colors from the northern lights.",
      "You could almost forget that Greenland has become ground zero for a geopolitical showdown \u2014 if, that is, you ignored the front pages of local newspapers featuring images of Trump and the ticker tape in downtown with his name and the Greenlandic word \u201cAmerikamiut.\u201d",
      "On a frigid day, a group of kindergarteners in fluorescent vests walked in line behind their teacher as they crossed a road covered in ice and snow. A few blocks away, teenagers played hockey on a frozen pond.",
      "On a hill next to a statue of the Danish-Norwegian missionary who founded the city in 1721, bells tolled, and a recently married couple laughed as family members threw rice on them for good fortune outside Nuuk\u2019s wooden Lutheran cathedral. More than 90% of Greenlanders identify as Lutherans.",
      "After the wedding ceremony, guests converged at their home for a \u201cKaffemik,\u201d a traditional celebratory gathering where they share coffee and baked goods.",
      "Some Greenlanders say they felt safe while being largely unknown to the world. Now, though, that feeling has dissipated.",
      "Sitting with her husband at a dinner table filled with families chatting and laughing, Tukumminnguaq Olsen Lyberth, said the wave of attention and polarizing comments prompted some friends to delete Facebook accounts.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not use to having this big attention about us, so it\u2019s overwhelming. Before, no one knew about us. Now, it\u2019s a blitz of attention,\u201d said Olsen Lyberth, 37, a cultural history student at the University of Greenland.",
      "\u201cI feel like this is the longest January,\u201d she said jokingly \u2014 in February. \u201cIt\u2019s all of it. Everything feels too overwhelming.\"",

      "In just over a month, President Donald Trump has overturned old certainties about U.S. reliability as a security partner, as he embraces Russia and withdraws American support for Ukraine.",
      "On Monday, Trump ordered a pause to U.S. military supplies to Ukraine as he sought to press President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia, bringing fresh urgency to the EU summit in Brussels.",
      "\u201cEurope faces a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us have seen in our adult lifetime. Some of our fundamental assumptions are being undermined to their very core,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned in a letter to the EU\u2019s 27 leaders, who will consider ways to access more money for defense spending and ease restrictions on it.",
      "But perhaps the biggest challenge for the EU on Thursday will be to take a united stance at a moment when it's fractured, since much of what the bloc does requires unanimous support.",
      "Whatever happens, the meeting is not expected to address Ukraine\u2019s most pressing needs.",
      "It is not aimed at urgently drumming up more arms and ammunition to fill any supply vacuum created by the U.S. freeze. Nor will it unblock the estimated 183 billion euros ($196 billion) in frozen Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house, a pot of ready cash that could be seized.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, meanwhile, are still battling to slow Russia\u2019s advances along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region. Tens of thousands of soldiers and more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed.",
      "The focus of Thursday\u2019s summit will be finances, and how to set the EU up as quickly as possible to provide for its own security, and help Ukraine, while breaking with decades of dependence on the U.S. defense umbrella.",
      "\u201cIn view of the increasing threat situation, it is clear to us that Europe \u2026 must now very quickly make very big efforts, very quickly, to strengthen the defense capability of our country and the European continent,\u201d Germany\u2019s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Tuesday.",
      "The prospective partners in Germany\u2019s next government are seeking to loosen the nation\u2019s rules on running up debt to allow for higher defense spending.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte \u2014 who fears that Russia\u2019s armed forces might be capable of launching an attack on another European country by the end of the decade \u2014 has warned that U.S. allies will have to spend more than 3% of gross domestic product on their military budgets.",
      "The Trump administration is demanding that the Europeans spend as much as 5%, well beyond the NATO benchmark of at least 2%. Seven European allies still fall short of even that target. The U.S. spends around 3.4%, according to NATO figures, and a Pentagon audit that could reduce that is pending.",
      "Von der Leyen has proposed that the EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, raise up to 150 billion euros ($161 billion) on financial markets that would be loaned to member countries buy new military equipment for themselves, or to send to Ukraine.",
      "The commission would also aim to free up funds from other sectors of the bloc\u2019s massive long-term budget and to relax its stringent debt rules so that each country could invest up to 1.5% more of their GDP on defense, should they want to.",
      "The leaders will also discuss whether to place more arms contracts with Ukraine\u2019s defense industry, and to help integrate it into the European industrial network. Production costs in Ukraine are much lower, providing a relatively fast way to supply more arms and ammunition.",
      "It's an approach that Zelenskyy has praised.",
      "\u201cLast year alone, thanks to Ukrainian and partner efforts, we produced over 1.5 million drones of various types. Ukraine is now the world leader in drone warfare. This is our success. But it\u2019s also your success,\u201d he said earlier this month at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "Possible EU support for a future force to police any peace agreement in Ukraine will also be weighed. Britain and France are leading that effort, which could involve several other European countries.",
      "The summit comes as the EU is arguably at its weakest point, fragmented by the steady rise of a hard right that is often pro-Russian.",
      "Hungary and Slovakia have routinely undermined support for Ukraine. Hungary is threatening to veto a joint statement drafted for Thursday\u2019s summit but would not be able to block any major security or financing decisions.",
      "Meanwhile, many larger countries face uncertainties at home. Germany will soon have a new chancellor, but France\u2019s latest government is fragile, and Spain relies on small parties to keep its coalition intact.",
      "Poland offers strong leadership under Prime Minister Donald Tusk, however a presidential election looms and a right-wing candidate is well placed. The Dutch cabinet dominated by hard-right leader Geert Wilders is shaky."

      "JERUSALEM -- Israel\u2019s cutoff of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza\u2019s 2 million people has sent prices soaring and humanitarian groups into overdrive trying to distribute dwindling stocks to the most vulnerable.",
      "The aid freeze has imperiled the tenuous progress aid workers say they have made to stave off famine over the past six weeks during Phase 1 of the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed to in January.",
      "After more than 16 months of war, Gaza\u2019s population is entirely dependent on trucked-in food and other aid. Most are displaced from their homes, and many need shelter. Fuel is needed to keep hospitals, water pumps, bakeries and telecommunications \u2014 as well as trucks delivering aid \u2014 operating.",
      "Israel says the siege aims at pressuring Hamas to accept its spinoff ceasefire proposal. Israel has delayed moving to the second phase of the deal it reached with Hamas, during which the flow of aid was supposed to continue. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he is prepared to raise the pressure and would not rule out cutting off all electricity to Gaza if Hamas doesn\u2019t budge. Rights groups have called the cutoff a \u201cstarvation policy.\u201d",
      "Two days in, how is the cutoff impacting Gaza on the ground?",
      "There\u2019s no major stockpile of tents in Gaza for Palestinians to rely on during the aid freeze, said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council. The aid that came in during the ceasefire\u2019s first phase was \u201cnowhere near enough to address all of the needs,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIf it was enough, we wouldn\u2019t have had infants dying from exposure because of lack of shelter materials and warm clothes and proper medical equipment to treat them,\u201d she said.",
      "Six infants in the Gaza Strip died from hypothermia during Phase 1.",
      "Aid groups are now trying to assess what stocks they do have in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out, what do we have? What would be the best use of our supply?\" said Jonathan Crikx, a spokesperson for UNICEF. \"We never sat on supplies, so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a huge amount left to distribute.\u201d",
      "He predicted a \u201ccatastrophic result\u201d if the freeze continues.",
      "During the ceasefire's first phase, humanitarian agencies rushed in supplies and quickly ramped up their capabilities. Aid workers set up more food kitchens, health centers and water distribution points. With more fuel coming in, they were able to double the amount of water drawn from wells, according to the U.N. humanitarian coordination agency, or OCHA.",
      "The United Nations and associated nongovernmental organizations brought in around 100,000 tents as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians tried to return to their homes, only to find them destroyed or too damaged to live in.",
      "But the progress relied on the flow of aid continuing.",
      "The International Organization for Migration now has 22,500 tents sitting in its warehouses in Jordan, after supply trucks brought back their undelivered cargo once entry was barred, said Karl Baker, the agency's regional crisis coordinator.",
      "The International Rescue Commission has 6.7 tons (14,771 pounds) of medicines and medical supplies waiting to enter Gaza, the delivery of which is now \u201chighly uncertain,\u201d said Bob Kitchen, vice president of the Emergencies and Humanitarian Action Department.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s imperative that aid access is now immediately resumed. With humanitarian needs sky high, more aid access is required, not less,\u201d Kitchen said.",
      "The U.N.\u2019s humanitarian office said Tuesday that prices of vegetables and flour shot up after the crossings closed.",
      "Sayed Mohamed al-Dairi walked through a bustling market in Gaza City just after the cutoff was announced. Prices that had just started to come down during the ceasefire had jumped back up, as sellers hiked the prices of their dwindling wares.",
      "\u201cThe traders are massacring us, the traders are not merciful to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the morning, the price of sugar was 5 shekels, ask him now, the price has become 10 shekels.\u201d",
      "In the central Gaza city of Deir Al-Balah, one cigarette priced at 5 shekels ($1.37) before the cutoff now stands at 20 shekels ($5.49). One kilo of chicken (2.2 pounds) that was 21 shekels ($5.76) is now 50 shekels. ($13.72). Cooking gas has soared even more, from 90 shekels ($24.70) for 12 kilos (26.4 pounds) to 1,480 shekels ($406.24).",
      "Following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, Israel cut off all aid to Gaza for two weeks \u2014 a measure central to South Africa\u2019s case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice. That took place as Israel launched the most intense phase of its aerial bombardment campaign on Gaza, one of the most aggressive in modern history.",
      "With the ceasefire expiring and aid again frozen, Palestinians fear a repeat of that period.",
      "\u201cWe are afraid that Netanyahu or Trump will launch a war more severe than the previous war,\u201d said Abeer Obeid, a Palestinian woman from northern Gaza.",
      "\u201cThe crossings are the means by which people obtain the basic necessities of life, why are they closing them,\" she asked. \"For the extension of the truce, they must find any other solution.\u201d",

A branch of the pipeline, which continues as IKL through Germany, serves the Czech Republic, or Czechia.",

      "LONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Wednesday praised the hundreds of British troops who died fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq \u201calongside our allies,\u201d in an oblique rebuke of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who has questioned the merits of a potential European peacekeeping force in Ukraine following the signing of any peace agreement between the country and Russia.",
      "In his opening remarks before the start of a weekly parliamentary question session, Starmer specifically paid tribute to six British soldiers who died on patrol in Afghanistan when their vehicle was struck by an explosive. Thursday marks the 13-year anniversary of their deaths.",
      "\u201cThese men fought and died for their country, our country,\" Starmer told the House of Commons. \u201cAnd across the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 642 individuals died fighting for Britain alongside our allies, many more were wounded.\u201d",
      "Without directly referencing Vance, the prime minister said he and all lawmakers will \u201cnever forget their bravery and their sacrifice.\u201d",
      "Vance said in an interview with Fox News this week that an economic pact with Kyiv sought by President Donald Trump \u201cis a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn\u2019t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d",
      "Though Vance has subsequently sought to head off criticism by noting that he did not specifically name any countries, his \u201crandom country\u201d comment prompted anger, particularly in the U.K. and France.",
      "British troops fought alongside the U.S. in Afghanistan and Iraq in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S., while French troops were deployed to Afghanistan though not during the 2003 U.S.-led war in Iraq.",
      "Both Starmer, who has been careful not to criticize Trump over the past few days of frantic diplomacy, and French President Emmanuel Macron, have said that they are ready to deploy troops in a peacekeeping capacity in Ukraine after any peace deal, but have said that they would require further support from the U.S.",
      "No other countries have yet indicated they will be sending troops to any peacekeeping mission.",
      "Trump has offered no U.S. security guarantee and has, like Vance, indicated that an economic deal with Ukraine, that sees American money and people in the country but no forces, would be enough to fend off any future attack by Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "In his overnight address to Congress, Trump appeared to soften his tone with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following last Friday's fractious meeting in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy had been expected to sign off on a minerals deal, intended in part to pay back the U.S. for aid it has sent Kyiv since the start of the war. But that plan was scrapped as the visit was ended abruptly after their meeting.",

The Pentagon and many experts say China's total spending on defense may be 40% higher or more because of items included under other budgets.",

      "Ukrainian forces are toiling to slow advances by the bigger Russian army along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region. The Russian onslaught, which has been costly for its troops, hasn\u2019t yet brought a strategically significant breakthrough for the Kremlin.

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis has stabilized enough after two respiratory crises to be taken off noninvasive mechanical ventilation and resume receiving just high flows of supplemental oxygen via a nasal tube to help him breathe, the Vatican says",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis had stabilized enough Tuesday after two respiratory crises to be taken off noninvasive mechanical ventilation and receive just high flows of supplemental oxygen, as he continued his more than two-week long fight against double pneumonia, the Vatican said.",
      "Francis, 88, woke up and was resuming respiratory physiotherapy after sleeping through the night, the Vatican said.",
      "The Vatican said as of Tuesday morning, Francis no longer needed to wear the mechanical ventilation mask that covers his nose and mouth to pump oxygen into his lungs and was just receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal tube.",
      "He had to resume using the mask on Monday after suffering two respiratory crises that required doctors to extract \u201ccopious\u201d amounts of mucus from his lungs. Doctors performed two bronchoscopies, in which a camera-tipped tube was sent into his airways with a sucker at the tip to suction out fluid.",
      "The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, remained alert, oriented and cooperated with medical personnel, the Vatican said. The prognosis remained guarded, meaning he was not out of danger. Doctors didn\u2019t say if he remained in stable condition, though they referred to the crises in the past tense.",
      "The fact that Francis no longer needed the ventilation mask by Tuesday morning was a sign that he had stabilized some after the crises, but still within what doctors have said was a complex respiratory picture.",
      "The crises were a new setback in what has become a more than two-week battle by the frail pope to overcome a complex respiratory infection.",
      "The Vatican said the mucus that had accumulated in Francis' lungs was his body\u2019s reaction to the original pneumonia infection and not a new infection, given laboratory tests don\u2019t indicate any new bacteria.",
      "Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episodes were more concerning than the last one on Friday, in which Francis had a coughing fit, inhaled some vomit that needed to be extracted, was put on the noninvasive mechanical ventilation for a day and then didn\u2019t need it anymore.",
      "The use of bronchoscopies reflects a worrying level of mucus and phlegm in the lungs, Coleman said. \u201cThe fact that they had to go in there and remove it manually is concerning, because it means that he is not clearing the secretions on his own,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s taking little steps forward and then steps back,\u201d said Coleman, who is not involved in Francis\u2019 care.",
      "Francis, who is not physically active, uses a wheelchair and is overweight, had been undergoing respiratory physiotherapy to try to improve his lung function. But the accumulation of the secretions in his lungs was a sign that he doesn\u2019t have the muscle tone to cough vigorously enough to expel the fluid.",
      "Doctors often use noninvasive ventilation to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Francis has not been intubated during this hospitalization. It\u2019s not clear if he has provided any advance directives about the limits of his care if he declines or loses consciousness.",
      "Catholic teaching holds that life must be defended from conception until natural death. It insists that chronically ill patients, including those in vegetative states, must receive \u201cordinary\u201d care such as hydration and nutrition, but \u201cextraordinary\u201d or disproportionate care can be suspended if it is no longer beneficial or is only prolonging a precarious and painful life.",
      "Francis articulated that in a 2017 speech to a meeting of the Vatican\u2019s bioethics think tank, the Pontifical Academy for Life. He said there was \u201cno obligation to have recourse in all circumstances to every possible remedy.\u201d He added: \u201cIt thus makes possible a decision that is morally qualified as withdrawal of \u2018overzealous treatment.\u2019\u201d",
      "Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who heads the academy which helps articulate the Catholic Church\u2019s position on end-of-life care, said Francis is like any other Catholic and would follow church teaching if it came to that.",
      "\u201cToday the pope is giving us an extraordinary teaching on fragility,\u201d he told reporters Monday. \u201cToday the pope, not through words but with his body, is reminding all of us, we elderly people to begin with, that we are all fragile and therefore we need to take care of each other.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 hospitalization, which hits 18 nights Tuesday, is by no means reaching the papal record that was set during St. John Paul II\u2019s numerous lengthy hospitalizations over a quarter century. The longest single hospitalization occurred in 1981, when John Paul spent 55 days in Gemelli for a minor operation and then to be treated for a serious infection that followed.",

      "St. Francis is the medieval Catholic saint whose spirituality focused on loving the poor, creation, and peace",
      "ASSISI, Italy -- As Pope Francis entered his third week in a hospital battling pneumonia, hundreds of pilgrims continued to make their way to this hilltop town to pray at the tomb of St. Francis, the hometown medieval saint whom the pontiff chose as his papal name.",
      "Groups from the United States, Ukraine and all over Italy made their way through a town of grey and brown stone houses that look little changed from when the saint was born here more than 840 years ago.",
      "They said they were inspired by St. Francis\u2019 love for the poor, peace and creation \u2014 all priorities for the pope, too, and the Franciscans, one of the largest orders in the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cThe life of St. Francis teaches the way to holiness is giving up yourself, getting rid of things that hold us back in our life here, and just offer ourselves to the Lord,\u201d said the Rev. Paul Vu, who was visiting in early March with a group of 50 Vietnamese-American parishioners from Santa Ana, California.",
      "In 1182, Francis was born to a wealthy family in Assisi, which rises above a fertile valley in central Italy. Praying in front of a crucifix, he heard a call to reform the church. He aspired to strip everything down to the essentials in the service of God.",
      "The Santuario della Spogliazione, which literally means stripping, is a sober stone church on the hillside. It marks the spot where he gave up even his clothes in front of his father, who disinherited him. St. Francis was accepted into the church by the bishop as an advocate of the poor and went on to found a religious order that\u2019s still active globally today, the Franciscans.",
      "For Assisi\u2019s current bishop, the Rev. Domenico Sorrentino, St. Francis\u2019 renunciation of material encumbrances also signaled his love of creation and of peace.",
      "\u201cFrancis, stripping himself, came back to nature in some sense. So we must receive nature as a gift of God, and respect this gift,\u201d Sorrentino told The Associated Press.",
      "During the Crusades, St. Francis befriended a Muslim sultan \u2014 their exchanges are still seen as an example of the kind of interfaith dialogue that St. John Paul II promoted by gathering leaders of the major global religions in Assisi during his papacy.",
      "\u201cAssisi is the place to pray for peace in the world and inside of ourselves,\u201d said Elizabeth Nu\u00f1ez, a Passionist sister from Colombia who was there in pilgrimage on a recent weekend.",
      "After being elected, a pope chooses a name to adopt for his papacy. Jorge Mario Bergoglio picked Francis in 2013.",
      "\u201cHe explained it in a very simple way, that he chose Francis\u2019 name because he\u2019s the man of peace, of the poor, of brotherhood. The man who loves and respects creation,\u201d said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who spent 30 years in Assisi and now leads the Vatican\u2019s committee on World Children\u2019s Day. \u201cIt\u2019s a name that contains a life program.\u201d",
      "Several of the pope\u2019s encyclicals \u2014 teaching documents for the church \u2014 pulled from Franciscan themes and quotes, including one about building a more inclusive church.",
      "This year will mark the 800th anniversary of St. Francis\u2019 celebrated \u201ccanticle of creatures,\u201d where he praises God for the sun, the moon and other natural elements he refers to as brothers and sisters.",
      "Pope Francis used its title for an encyclical highlighting the importance of taking care of the environment because it\u2019s a gift from God that humankind only gets to protect, not exploit.",
      "Dora Pell, a 75-year-old pilgrim from England, went walking in the woods around Assisi beloved by St. Francis and called it as moving as sitting by his tomb in the Basilica of St. Francis on the edge of town.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a spirituality that\u2019s based on love and inclusiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s seeing Christ everywhere, in everything and everybody.\u201d",
      "The basilica contains a cycle of more than two dozen frescoes illustrating crucial moments in St. Francis\u2019 life \u2014 including the \u201cspogliazione.\u201d",
      "Painted by Giotto at the end of the 13th century, they marked a turning point in Western art. Their realism and careful rendering of space and depth went far beyond what was common in the Middle Ages and presaged the Renaissance.",
      "They were spared destruction in the 1997 earthquake that hit the region, killing four people in the basilica itself.",
      "Across town is the Basilica di Santa Chiara, dedicated to St. Clare, who embraced radical poverty to imitate St. Francis. He made available to her and the growing group of women following her a local church \u2014 the beginning of the Poor Clares order, now present in 70 countries with 20,000 sisters.",
      "In between the two churches, in the Santuario della Spogliazione, lies the Blessed Carlo Acutis, an Italian teen who died in 2006 and will become the church\u2019s first millennial saint when canonized in April.",
      "That makes Assisi \u201ca condensation of holiness in a small town,\u201d Fortunato said. And it all links back to St. Francis\u2019 choice 800 years ago.",
      "\u201cIn the end, Francis is pure Gospel. He\u2019s the good news,\u201d Fortunato said.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A Philippine fighter jet with two pilots on board has lost contact during a night combat assault in support of ground forces battling communist insurgents in a southern province, and an extensive search is underway, officials said Tuesday.",
      "The FA-50 jet lost communication during the mission with other air force aircraft around midnight Monday before reaching a target area. The other aircraft were able to return safely to an air base in central Cebu province after carrying out assaults, the air force said without providing other details for security reasons.",
      "A Philippine military official told The Associated Press that the incident happened in a southern province, where a counterinsurgency mission against New People's Army guerrillas was underway. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive situation publicly.",
      "\"We are hopeful of locating them and the aircraft soon and ask you to join us in prayer during this critical time,\u201d air force spokesperson Col. Ma. Consuelo Castillo said.",
      "The pilots could eject from the supersonic jets in case they encounter any problem that could lead to a crash. Rescuers could locate them if their emergency locating transmitters emitted signals.",
      "Castillo refused to say if rescuers have detected such signals but added that the military is \u201cstill very optimistic that they are safe.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear if the rest of the FA-50s would be grounded following the incident.",
      "The Philippines acquired 12 FA-50s multi-purpose fighter jets starting in 2015 from South Korea\u2019s Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. The 18.9 billion peso ($331 million) contract had been the biggest under a military modernization program that has been repeatedly stalled by a lack of funds. The Philippines plans to acquire another 12 fighter jets from South Korea.",
      "The military estimates about 1,000 communist guerrillas remain after decades of battle setbacks, surrenders and factional fighting. Peace talks brokered by Norway collapsed under previous President Rodrigo Duterte after both sides accused the other of continuing deadly attacks despite the negotiations.",
      "In 2023, the government and the communist rebels agreed to resume talks aimed at ending one of Asia\u2019s longest insurgencies. But the talks still have not restarted under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.",
      "Aside from anti-insurgency operations, the jets have been used in a range of activities, from major national ceremonies to patrolling the disputed South China Sea."

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is granting a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers, amid fears that the trade war could harm U.S. manufacturers.",
      "The announcement comes after Trump spoke with leaders of the \u201cbig 3\u201d automakers, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis on Wednesday. Trump also said he told the automaker chief executives that they should move production to the U.S from Canada and Mexico, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\u201cWe spoke with the big three auto dealers,\u201d Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \u201cWe are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\u201d referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.\"",
      "Trump's press secretary said the president is open to hearing about additional exemptions but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is not willing to lift Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves any tariffs on Canada, a senior government official told The Associated Press. The official confirmed the stance on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.",
      "\"\u201cBoth countries will continue to be in contact today,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s office said.",

      "\u201cPeople are going to lose their jobs,\u201d he said.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick earlier said there might be carveouts coming to the 25% tariffs placed on Canada and Mexico.",
      "But, Trump's tariffs have stirred up bad blood among allies who see his aggression on trade as misguided, with Canada suggesting it will reject any offer to water down the day-old tariffs. The trade war is not necessarily a brief skirmish as the White House maintains that even harsher taxes on imports are coming in April, even as businesses and consumers worry that rising costs will crush economic growth, worsen inflation and result in layoffs.",
      "Still, the administration is grappling with the fallout of tariff that could create serious blowback for his political mandate to lower prices. Trump has acknowledged that his tariffs could cause some financial pain, yet he has repeatedly said the tariffs will lead to more domestic investment and factory work.",
      "In a Wednesday interview with Bloomberg Television, Lutnick said that Trump would update his tariff plans with an afternoon announcement, possibly sparing sectors such as autos from the import taxes.",
      "On April 2, Trump plans to announce what he calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs to match the tariffs, taxes and subsidies provided by other countries. That could dramatically increase the tariff rates charged globally while maintaining the risk of a broader tariff.",
      "Lutnick said he would talk on Wednesday morning with Trump about the possible options regarding Canada and Mexico, saying that both countries are working to address the U.S. president's concerns about drug trafficking. Lutnick said to expect Trump to announce his decision Wednesday afternoon.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump put 25% taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada, taxing Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity at a lower 10% rate. The president also doubled the 10% tariff he placed on China to 20%. The administration has said the tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of drugs such as fentanyl, but Trump also suggested that the tariffs are about getting rid of persistent U.S. trade deficits.",
      "The taxes almost immediately triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday. The U.S. stock market has given up all of the gains since Trump's victory in last year's presidential election and consumers are already exhausted by inflation and worried the costs of the tax hike would lead to higher prices. Those concerns may have prompted Lutnick to signal a possible retreat in a Tuesday afternoon interview with the Fox Business Network.",
      "The U.S. president tried to play down the possible economic harm as \u201ca little disturbance,\u201d as the administration has suggested that the estimates of higher inflation and slower growth in most outside economic forecasts are overblown.",
      "\u201cIt may be a little bit of an adjustment period,\u201d he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. \u201cYou have to bear with me again and this will be even better.\u201d",
      "Trump also said in his speech that he spoke on Tuesday with \u201call three, the top people\u201d at the major U.S. automakers and \u201cthey're so excited.\u201d The big three automakers are General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep. The domestic auto sector would be especially vulnerable to tariffs as it depends on Mexico and Canada as part of its supply chains.",
      "Trudeau said on Tuesday that his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days, stressing that the United States had abandoned a long-standing friendship.",
      "\u201cToday, the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\u201d Trudeau said on Tuesday.",
      "Mexico indicated it would announce its own countermeasures on Sunday.",
      "Beijing responded with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.",
      "\u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end,\u201d China\u2019s embassy to the United States posted on X on Tuesday night.",
      "In response to China, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that the United States is \u201cprepared\u201d for war against the world's second largest economy.",

    "story": [
      "China is keeping its economic growth target at \u201caround 5%\u201d for 2025 despite a looming trade war with the United States and other headwinds",
      "BEIJING -- The Chinese government unveiled an annual economic growth target of \u201caround 5%\u201d on Wednesday, despite the possible negative impact of a looming trade war with the United States, and pledged to address what it called \u201csluggish\u201d consumer spending at home.",
      "The target was announced at the opening session of the annual meeting of China's legislature. It's the same as for the last two years but will likely be more difficult to achieve because of the new, higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese products and other economic headwinds. The use of \u201caround\u201d gives the government some room if growth falls short.",
      "The target signals the government's intention to try to stabilize growth in challenging economic times but hold back on more dramatic action that some economists say is needed to supercharge it.",
      "The government also said in a draft budget released Wednesday that defense spending would rise 7.2% this year to 1.78 trillion yuan ($245 billion), second only to the United States.",
      "It released the growth target in a separate report, parts of which were presented to the nearly 3,000 members of the National People's Congress by Premier Li Qiang. It acknowledged both international and domestic challenges.",
      "\u201cAn increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science, and technology,\u201d the report said, without specifics. \u201cUnilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.\u201d",
      "It added: \u201cDomestically, the foundation for China\u2019s sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough. Effective demand is weak, and consumption, in particular, is sluggish.\u201d",
      "The International Monetary Fund has projected that China's economy will grow 4.6% this year, down from 5% in 2024, according to Chinese government statistics.",
      "The new report placed more emphasis on reviving domestic demand and consumption than last year's, echoing a shift by the ruling Communist Party at meetings in December. It said the government should \u201cmake domestic demand the main engine and anchor of economic growth.\u201d",
      "The report added that \u201cachieving this year's targets will not be easy, and we must make arduous efforts to meet them.\u201d",
      "Across-the-board 20% tariffs imposed this week on Chinese products by U.S. President Donald Trump pose the latest threat to an economy already weighed down by a prolonged real estate slump and sluggish consumer spending and private business investment. The tariffs could crimp sales to one of China\u2019s major export markets, making the need to boost domestic demand more urgent.",
      "The new report offered some details on the party's plans for a \u201cmore proactive fiscal policy,\u201d including a rise in the government budget deficit from 3% to 4% of GDP, or the size of the overall economy. It also reiterated the party\u2019s announcement in December that the central bank would shift its monetary policy from \u201cprudent\u201d to \u201cmoderately loose\u201d for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "The government will issue 1.3 trillion yuan ($180 billion) in ultra-long term bonds, up from 1 trillion yuan last year, the report said. Of that, 300 billion yuan would go toward a program launched last year that offers rebates to consumers who trade in automobiles or appliances for new ones, doubling central government support for the program.",
      "Economists expressed doubts over whether the policies will do enough, noting that the government reduced its inflation target to 2% from 3% last year, and suggesting leaders have accepted that the economy is still mired in deflation, or a cycle of weakening prices.",
      "The degree of support is \u201cmore modest than it may appear,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. \u201cWe remain skeptical that it will be sufficient to prevent growth from slowing this year, especially given the headwinds on the external front and the lack of a more pronounced shift in government spending toward support for consumption.\u201d",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping also wants to wean the economy off its long-running dependence on the highly indebted real estate market.",
      "He is directing economic resources into developing a more innovative, high-tech economy \u2014 and with growing restrictions on U.S. technology exports to China, one that isn't beholden to other countries for the most powerful semiconductors and other electronic components.",
      "Xi told delegates from Jiangsu province, one of China's wealthier coastal provinces known for exports, on Wednesday that \u201ctechnological innovation and industrial innovation are the basic paths to developing new quality productivity.\u201d",
      "He also referred to a meeting in February with the heads of China's top private companies, and said the province should \u201ctreat all types of enterprises equally, and continuously optimize the business environment.\u201d",
      "The push towards developing a high-tech economy has been a long-term economic goal of the Communist Party, though it has enacted measures since September that suggest a shift in emphasis toward shoring up growth in the short term.",
      "The new report highlighted artificial intelligence in a section on fostering \u201cindustries of the future,\u201d saying the government would support the application of large-scale AI models, smart manufacturing equipment, connected vehicles and intelligent robots."

      "The two political parties expected to form the next German government have agreed to significantly loosen the country\u2019s constitutional restriction on deficits, enabling 1 trillion euros ($1.08 trillion) or more in new borrowing and spending on defense ...",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The two political parties expected to form the next German government have agreed to loosen the country's constitution restrictions on borrowing, enabling 1 trillion euros ($1.08 trillion) or more in spending on defense and infrastructure.",
      "It\u2019s a major change in Germany\u2019s debt-averse political culture, rejecting conventional economic wisdom that long dominated Europe\u2019s biggest economy and one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries.",
      "Here are key facts about the debt brake and what the changes will mean for Germany and Europe.",
      "The debt brake was passed in 2009, when a global financial crisis led to sharp increase in government borrowing in Germany and around the world. The debt brake also reflected cultural and political skepticism about debt in general that for years left a deep imprint on German politics.",
      "The debt brake limited new borrowing to 0.35% of gross domestic product - a tight limit when compared to European Union budget rules requiring less than 3%, and the 2024 U.S. federal deficit of 6.4%.",
      "The debt brake appeared to work fine for years - until it didn't. German governments lived within the limits during the good times in the 2010s, often running small surpluses.",
      "But the pandemic, slowing growth and Russia's invasion of Ukraine put the debt brake under severe strain.",
      "The government had to invoke an emergency clause to borrow and spend more on pandemic relief for businesses in 2020. Then it declared another emergency in 2021, and another one in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised pressure for more defense spending and relief for utility customers. Yet another emergency exemption was used in 2023. However in late 2023 the Federal Constitutional Court ruled the government had gone too far in fudging the debt limit, forcing a frantic rewrite of the 2024 budget.",
      "Then Social Democrat Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government collapsed in November 2024 over disagreement with a coalition party, the pro-business Free Democrats, over spending and the debt brake.",
      "The reformed debt brake would remove the constitutional ceiling when it comes to defense spending. That would support efforts to build up Germany\u2019s own defenses and its ability to further support Ukraine. Germany is already a leading backer of Ukraine, sending 60 Leopard tanks and 175 Marder infantry fighting vehicles as well as 27 air defense systems, including three of its U.S.-made Patriot missile batteries.",
      "\u201cThe extra room for defence spending sends a clear signal to Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump as well as to Germany\u2019s European friends that Germany is serious about defending itself and helping Ukraine,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.",
      "\u201cGermany is finally taking on the leadership role which, given its size and its fiscal space, it should have assumed years ago.\u201d",
      "Leaders of the conservative Union bloc agreed with the center-left Social Democrats to exempt military spending over 1% of GDP from the debt limit, as well as a 500 billion euro infrastructure fund for civil and disaster protection, transport infrastructure, hospitals, energy infrastructure, education, scientific research and digitization. Economists estimate that the measure, if passed, could enable a trillion euros in new borrowing and spending over a decade.",
      "The agreement came during talks aimed at forming a coalition government between the two parties.",
      "It was a sharp turnaround for Friedrich Merz, who as Union leader is the likely next chancellor after his party came in first in national elections on Feb. 23. His party program rejected changes to the debt brake, though he had indicated he might be open to negotiation on that point.",
      "The move \u201cfollows the old political principle: if the facts change, I change my mind,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING bank.",
      "The agreement reflects both long-term strains on the debt brake, and the sudden recent shift in U.S. security policy under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has demanded that Europe do more for own security, disrupting the post-World War II transatlantic alliance under which Europe looked to the U.S. as an ultimate security guarantor.",
      "Trump's public disparagement of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and decision to suspend military aid to Ukraine have shocked European governments into facing the need for vastly more defense spending to fill the gap left by a U.S. seen as no longer committed to Europe's security.",
      "Germany only met the NATO requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense through a 100 billion-euro special fund exempted from the debt brake in 2022 - but that fund will run out in 2027.",
      "The parties plan to rush the changes through the lame duck parliament next week. That's because mainstream parties have the needed two-thirds majority in the old parliament - but will lose that in the new parliament due to electoral gains by the far-right Alternative for Germany and the far-left The Left party who oppose the changes.",
      "The measure would still need votes in the outgoing parliament from the environmentalist Greens, who weren't part of the coalition talks.",
      "Economists say the looser debt brake could help Germany emerge from five years of economic stagnation by increasing spending on things that promote economic activity over the long term. Skimping on infrastructure spending has been blamed for trains that don't run on time due to endless track repairs, crumbling bridges, declining educational achievement levels, and lagging adoption of renewable energy infrastructure and digital technology.",
      "The morning after the announcement, economists started tearing up old growth forecasts and raising their outlook. Morgan Stanley saw the possibility of 0.2% more GDP growth this year and 0.7% more next year. That would be welcome in an economy that shrank for the past two years.",
      "\u201cEverything you thought you knew about Germany\u2019s economic prospects three months ago, or even three weeks ago, should be ripped up,\u201d said Jim Reid, research strategist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThis is game-changing if it goes through.\u201d",
      "The step is a \u201csea change\u201d in German policy, said economist Schmieding.",
      "\u201cThe infrastructure fund signals that the new government will seriously tackle key domestic deficiencies,\u201d Schmieding said. \u201cI look forward to the day in the \u2013 probably still somewhat distant \u2013 future when German trains may run as fast and punctual as those in France, Switzerland or Austria.\u201d"

      "A Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its controlling stake in a subsidiary that operates ports near the Panama Canal to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control after President Donald Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt.",
      "The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, as well as others in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The transaction, which must be approved by Panama's government, does not include any interest in a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China.",
      "Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter \u201cfoolishly\u201d gave the canal away.",
      "Trump and his supporters have also complained about the fees that ships are charged to use the waterway and alleged that China has been operating the canal, an assertion denied by Panama's government.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \u201cgive China ready observation posts\u201d to take action. \u201cThis situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\u201d Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",

      "But while much attention was focused on Trump\u2019s threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the ports key ports at either end of the canal.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway.

      "\u201cI would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,\" Sixt said.",
      "In addition to BlackRock, a New York-based global investment management company with $11.6 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, the consortium includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited.",
      "BlackRock declined to comment outside of a press release touting the deal. Shares in BlackRock fell 1.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday."

      "NUUK, Greenland -- NUUK, Greenland (AP) \u2014 Greenland\u2019s prime minister has a message for President Donald Trump: \u201cGreenland is ours.\u201d",
      "M\u00fate Bourup Egede made the statement on Facebook Wednesday, just hours after Trump declared in his speech to a joint session of Congress that he intends to gain control of Greenland \u201cone way or the other.\u201d",
      "\u201cKalaallit Nunaat is ours,\u201d Egede said in the post, using the Greenlandic name for his country.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be Americans, nor Danes; We are Kalaallit. The Americans and their leader must understand that. We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,\u201d he said. The post ended with a clenched fist emoji and a Greenlandic flag.",
      "On the streets of Nuuk, Greenland\u2019s capital, where the temperature was 4 degrees blow zero (minus 20 Celsius) at midday Wednesday and the bright sunshine reflected blindingly off a layer of fresh-fallen snow, people are taking Trump\u2019s designs on their country seriously.",
      "Since taking office six weeks ago, Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in Greenland, a huge mineral-rich island that sits along strategic sea lanes in the North Atlantic. Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark with a population of about 56,000 people, lies off the northeastern coast of Canada, closer to Washington, D.C., than to Copenhagen.",
      "Trump made a direct appeal to Greenlanders in his speech to Congress, just a week before the country\u2019s voters cast their ballots in parliamentary elections.",
      "\u201cWe strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cWe will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before,\u201d he added.",
      "But Trump\u2019s message came with undertones of the great power politics that have marked the early days of his second administration. Since taking office, Trump has suggested moving Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and turning it into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East;\u201d announced his intention to regain control of the Panama Canal; and stopped arms deliveries to Ukraine after the country\u2019s president was slow to endorse Washington\u2019s roadmap for a peace deal with Russia.",
      "Trump said his administration was \u201cworking with everybody involved to try to get\u201d Greenland.",
      "\u201cWe need it really for international world security. And I think we\u2019re going to get it. One way or the other, we\u2019re going to get it,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Lisa Aardestrup, an 18-year-old language student, wasn\u2019t interested in Trump\u2019s sales pitch as she stepped carefully off a bus and onto an icy street on her way to class Wednesday morning.",
      "She\u2019s concerned that becoming part of the United States would damage Greenland\u2019s environment and the fishing industry, which accounts for about 90% of the country\u2019s exports, while fueling inflation and higher taxes.",
      "\u201cWe feel like it\u2019s a bad idea, and we just more want to be like our little island that\u2019s more independent than anything else,\u201d Aardestrup said.",
      "\u201cGreenland is very independent,\u201d she added.",
      "Aardestrup is also worried about importing the school shootings, angry politics and homelessness that dominate the news from the U.S. She fears that would threaten Greenland\u2019s culture, which she learned about from the stories her parents told her.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great people here,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, you create very lovely and longstanding friendships. And I think that\u2019s what I love about Greenland so much.\u201d",
      "Greenlanders voted overwhelmingly in favor of self-government in a 2009 referendum that also established a pathway to independence whenever the people of the island support such a move. Under the terms of that referendum, Denmark remains responsible for Greenland\u2019s defense and foreign affairs, with the local government controlling other matters.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s comments, Denmark\u2019s foreign minister said he didn\u2019t think Greenlanders wanted to separate from Denmark only to become \u201can integrated part of America.\u201d",
      "Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen said he believed Trump\u2019s reference to respecting Greenlanders\u2019 right to self-determination was the most important part of his speech.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic about what will be a Greenlandic decision about this,\u201d he said during a trip to Finland. \u201cThey want to loosen their ties to Denmark. We\u2019re working on that, to have a more equal relationship.\u201d",
      "L\u00f8kke added that it was important for next week\u2019s elections to be free and fair \u201cwithout any kind of international intervention.\u201d",
      "While opinion polls suggest most Greenlanders don\u2019t want to become part of the U.S., not everyone agrees.",
      "Yulao Sandkreen is thrilled with the notion that Trump might offer Greenlanders a chance to be part of the United States.",
      "Standing outside a supermarket with a coffee and cigarette in hand, Sandkreen, who had a relative who worked with the U.S. Coast Guard, focused on the advantages that could come with tighter bonds with the United States.",
      "\u201cWe need McDonald's,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe need everything.\u2019\u2019",

      "Google is updating its ubiquitous search engine with the next generation of its artificial intelligence technology as part of an effort to provide instant expertise amid intensifying competition from smaller competitors.",
      "The company announced Wednesday that it will feed its Gemini 2.0 AI model into its search engine so it can field more complex questions involving subjects such as computer coding and math.",
      "As has been the case since last May, the AI-generated overviews will be placed above the traditional web links that have become the lifeblood of online publishers dependent on traffic referrals from Google's dominant search engine.",
      "Google is broadening the audience for AI overviews in the U.S. by making them available to teenage searchers without requiring them to go through a special sign-in process to see them.",
      "The stage is also being set for what could turn out to be one of the most dramatic changes to the search engine's interface since Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started the company in a Silicon Valley garage during the late 1990s.",
      "Google is going to begin a gradual rollout of an \u201cAI mode\u201d option that will result in the search engine generating even more AI overviews. When search is in AI mode, Google is warning the overviews are likely to become more conversational and sometimes head down online corridors that result in falsehoods that the tech industry euphemistically calls \u201challucinations.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs with any early-stage AI product, we won\u2019t always get it right,\u201d Google product vice president Robby Stein wrote in a blog post that also acknowledged the possibility \u201cthat some responses may unintentionally appear to take on a persona or reflect a particular opinion.\u201d",
      "More stringent guardrails are supposed to be in place to prevent AI mode from steering people in the wrong direction for queries involving health and finance.",
      "The need for additional fine tuning is one reason Google is initially only offering AI mode in its experimental Labs section, and only subscribers to its $20-per-month Google One AI Premium will be allowed to test it out at first.",
      "But these tests almost always result in the technology being released to all comers \u2014 a goal that Google is pursuing in response to AI-powered search engines from ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
      "Google's amped-up usage of more sophisticated AI overviews is likely to amplify worries that the summaries will make web surfers even less likely to click on links to take them to sites with useful information on the topic.",
      "Those traffic referrals are one of the main ways that online publishers attract the clicks needed to sell the digital ads that help finance their operations.",
      "Google executives insist AI overviews are still driving traffic to other sites by driving up people's curiosity so they engage in more queries to learn more, resulting in more clicks to other publishers.",
      "But those reassurances haven't placated publishers who believe that Google will be the main beneficiary of AI overviews, further enriching an internet empire that already generates more than $260 billion in annual ad revenue.",
      "The expanded use of AI overviews also could expose Google to more allegations that it is abusing the power of a search engine that a federal judge last year found to be an illegal monopoly in attempt to maintain its position as the internet's main gateway.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department, which filed the monopoly claims against Google in 2020, is now proposing a partial breakup of the company that would include the sale of its Chrome browser as part of its punishment. The hearings on the proposed penalties against Google, which may include digging deeper into its use of AI, are scheduled to begin next month in Washington D.C.",

    "story": [
      "China's leaders are overseeing a spell of deflation, or falling prices, that contrasts with inflationary pressures prevailing elsewhere in the world",
      "BEIJING -- When he bought an apartment near a good high school in northeast Beijing in 2020, Zhou Fujin expected that renting it out would cover most of his mortgage. But the apartment's value and the rent he is getting have plummeted in the past couple years, straining his family\u2019s finances.",
      "China is experiencing a spell of deflation, or falling prices, that contrasts with inflationary pressures prevailing elsewhere in the world. Cheaper prices can be a blessing for some, but deflation is a symptom of relatively weak demand and stalling economic growth.",
      "Such challenges are the backdrop to the annual session of China's parliament, which begins Wednesday. It's unclear what the ruling Communist Party might do to tackle the problem, though some economists expect more government spending. Observers also will be watching for changes to the annual economic growth target, which has hovered near 5% for the past two years.",
      "These are broad, long-term problems. Falling housing prices have left many families reluctant to spend, while factories keep churning out goods.",
      "Economy-wide, prices fell in 2023 and 2024, the longest bout of deflation since the 1960s. The gross domestic product deflator \u2013- the broadest measure of price changes in an economy -\u2013 dipped to -0.8% in the last three months of 2024, compared to -0.5% the quarter before, meaning that deflation has intensified.",
      "Deflation is an abstract economic concept but it reflects very concretely in Zhou\u2019s personal balance sheet, as it does for millions of others. Zhou\u2019s apartment, in Beijing\u2019s Miyun district, cost 2 million yuan ($275,000) when he bought it in 2020, and he financed it with an 800,000 yuan ($110,000) bank loan. The rent he charges has fallen from 2,300 yuan ($316) monthly to 1,700 yuan ($234). His monthly mortgage payment is more than 3,000 yuan ($413), and the apartment is now worth only about 1.4 million yuan ($193,000), he says.",
      "Around the time Zhou bought his apartment, the government began cracking down on excess borrowing by real estate developers, pushing the industry into crisis and many property companies into default. The father of two runs a real estate brokerage firm, which has been hemorrhaging money over the past four years. He has since expanded into home decoration services, helping him to break even.",
      "\u201cGiven that I work in the real estate sector, my income has been greatly affected,\u201d Zhou told The Associated Press. \u201cMy biggest spending is on bank mortgages, my car and my children's education. I've cut other expenditures such as travel. Even my children have realized that money is not easy to earn, and they are willing to spend less.\u201d",
      "Lu Wanyong, who owns a picture framing workshop in Beijing, says he gets only one or two customers a day, down from more than a dozen before the pandemic. Many now prefer to fix broken picture frames rather than buy new ones. Fewer new homeowners come in looking to decorate their apartments.",
      "Lu\u2019s family has burned through its savings and he fears that soon he won\u2019t be able to pay his shop\u2019s 6,000 yuan ($825) rent.",
      "\u201cI am considering shifting to other industries, but the problem is that I am not familiar with any of them. And as a matter of fact, which industry is easy to work in nowadays?\u201d he pondered.",
      "Deflation can be harder for governments to tackle than inflation, experts say, because that requires fixing the underlying issues behind it.",
      "In China\u2019s case, it\u2019s a combination of excess capacity \u2014 manufactured goods produced in such quantities the market cannot absorb them all -\u2013 and the reluctance of consumers to spend and businesses to invest, due to concerns about the sluggish economy. Also, the housing crisis has wiped out an estimated $18 trillion of household wealth, according to a Barclays report, on top of job losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cWhen the real estate market is booming, people believe that they are very rich,\u201d said He-Ling Shi, an associate professor of economics at Australia's Monash University. \u201cIf people believe that they\u2019re rich, they tend to spend their income on consumption. But with the decrease in the price of housing in most parts of China, people believe that they\u2019re no longer as rich as before, so \u2026 they want to increase their savings and reduce their consumption.\u201d",
      "When prices fall, companies' profits also take a hit. That can spur a so-called \u201cdeflationary spiral\u201d of layoffs that further reduce household incomes, leading to even less consumption and potentially to a recession or depression. Fitch Ratings in November warned that deflation is becoming entrenched in China and urged its leaders to adopt policies that can boost demand.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed new 20% tariffs on Chinese exports that are expected to shave up to 1.1 percentage points off China\u2019s GDP growth this year in a \u201csevere scenario\u201d where Chinese exports to the U.S. fall by half, said Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank Investment Banking Group.",
      "Deflation is a ticklish issue for China\u2019s leaders, who began cutting interest rates and required mortgage down-payments last fall. They have launched programs to get local governments to buy unsold apartments to rent out as affordable housing and are encouraging banks to lend more money.",
      "But top leaders tend to focus their public comments on the ruling party's accomplishments and avoid directly mentioning deflation, a thorny problem with no quick fixes.",
      "\u201cThey try to do their best to avoid the word \u2018deflation\u2019 because they believe that will make consumers even more panicked,\u201d Shi said. \u201cIf they become more panicked, they will further reduce their consumption and therefore make the situation worse.\u201d",
      "Some economists, including Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, say the economy can only be rebalanced if consumers gain purchasing power. That requires reducing the share of wealth going into unproductive investments.",
      "The government has sought to encourage more spending by issuing vouchers, while shying away from more fundamental economic reforms.",
      "\u201cEconomic recovery should be linked to a rise in people\u2019s incomes\u201d said Sun Lijian, professor at the School of Economics at Fudan University. \u201cThe government should provide vouchers to help people purchase what they need; this has proven to be an effective way.\u201d",
      "Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist for S&P Global Ratings, says China needs to address long-term, chronic problems including excess industrial production and inefficient state industries. Revamping health care, pensions and education systems would make people \u201cmore comfortable about their financial situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the short term, simply anything that increases household incomes will help on the consumption side,\u201d Kuijs said, \u201cbut probably more importantly is that structural reform element \u2026 and that requires beefing up of the government\u2019s role in health, education and social security.\u201d",

      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil giant Aramco has reported a $106.25 billion profit in 2024, down 12% from the prior year on lower energy prices",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant Aramco reported a $106.25 billion profit in 2024 on Tuesday, down 12% from the prior year as lower energy prices now squeeze the kingdom's multi-trillion-dollar development plans.",
      "Already, Saudi's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been digging a straight-line city in the desert for his $500 billion project at NEOM in Saudi Arabia\u2019s western desert on the Red Sea. He also will need to build tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of the kingdom hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.",
      "Meanwhile, he's also pledged potentially $600 billion in U.S. investments to President Donald Trump to entice him to the kingdom on his first foreign trip as president. Saudi Arabia is also the possible venue for a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's war on Ukraine.",
      "All that and OPEC+ moving toward increasing production means Saudi Arabia likely will need to take on new debt to fund the crown prince's vast ambitions.",
      "A filing on Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange showed Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., had revenues of $436 billion in 2024. That compares to $440.88 billion in 2023.",
      "Aramco reported a $121 billion annual profit in 2023, down from its 2022 record due to lower energy prices as well.",
      "\u201cThe decrease was primarily driven by lower revenue and other income related to sales, higher operating costs, as well as lower finance and other income,\u201d Aramco said in its filing.",
      "Stock in Aramco traded around $7.33 a share Tuesday, down from a high over the last year of $8.71. It has fallen over the past year as oil prices have dropped. Benchmark Brent crude is at $73 \u2014 down 10% this year.",
      "Aramco has a market value of $1.74 trillion, making it the world\u2019s sixth-most valuable company behind Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon and Alphabet, which owns Google.",
      "Aramco will pay dividends of $21.36 billion for the fourth quarter, which includes a far-smaller performance dividend of $220 million. The company expects to pay dividends of $85.4 billion this year, which is far lower and will further erode cash that Saudi Arabia's monarchy can expect for the year.",
      "\u201cOur strong net income and increased base dividend illustrate Aramco\u2019s exceptional resilience,\" Aramco CEO and President Amin H. Nasser said in a statement.",
      "The Aramco results come as OPEC+, an alliance of the oil cartel and other energy-producing states, met online Monday and agreed to proceed with an increase in oil production starting in April. It's the first oil production increase by the group since 2022 and likely will push down oil prices further.",
      "The OPEC+ decision follows criticism by Trump of the cartel as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world\u2019s least expensive places to produce crude. For every $10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil, Saudi Arabia stands to make an additional $40 billion a year, according to the Institute of International Finance.",
      "The Saudi government owns the vast majority of the firm\u2019s shares. Saudi Aramco publicly listed a sliver of its worth back in late 2019 and has weighed offering more shares publicly.",

      "The imposition of new tariffs this week by President Donald Trump against America\u2019s three biggest trading partners drew immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China, sending financial markets into a tailspin. Tariffs threaten to rekindle inflation, which in recent weeks appears to have begun to tick higher and has created more uncertainty for families and businesses.",
      "Trump imposed 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.",

Even before the trade war heated up this week, Target reported falling profits and sales in the crucial period leading up to the year-end holidays, with more customers pausing before breaking out the wallet.",
      "Target CEO Brian Cornell said Tuesday that Americans could see prices for food begin to rise in just a few days, particularly produce from Mexico such as avocados.

      "While Cornell declined to talk specifically about potential price hikes shoppers might see on Target shelves, he warned that there will be price increases for some products.",
      "Target shares are down almost 15% this year and specialty retailers that have seen stock gains are in the minority. Shares of Gap are down 15% this year and shares of American Eagle, Guess and Zumiez are all down about 29%.",
      "Walmart, like Abercrombie & Fitch, thrived in 2024 but sees a potentially rougher path forward.",
      "Late last month, the nation's largest retailer said its per-share earnings for this year could be as much as 27 cents below Wall Street expectations. The company expects annual sales to rise 3% or 4% to between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That also caught Wall Street off guard, where 2025 sales projections had been closer to $708 billion."

      "The Trump administration published a list of more than 440 federal properties it identified to close or sell, including the FBI headquarters and the main Department of Justice building, after deeming them \u201cnot core to government operations.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- The Trump administration on Tuesday published a list of more than 440 federal properties it had identified to close or sell, including the FBI headquarters and the main Department of Justice building, after deeming them \u201cnot core to government operations.\"",
      "Hours later, however, the administration issued a revised list with only 320 entries \u2014 none in Washington, D.C. And by Wednesday morning, the list was gone entirely. \u201cNon-core property list (Coming soon)\u201d the page read.",
      "The General Services Administration, which published the lists, did not immediately respond to questions about the changes or why the properties that had been listed had been removed.",
      "The initial list had included some of the country\u2019s most recognizable buildings, along with courthouses, offices and even parking garage and spanned nearly every state. In Washington, D.C., it included the J. Edgar Hoover Building, which serves as FBI headquarters, the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building, the Old Post Office building, where President Donald Trump once ran a hotel, and the American Red Cross headquarters. The headquarters of numerous agencies, including Department of Labor and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, were listed as well.",
      "Elsewhere in the country, the administration targeted the enormous Major General Emmett J. Bean Federal Center in Indiana, the Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Center, the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Federal Building in San Francisco and the U.S. mission to the United Nations in New York. Roughly 80% of the country's 2.4 million federal workers are based outside of metropolitan Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cWe are identifying buildings and facilities that are not core to government operations, or non-core properties for disposal,\u201d the GSA said of the initial list of 443 properties. Selling the properties \u201censures that taxpayer dollars are no longer spent on vacant or underutilized federal space,\u201d it said, and \u201chelps eliminate costly maintenance and allows us to reinvest in high-quality work environments that support agency missions.\u201d",
      "Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have been engaged in an unprecedented effort to slash the size of the federal workforce and shrink government spending. Selling the designated buildings could save the federal government hundreds of millions of dollars, they claim, while also dramatically reshaping how major Cabinet agencies funded by Congress operate. The Trump administration has also demanded that federal workers report to the office every day.",
      "Several of the buildings on the initial chopping block house agencies that Trump has long criticized and targeted, notably the FBI and Justice Department. The FBI and HUD headquarters are also prime examples of the brutalist architectural style that Trump has tried for years to eliminate, preferring traditional, neo-classical architecture instead.",
      "Eliminating federal office space has been a top priority of the new administration. Last month, GSA regional managers received a message from the agency\u2019s Washington headquarters ordering them to begin terminating leases on all of the roughly 7,500 federal offices nationwide.",
      "In a follow-up meeting, GSA regional managers were told that their goal is to terminate as many as 300 leases per day, according to the employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has listed scores of canceled office leases on DOGE's official website, raising questions around the country about what will happen to services provided from those offices.",
      "Among the properties on the list released Tuesday were a large federal building and courthouse in Los Angeles; a federal building in Oklahoma City that replaced one destroyed in a 1995 bombing; an IRS computing center in West Virginia and IRS service centers in Ogden, Utah; Memphis, Tennessee; Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Andover, Massachusetts; and Holtsville, New York.",
      "The administration also said it was seeking to offload federal buildings bearing the names of civil rights icons Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta and Rosa Parks in Detroit, and the Montgomery, Alabama bus station that was pivotal in the civil rights movement and now serves as the Freedom Rides Museum.",
      "In a statement, the GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service said the bulk of properties it had classified as unnecessary were office spaces.",
      "\u201cDecades of funding deficiencies have resulted in many of these buildings becoming functionally obsolete and unsuitable for use by our federal workforce,\u201d they wrote.",
      "They said GSA would consider the buildings\u2019 futures \u201cin an orderly fashion to ensure taxpayers no longer pay for empty and underutilized federal office space, or the significant maintenance costs associated with long-term building ownership \u2014 potentially saving more than $430 million in annual operating costs.\u201d",
      "The original list of 443 buildings, which are currently owned and maintained by GSA, spanned almost 80 million rentable square feet, the agency said."

      "ROME -- The Prada Group on Tuesday posted double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive year, bucking the luxury sector slide amid talk of a possible Versace acquisition.",
      "The group, which owns the Prada and Miu Miu fashion brands along with Church\u2019s footwear, reported a 17% boost in revenues to 5.4 billion euros ($5.7 billion) last year from 4.7 billion euros in 2023. Retail sales rose 18% to 4.6 billion euros in the period.",
      "The Prada brand, which accounts for the bulk of earnings, reported sales were up a solid 4%, while they nearly doubled at younger Miu Miu. The Prada Group results are against market trends, with the luxury sector as a whole contracting last year for the first time since the Great Recession.",
      "\u201cThis success underscores the enduring relevance of our brands, which comes from an unwavering focus on product innovation, quality, craftmanship and a unique ability to read contemporaneity,\u2019\u2019 said Prada Group Chairman Patrizio Bertelli.",

      "\u201cI think it's on everybody's table,\u2019\u2019 Miuccia Prada said after presenting Prada\u2019s Fall-Winter 2025-26 collection last week.",
      "Asked about Prada's investment plans during an analyst conference call, CEO Andrea Guerra said the company's focus is on growing its current brands, but added it would be \u201carrogant\u201d not to evaluate opportunities that present themselves. He did not mention Versace by name.",
      "Italian media have reported that the sale would value Versace at 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion), a considerable discount on the $2 billion paid by Capri Holding. The current owner has been struggling to reposition the stalwart of Italian fashion, which was founded in 1978 and has been under the creative direction of Donatella Versace for more than 20 years.",

      "But he added there are obstacles to a successful acquisition.",
      "\"Prada has a very bad M&A track record,'' he said. \"Reviving Versace needs a lot of money, competence, management attention, and short-term sacrifice,'' Solca said."

      "LONDON -- The U.S. has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began three years ago. The suspension of that aid by the Trump administration doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine\u2019s defenses will quickly collapse.",
      "But it's a major blow that threatens to remove some of the most formidable weapons in Ukraine\u2019s battlefield arsenal, and ratchets up pressure on Kyiv to accept a peace agreement.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the decision and its implications.",
      "The United States has given the Ukrainians more than $180 billion in assistance since Russia launched an all-out war on Feb. 24, 2022, including more than $66.5 billion in military aid.",
      "Washington provides about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s military supplies, and that fifth includes the most lethal and important equipment, including longer-range missiles and Patriot air defense systems that can shoot down the most powerful Russian projectiles.",
      "American military assistance also goes far beyond weapons and ammunition.",
      "Ukrainian troops rely on satellite communications systems supplied by Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to communicate on the front line, and on American intelligence to track Russian troop movements and select targets for Ukrainian strikes. If the U.S. stops sharing data from satellites and other assets, it would badly affect Ukraine\u2019s capability to strike back at Russia, and Ukraine\u2019s other allies lack the resources to fill the gap.",
      "\u201cA lot will depend on what\u2019s covered by the American suspension,\u201d said Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of defense think-tank RUSI. \u201cWill they suspend all technical assistance to Ukraine? That would have a more dramatic, more rapid impact than simply stopping the pipeline of arms.\u201d",
      "The White House said that the U.S. is \u201cpausing and reviewing\u201d its Ukraine aid to \u201censure that it is contributing to a solution.\u201d The order will remain in effect until Trump determines that Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to peace negotiations with Russia.",
      "The halt came days after an explosive meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance said that Ukraine\u2019s leader hasn't expressed sufficient gratitude for American support.",
      "The U.S. move won\u2019t have an immediate impact on the battlefield, where Kyiv\u2019s forces are struggling to stem a relentless Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have slowed Russian advances along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, where Russia is slowly gaining ground at a huge human and material cost.",
      "The pause in aid will weaken air defenses and will hit Ukraine\u2019s ability to hit Russian targets far behind the front lines.",
      "Alexander Kots, a Russian war blogger, noted that while Ukraine\u2019s European allies can fill some of the gaps and provide artillery systems, they don\u2019t have alternatives to the U.S.-made Patriot and NASAMS air defense missile systems and longer-range HIMARS missile systems that can strike ground targets up to 300 kilometers (200 miles) away.",
      "Kots said that for Ukraine, \u201cthe U.S. aid suspension is unpleasant but not deadly.\u201d",
      "Ukraine has stockpiles of artillery shells and other munitions, and has ramped up domestic production of drones, which are now among the most important weapons in the war. It\u2019s estimated that just over half of the military hardware used by Ukraine is domestically produced.",
      "Chalmers, the RUSI expert, said that the Ukrainians have built up their defense production, and \u201care innovating at an incredible rate because of the pressure they\u2019re under.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they will survive for quite some time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a material blow, and it\u2019s also a challenge to Europe.\u201d",
      "A summit in London on Sunday was aimed at getting European leaders to step up and put Ukraine in the best possible position before potential peace talks.",
      "The U.K. announced that it would use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export financing to supply 5,000 air defense missiles. The European Union has proposed an 800 billion-euro ($841 billion) plan to bolster the defenses of EU nations and provide Ukraine with military muscle.",
      "But Samir Puri, director of the Center for Global Governance and Security at international affairs think tank Chatham House, said that European and American aid are intertwined.",

      "North Carolina legislators appear to be closing in on legislation to provide more funds to help the mountains recover from Hurricane Helene",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina state Senate Republicans advanced a disaster recovery measure Tuesday to direct $533 million in additional spending to meet still-pressing needs from Hurricane Helene\u2019s historic flooding and destruction last fall, but it also locates more relief funding for earlier storms.",
      "The legislation that cleared the Senate's budget-writing committee is wider in scope than a $500 million relief package approved unanimously last week by the House that focused on Helene's destruction in western North Carolina.",
      "Spending provisions within the Senate proposal locates an additional $217 million to complete lingering home construction projects for victims of Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018 in eastern North Carolina. The package also lays the groundwork to assist farmers who suffered agricultural losses last year \u2014 not just from Helene but also from drought and tornadoes.",
      "\u201cWe feel that we need to move with urgency to get this bill across the finish line,\u201d said Sen. Brent Jackson, a Senate Appropriations Committee chairman. \u201cCitizens across all our 100 counties faced disasters in 2024.\u201d",
      "A Senate floor vote on the chamber's bill was expected Wednesday. While House Republicans also are advancing agricultural assistance and Matthew and Florence relief in other measures, top House and Senate leaders later Tuesday said they believed they could agree upon a final supplemental disaster relief bill quickly \u2014 possibly by the end of the week \u2014 then send it to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants the same thing \u2014 to get people help,\u201d said state Rep. John Bell, who has been shepherding the House's $500 million measure.",
      "Last month, Stein offered his own $1.07 billion proposal for additional Helene relief. The amount would double the money already appropriated or made available by the General Assembly for Helene recovery activities since late last year. But GOP legislators seek to spend less now, saying they want to be careful about maximizing federal matching funds and avoiding mistakes after previous storms.",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene, which caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. More than five months later, over 5,700 households in western counties are still receiving temporary housing assistance and more than 200 public roads in the region remain closed or just partially opened, according to state data.",
      "Legislative leaders and Stein agree that more money will be allocated for Helene relief later this year in the state budget because the needs are so great, even with billions arriving from Washington.",
      "\u201cThe underlying message I want to leave with people is we\u2019re making progress but it\u2019s just a start,\u201d Stein said of Helene recovery at the monthly meeting of statewide elected officials earlier Tuesday. \u201cThis work is long term and it\u2019s going to be hard, and we all have to be there together.\u201d",
      "Like the House legislation, the Senate proposal emphasizes repairs for damaged homes, private bridges and roads, assistance to farmers and rebuilding infrastructure adjacent to small businesses. The Senate plan omits a House provision that would allow $15 million to go to nonprofit organizations that could then offer grants to small businesses. Stein and fellow Democrats have pleaded for direct grants to help businesses already weighed down with loans.",
      "The Senate plan does provide money \u2014 although not as much as Stein sought \u2014 for local school districts that closed for many weeks due to Helene to offer summer school instruction. The House plan left out the program.",
      "Republican lawmakers have been angry with delays in the Florence and Matthew housing reconstruction program, which was created by then-Gov. Roy Cooper's administration and funded with federal dollars.",
      "While about 3,300 home construction projects have been completed through the state Office of Recovery and Resiliency, state funds are now needed to complete another 1,000 that remain in various stages of construction. Office leaders blamed the delays on the COVID-19 pandemic, rising construction costs, labor shortages and ultimately management mistakes. The agency's chief operating officer left her job in November.",
      "Both the Senate measure and a separate House bill also approved Tuesday in another committee provides the $217 million, but each bill requires significant monitoring and oversight requirements in how it\u2019s spent. Language in both bills would ultimately shut down the Office of Recovery and Resiliency. Stein\u2019s administration is handling Helene-related home reconstruction through a new agency.",

For instance, automakers are continuing to introduce new EVs and improve their current models. Expanded charging options and very attractive used EV prices are also hot topics for this year. But there are also negative trends you need to watch out for. Edmunds\u2019 auto experts break down what you can expect before heading out and buying an EV for 2025.",
      "According to the NPR article \u201d Here\u2019s how Trump\u2019s tariffs could impact you and your wallet,\u201d the price for certain imported electric vehicles will increase with the Trump administration tariffs. Tariffs on other components or materials used for vehicle manufacturing will also have an impact. Estimates vary widely on how much extra you might have to pay should these tariffs be in effect for a long duration, but it could potentially be thousands of dollars depending on the vehicle.",
      "The new administration has also said it would repeal the federal EV tax credit of $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs. Right now, certain new EVs qualify for a $7,500 tax credit, which can be put toward the sales price with a purchase or lease or toward your tax liability if you purchase it. Used EVs priced under $25,000 can qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000.",
      "Tesla charging stations, which used to be available to Tesla vehicles only, are now open to most non-Tesla EVs. This expansion includes Tesla\u2019s vast network of fast-charging stations called Supercharger stations, and it\u2019s a big deal because it significantly increases the number of charging stations EV owners can use. Public charging stations from various third-party companies like EVgo and Electrify America were the only options for non-Tesla EVs in the past. Tesla\u2019s network of charging stations is nationwide and the largest in the country. The stations are also very reliable and are rarely offline.",
      "Tesla stations can be easy to use once everything is set up. But you need to check with your vehicle\u2019s manufacturer to find out how to use a Tesla charging station and likely buy or obtain a charging connector adaptor.",
      "EV shoppers have plenty of choices in 2025, and most of these models offer plenty of range. Many vehicles, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5, provide over 300 miles of range on certain models. Some high-dollar EVs from Mercedes-Benz and Lucid and electric trucks from GM easily exceeded the 400-mile mark when Edmunds tested them.",
      "EVs are also becoming more affordable; a few have starting prices below $35,000 even without the federal tax credit, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Hyundai Kona Electric. For the lowest monthly payments, consider leasing an EV. Automakers offer great lease deals during certain months thanks to big incentives and the tax credit.",
      "Even with federal tax credits, a new EV is typically more expensive than a comparable gas-powered vehicle. But the resale value of EVs \u2014 essentially, how much they are worth a few years after purchase \u2014 is dropping quicker than those for gas-powered vehicles. That\u2019s great news if you\u2019re in the market for a used EV. For example, 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E GTs that cost more than $60,000 when new are now selling in the low $30,000s.",
      "However, this big drop in value isn\u2019t so great if you\u2019re the one trying to sell or trade in your used EV. You\u2019ll likely be surprised and dismayed that your vehicle is worth substantially less than what you bought it for. It\u2019s especially bad if you owe a significant amount of money on your loan. It\u2019s possible you could owe more on your loan than what the vehicle is actually worth.",
      "If you\u2019re planning on buying an EV this year, it\u2019s best to do it soon in case EV tax credits are repealed and in case prices increase. If you do purchase one, find out how to get access to Tesla charging stations because they are far easier to use than the various third-party stations.",

      "BEIJING -- Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and shoring up the economy are among the issues expected to top the agenda when China\u2019s legislature meets Wednesday in Beijing.",
      "Almost 2,900 delegates have arrived in Beijing for the annual session of the largely rubber-stamp parliament, the National People\u2019s Congress. Concomitantly, an advisory body of business leaders, athletes and academics, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, convened Tuesday. The two bodies\u2019 concurrent meetings are known as the Two Sessions.",
      "The weeklong parliamentary session, though largely ceremonial, helps to signal government priorities for the year. Premier Li Qiang is expected to announce an economic growth target of around 5%, in line with the past couple of years.",
      "The meetings come as China\u2019s economy struggles with sluggish consumption, a lengthy property crisis, ballooning government debt and a possible renewed trade war with the United States. On Tuesday, Beijing announced additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports on U.S. farm products including chicken, pork, soy and beef. The move came in retaliation for an increase in flat U.S. tariffs on Chinese products \u2013 from 10% to 20% \u2013 that came in effect at the same time.",
      "\u201cUndoubtedly, the adverse impacts brought by the external environment have deepened, and China\u2019s economy still faces some difficulties and challenges,\u201d said Lou Qinjian, spokesman for the National People\u2019s Congress in a news conference ahead of the session.",
      "\u201cInternationally, rising economic and political uncertainties make it harder to stabilize external demand. Domestically, demand is insufficient, and some enterprises are experiencing operational difficulties,\u201d he added.",
      "The government is expected to announce some measures to boost consumption such as increasing the deficit ratio from 3% to 4%, though massive stimulus is unlikely.",
      "Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence may also feature in policy announcements.",
      "Lou described China\u2019s breakthrough DeepSeek AI model, unveiled earlier this year, as an example of the country\u2019s \u201cinnovative and inclusive approach to technology.\u201d",
      "The delegates are also set to review a law aimed at improving market conditions for private enterprises, as part of the government\u2019s wider effort to signal support for the public sector to shore up growth.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping met in February with business leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, signaling support at the highest level of leadership.",
      "\u201cXi realizes he needs the private sector to keep his underlying priorities chugging along,\u201d said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cImproving China\u2019s innovation capabilities, improving China\u2019s technological self-reliance - the private sector is pretty good at this stuff, and Xi wants to harness rather than set free the private sector energy to achieve these goals.\u201d",
      "Beijing is also expected to unveil its defense budget for 2025. Last year, China announced a 7.2% increase in its defense budget, which is the world\u2019s second-highest behind the United States\u2019.",

      "BEIJING -- China responded to new U.S. tariffs by announcing Tuesday it will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and expanded controls on doing business with key U.S. companies.",
      "The tariffs announced by the Commerce Ministry will take effect from March 10, though goods already in transit will be exempt until April 12. They follow U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s order to raise tariffs on imports of Chinese products to 20% across the board. Those took effect on Tuesday, along with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.",
      "China\u2019s is a major importer of American farm products. Purchases dipped after Trump launched a trade war during his first term and then recovered.",
      "Now, imports of U.S.-grown chicken, wheat, corn and cotton will face an extra 15% tariff, the Chinese ministry said. Tariffs on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruit, vegetables and dairy products will be increased by 10%.",
      "The U.S. tariffs began a day before the annual session of China\u2019s parliament, which begins Wednesday and will focus in part on deflation and other issues affecting the world's second largest economy.",
      "By raising tariffs, the U.S. has repaid kindness with enmity, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, adding, \u201cI would like to reiterate that the Chinese people have never been afraid of evil, do not believe in ghosts, and have never been bullied.\u201d",
      "While the tariffs on American farm products are sweeping, China held back from imposing higher ones across the board, and \u201cboth sides showed restraint,\u201d said Sun Chenghao, an international relations professor at Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. hopes to get a trade deal with China in the end,\u201d Sun said. \u201cFor the long term, it is possible that China and the U.S. will continue to negotiate, but the current atmosphere is not good.\u201d",
      "Separately, China's customs said it was suspending the import of U.S. lumber effective immediately, saying it had detected \u201cforest pests such as bark beetles and longhorn beetles\" in imported logs. China also suspended the soybean import qualifications of three U.S. companies after saying it detected ergot \u2014 a kind of fungi \u2014 as well as seed-coating agents in soybeans exported to China.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also launched its first anti-circumvention investigation into the import of fiber optic products from the U.S., which it said was initiated at the request of a domestic fiber optic company. The evidence submitted showed that U.S. exporters \u201cmay have circumvented China\u2019s anti-dumping measures\" on certain products, the ministry said.",
      "Also Tuesday, Beijing placed 10 more U.S. firms on its unreliable entity list, which would bar them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and making new investments in the country. Some already likely face restrictions on trade with China if their products can be used for both military and civilian purposes.",
      "The firms listed are TCOM, Limited Partnership; Stick Rudder Enterprises LLC; Teledyne Brown Engineering; Huntington Ingalls Industries; S3 AeroDefense; Cubic Corporation; TextOre; ACT1 Federal; Exovera and Planate Management Group.",
      "Separately, China added 15 U.S. companies to its export control list, including aerospace and defense companies like General Dynamics Land Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, among others, asserting that they \u201cendanger China\u2019s national security and interests.\u201d",
      "In 2024, China imported $24.7 billion in farm products from the U.S., or 14% of its $176 billion in total farm exports. Mexico was the largest importer of U.S. farm goods, followed by Canada.",
      "In 2021-22, the United States logged record export values to China for soybeans, corn, beef, chicken meat, tree nuts, and sorghum. Cotton exports to China also rebounded, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "But China has been diversifying its sources for farm imports, buying more soybeans from Brazil and Argentina, among others.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry included about two dozen U.S. farm exports subject to additional 15% tariffs, including chicken feet and wings, and 711 items subject to an extra 10% tariff.",
      "Beijing is prepared to hit back, said Xu Botao, research director of the GoGlobal Institute at EqualOcean, a Shanghai-based Chinese think tank \u201cThe Chinese government and Chinese companies will not be easily frightened,\u201d Xu said.",

    "story": [
      "Alex Ovechkin is already the career leader in power-play goals in the NHL",
      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Wayne Gretzky was so able to control hockey games from behind the net that the area became known as \u201cGretzky's office,\u201d as he put up more assists than anyone else in NHL history has points.",
      "Alex Ovechkin has scored so many goals with his patented one-timer from the left faceoff circle on the power play that it became known as his spot. Retired goaltender Eddie Lack referred to it as the \u201cOvizoid.\"",
      "Just like with Gretzky, whose record of 894 goals he is closing in on breaking, Ovechkin's brilliance comes not from one shot but rather the variety with which he has scored over his two-decade-long career. He has the most career power-play goals and the most empty-netters and soon will pass Gretzky for tops on the overall list thanks to an evolution of his game that has seen him score from more places on the ice in his 20th season than previous years.",
      "\"Everyone talks about his spot, but he scores goals from everywhere,\u201d said St. Louis coach Jim Montgomery, who played against Gretzky in North America and then briefly faced a young Ovechkin in Russia. \u201cThe true test to his intelligence and creativity is the fact that he\u2019s done it for so many years as the league has continued to change.\u201d",
      "According to NHL Edge puck and player tracking data, Ovechkin has put a shot on net from 15 of the 16 quadrants in the offensive zone and scored from 11 of them.",
      "That is a testament to Ovechkin, now 39 and scoring at a rate almost never seen at this age, adjusting to how opponents defend him and fooling goaltenders in different ways. He has scored on a league-record 181 goalies, adding six new ones to that list this season.",
      "\u201cHe shoots hard, he can shoot through you, so it makes it more difficult, especially when it\u2019s coming from a bunch of different angles,\u201d said Logan Thompson, in his first season as a teammate of Ovechkin's with the Washington Capitals after being the 160th netminder he beat along the way. \u201cHe\u2019s always finding a way to get it through and he makes it really tricky on goalies. There\u2019s really no method on how to stop him.\u201d",
      "For the defenders tasked with trying to contain Ovechkin, the approach changes with the situation. From his spot, everyone knows what is coming because he has scored 320 times on the power play \u2014 46 more than the next closest.",
      "At even strength, where Ovechkin has scored 495 of his 884 goals and counting, the challenge is keeping an eye on him knowing he has what Blues goalie Jordan Binnington called an \u201con-off release\u201d and can fling the puck at the net unexpectedly at times.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not really sure where he shoots it from, and it just finds a way to go in the net,\u201d said Ottawa defenseman Nick Jensen, who played parts of six seasons with Ovechkin on the Capitals. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing it for so long that I can\u2019t really explain it. It\u2019s kind of a phenomenon a little bit \u2014 or an anomaly. But he\u2019s been doing it for so long, and he continues to do this year.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin reached the 30-goal mark again this season, the record 19th time he has done that, one of the biggest reasons the Capitals are among the top teams in the league. He has thrived alongside 20-something linemates Dylan Strome and Aliaksei Protas, who have embraced the role of getting Ovechkin the puck as much as reasonably possible.",
      "\"He can pretty much get his shot off anywhere,\" said Strome, who assisted on 17 of Ovechkin's first 31 goals. \u201cHe\u2019s been scoring in front of the net or even some wrist shots from the other side. I think the more shot volume the better. It\u2019s good when you come out of a game and see like 12 or 13 shot attempts and seven or eight on net. Usually good things happen when there\u2019s that many chances.\"",
      "Ovechkin has put more shots on net than any player in league history, and the only reason he's not again in the top 10 this season is that he missed 16 games with a broken left leg. Quality over quantity, perhaps, as he is scoring at a career-best shooting rate of 18.1 percent.",
      "According to NHL statistics, Ovechkin has gotten seven different types of shots on net: 62 snap, 50 wrist, 36 slap, 10 backhand, 10 tips, two deflections and one between the legs. Fourteen goals have come on snap shots, eight on wrist shots, five on slap shots, three on backhanders and one on a tip.",
      "\u201cAny time there\u2019s unpredictability, it makes it hard,\u201d said retired defenseman Karl Alzner, who played nine seasons with Ovechkin and three more against him with Montreal.",
      "\u201cAs long as he continues to be unpredictable and do things a little bit different than we\u2019ve seen from his whatever it is 18 years of resume, it\u2019s going to be hard for teams to shut him down.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin is tied for the league lead with seven empty-netters and has the most all time with 64. Gretzky scored 56 of them, too, and coach Spencer Carbery is quick to point out that it's not as easy as it looks.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of skilled players that play around the league 5 on 6 that aren\u2019t your quote-unquote defensive specialists or your penalty-kill guys that have a ton of value playing 5 on 6 because they are so intelligent with what the offensive players want to do,\u201d Carbery said. \"They know where the next play is and where the puck\u2019s going, and that\u2019s what you see from \u2018O\u2019 constantly is he\u2019s reading where the next puck is going.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin is on pace to break Gretzky's record sometime in April before the end of this regular season, and No. 895 could come from any number of different ways. Even his teammates don't know what to expect.",
      "\"One-timer would be a nice thing to see, but obviously any goal would be,\" Protas said. \u201cAny way, no matter how, it\u2019s going to be a special moment.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- The trial of seven people charged in connection with alleged cyberbullying targeting the artistic director of last summer\u2019s Paris Olympics\u2019 opening and closing ceremonies has started in a Paris court.",
      "Thomas Jolly filed a complaint for death threats after receiving homophobic and antisemitic abuse on social networks. The online attacks erupted after Jolly\u2019s acclaimed but controversial opening spectacle on the Seine in July \u2014 a queer-inclusive, high-energy fusion of tradition and modernity.",
      "Local media reported that Jolly did not attend Wednesday\u2019s hearing, with two of the people charged also not attending because they were either sick or could not make themselves available.",
      "The abuse last summer quickly escalated, including attacks based on Jolly's sexual orientation and wrongly assumed Israeli roots, and reportedly aimed to silence the artistic intent of the show. Jolly responded by filing a formal complaint with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office on July 31, prompting an investigation that led to arrests in the south of France in October 2024.",
      "The seven people charged, ranging in age from 22 to 79, face counts of death threats, aggravated insults, and cyberbullying \u2014 serious allegations carrying the weight of potential prison time and heavy fines.",
      "A verdict in the Jolly\u2019s case is expected at a later date.",
      "The arrests were seen as a first step in France\u2019s fight against cyberbullying, which authorities noted has become increasingly sophisticated. In Jolly\u2019s case, prosecutors pointed to the disturbing \u201cpack behavior\u201d of attackers acting independently to escalate the harassment, a pattern seen in other online hate campaigns.",
      "Jolly\u2019s complaint came after the opening ceremony prompted a storm of outrage in the wake of a contentious scene featuring drag queens and other performers. Although Jolly has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t inspired by \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d vocal criticism of the show from some quarters interpreted it as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s painting depicting Jesus Christ and his apostles.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron extended full support to Jolly and all performing artists who were part of the Olympics opening show. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also expressed \u201cunwavering support\u201d of Jolly in the face of the threats and harassment.",

      "Auburn has held the top spot in the poll for eight straight weeks and was a unanimous No. 1 pick for a second consecutive week.",
      "Pearl denied that Auburn looked past the Aggies after wrapping up the conference championship this weekend. He said their struggles were simply a matter of A&M playing better Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cThey physically manhandled us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if this team is going to continue to win, we\u2019re going to run up against teams like Texas A&M or like Florida or like Duke that are big and physical.\u201d",
      "The Aggies entered the game leading the nation in offensive rebounding and Pearl pointed to their 24-9 advantage in this game as evidence of their physicality.",

      "\u201cWe have to play incredibly physical, and I think we have to do a lot of the things that are not necessarily in the stat sheet for for us to win,\u201d Williams said.",
      "The Tigers were also hurt by an off night from top scorer Johni Broome, who entered the game averaging 18.4 points but managed just eight. He left the game for a couple of minutes early in the first half with what appeared to be a shoulder injury but played 32 minutes despite the problem.",
      "\u201cIt may have affected him,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cHe obviously had a shoulder injury in December. He had it banged a few times and it he obviously had it banged (Tuesday) and it was bothering him. He tried to play through it.\u201d",
      "Along with Broome\u2019s struggles Tuesday, the Tigers were also without one of their top defenders in Denver Jones, who sat out with an ankle injury.",
      "\u201cDenver\u2019s the best one-on-one cover guy I got,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cSo obviously missing Denver was a factor.\u201d"

      "Edmonton sent a 2025 second- and a 2026 fourth-round pick and prospect Max Wanner to Boston for the 6-foot-3, 220-pounder, with the Bruins retaining half of Frederic's $2.3 million salary.

In addition to adding Frederic at a bargain cap hit of $575,000 \u2014 under the league minimum \u2014 the Oilers also got depth forward Max Jones in this deal.",

      "The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the agreement hasn't been announced. FanSided first reported that Quintana was signing with the Brewers.",
      "Quintana, 36, is coming off a 2024 season in which he went 10-10 with a 3.75 ERA in 31 starts for the New York Mets. He struck out 135 and walked 63 in 170 1/3 innings. Over his last six regular-season starts, Quintana gave up four runs \u2014 three earned \u2014 in 36 1/3 innings.",
      "He started the deciding game of New York\u2019s NL Wild Card Series matchup with the Brewers and pitched six shutout innings in the Mets\u2019 4-2 victory, though he received no decision. Quintana had a total of three postseason starts, allowing six runs \u2014 five earned \u2014 over 14 1/3 innings.",
      "Quintana now will compete for a spot in a Brewers rotation that returns right-handers Freddy Peralta, Tobias Myers and Aaron Civale. The two-time defending NL Central champions also added left-hander Nestor Cortes in a trade that sent two-time NL reliever of the year Devin Williams to the New York Yankees.",
      "The Brewers could use some rotation depth as two-time All-Star Brandon Woodruff and Robert Gasser come back from injuries. Woodruff missed all of 2024 while recovering from shoulder surgery, and he won\u2019t be ready for the start of the season. Gasser, who is recovering from Tommy John surgery, isn\u2019t expected to be available until late in the season.",
      "Milwaukee got more bad news Monday night when left-hander Aaron Ashby, a candidate for a rotation spot, left his start against the Cincinnati Reds with an injury. Murphy told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Ashby appeared to have an oblique issue and would undergo an MRI.",

    "story": [
      "NASCAR has filed a counterclaim against Michael Jordan-owned 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports alleging they \u201cwillfully\u201d violated antitrust laws in connection with the most recent charter agreements",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NASCAR's revenue-sharing charter system is under threat of being disbanded according to a Wednesday counterclaim filed by the stock car series against Michael Jordan-owned 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports that singles out Jordan's longtime business manager.",
      "The contentiousness began after more than two years of negotiations on new charter agreements \u2014 NASCAR's equivalent of a franchise model \u2014 and the 30-page filing contends that Jordan business manager Curtis Polk \u201cwillfully\u201d violated antitrust laws by orchestrating anticompetitive collective conduct in connection with the most recent charter agreements.",
      "23XI and Front Row were the only two organizations out of 15 that refused to sign the new agreements, which were presented to the teams last September in a take-it-or-leave-it offer a mere 48 hours before the start of NASCAR's playoffs.",
      "The charters were fought for by the teams ahead of the 2016 season and twice have been extended. The latest extension is for seven years to match the current media rights deal and guarantee 36 of the 40 spots in each week's field to the teams that hold them, as well as other financial incentives. 23XI and Front Row refused to sign and sued, alleging NASCAR and the France family that owns the stock car series are a monopoly.",
      "NASCAR already has lost one round in court in which the two teams have been recognized as chartered organizations for the 2025 season as the legal dispute winds through the courts.",
      "In the new counterclaim, Polk is repeatedly singled out as the ringleader against the current charter proposals. NASCAR attorney Christopher Yates went so far as to tell The Associated Press that Polk, who in addition to being Jordan's business manager is a co-owner of 23XI along with three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, does not understand the NASCAR business model.",
      "\u201cCurtis Polk basically orchestrated and threatened a boycott of one of the qualifying races for a major event and others did not go along with him,\u201d Yates said. \u201cHe got other teams to boycott a meeting that was required by the charter. When you have a threatened boycott of qualifying races that are covered by media that's not a good thing for other race teams, not a good thing when you are trying to collectively grow the sport.\"",
      "The qualifying race in question was the 2024 pair of 150-mile duels that set the field for the Daytona 500.",
      "\u201cI don't think Mr. Polk really understands the sport,\u201d Yates told the AP. \u201cI think he came into it and his view is it should be much more like the NBA or other league sports. But it's not. No motorsport is like that. He's done a lot of things that might work in the NBA or might be OK in the NBA but just are not appropriate in NASCAR.\u201d",
      "NASCAR's complaint alleges \u201cthe undisputed reality is that it is 23XI and FRM, led by 23XI\u2019s owner and sports agent Curtis Polk, that willfully violated the antitrust laws by orchestrating anticompetitive collective conduct in connection with the terms of the 2025 Charter Agreements.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is truly ironic that in trying to blow-up the Charter system, 23XI and FRM have sought to weaponize the antitrust laws to achieve their goals,\" the counterclaim says, alleging Polk's threats are \u201cattempting to misuse the legal system as a last resort to secure new terms.\u201d",
      "Bob Jenkins, an entrepreneur, owns Front Row Motorsports and joined 23XI in the lawsuit when he declined to sign the 2025 charter agreement last September.",
      "NASCAR's counterclaim asks for an injunction eliminating guaranteed starting spots for charter teams. NASCAR wants the four combined charters held by 23XI and Front Row before the lawsuit to be returned to NASCAR, and it wants to dissolve the two charters each team purchased ahead of the 2025 season for their own individual expansion.",
      "\u201cThere's a misperception out there that somehow 23IX and Front Row might achieve something that other teams can take advantage of, and that's just not right,\u201d Yates told the AP. \"This is not going to be a renegotiation. NASCAR has no intent of renegotiating the terms of the charter. Front Row and 23XI are threatening the charter system and its continuation, and NASCAR is fine without the charter system.",
      "\u201cThe charter system was created at the request of the teams. That was before 23XI and Curtis Polk's time, I don't think they understand that history. But if they succeed with their lawsuit and the charter system goes away, that's OK.\u201d",
      "Yates told the AP he's asked Jeffrey Kessler, the attorney representing 23XI and Front Row, what is it the two teams want and cannot get a straight answer.",
      "\u201cThe mere fact that the lawsuit calls the system into question, I really think 23XI and Front Row are being pretty selfish in terms of what they are trying to do, and I don't think they are taking into account the 32 teams that have signed the charters and think it is a good deal for them,\" Yates said. \u201cDo some of them think they should have gotten more? I'm sure. Does NASCAR think it should have gotten more? Absolutely. But NASCAR does not see the charter system as necessary.\u201d",
      "Jordan has said he's suing NASCAR on behalf of all the teams so that even the smallest ones can receive equal footing in terms of benefits as a participant in the top motorsports league in the United States.",
      "Among the improvements in the 2025 charters is a more equitable revenue share, but missing is the demand that teams wanted the charters to become permanent. NASCAR at its discretion can claw back charters from underperforming teams or eliminate the system completely. Yates said NASCAR has no intention of renegotiating the charters signed in September by 13 organizations, nor did he see a scenario in which NASCAR settles the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cPolk and 23XI\u2019s other owners openly professed that they wanted to change NASCAR\u2019s economic model by demanding more money for the teams from NASCAR media revenues, instead of teams competing against each other,\" Yates said. \u201cHowever, 23XI and FRM did not merely reject the terms of the 2025 Charters. Rather, those teams embarked on a strategy to threaten, coerce, and extort NASCAR into meeting their demands for better contract and financial terms.\u201d",

      "The Atlantic Coast Conference, Clemson and Florida State have approved a settlement that would end their legal fights",
      "The Atlantic Coast Conference, Clemson and Florida State have approved a settlement that would end their legal fights, change the league's revenue-distribution model and revise the long-term costs for a school to leave the conference.",
      "Trustees at Clemson and FSU both signed off on the deal in Tuesday meetings. That came shortly after the ACC's Board of Directors \u2014 made up of university presidents and chancellors \u2014 gave its OK, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the league and schools had not publicly addressed the settlement at the time.",
      "Most notably, the revenue-distribution model will now incorporate TV viewership as a way for the league's top programs to generate more revenue. It also provides a clarity on the league's exit fee and grant-of-rights agreement that runs through the ACC's TV deal with ESPN through 2036.",
      "Specifically, a slideshow during a presentation to Clemson's trustees reported the exit fee would be $165 million for the 2026 fiscal year, but would descend by $18 million per year until leveling off around $75 million for the 2030-31 season. While a grant-of-rights agreement gives the league control of a school's media rights, the deal would allow a school to exit with its media rights after paying the exit fee, according to that presentation.",
      "The agreement offers a measure of stability for the league in the coming years, though with the longer-term risk of teams potentially deciding to leave in the final years of the current media deal in a time of rapid changes to the college landscape.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, this innovative distribution model which further incentivizes performance and investment will help strengthen the ACC,\" Clemson athletic director Graham Neff told trustees before the vote. \u201cA strong ACC is good for Clemson. And a strong Clemson is good for the ACC.\u201d",
      "The exit costs had been a key subject of FSU\u2019s December 2023 lawsuit, filed as it sought to explore potential membership in other leagues, and Clemson\u2019s March 2024 lawsuit. The ACC had conversely sued both schools.",
      "\u201cI got hundreds of emails and text messages and phone calls from friends and people I didn\u2019t know over the last 13 months encouraging us in this journey and I\u2019m proud of where we\u2019ve landed,\u201d FSU trustee and former Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford said during that meeting.",

Deferred salaries and bonus payments are discounted to present-day values, and termination pay, option buyouts and cash transactions among clubs are accounted for.",

      "Britain\u2019s competition watchdog says it has dropped its review of Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI",
      "LONDON -- Britain's competition watchdog said Wednesday it has dropped its review of Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, saying it's satisfied that the deal doesn't need a closer investigation under the country's merger rules.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said that based on \u201cavailable evidence,\" the partnership between the U.S. tech giant and the ChatGPT maker doesn't qualify for a merger investigation.",
      "\u201cIn particular the CMA does not consider there has been a change of control by Microsoft from material influence to de facto control over OpenAI,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement.",
      "Microsoft was a big initial backer of OpenAI, plowing billions of dollars into the San Francisco-based startup in its early days. But since then OpenAI has attracted other big investors including Japan's Softbank and chipmaker Nvidia after its success with ChatGPT.",
      "The CMA has stepped up scrutiny of AI deals amid a wave of investment from Big Tech companies into startups working on generative artificial intelligence. Last year it approved another Microsoft deal involving Inflection AI as well as partnerships with chatbot maker Anthropic by Google and Amazon."

      "Teaching machines in the way that animal trainers mold the behavior of dogs or horses has been an important method for developing artificial intelligence and one that was recognized Wednesday with the top computer science award.",
      "Two pioneers in the field of reinforcement learning, Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton, are the winners of this year's A.M. Turing Award, the tech world's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.",
      "Research that Barto, 76, and Sutton, 67, began in the late 1970s paved the way for some of the past decade's AI breakthroughs. At the heart of their work was channeling so-called \u201chedonistic\u201d machines that could continuously adapt their behavior in response to positive signals.",
      "Reinforcement learning is what led a Google computer program to beat the world's best human players of the ancient Chinese board game Go in 2016 and 2017. It's also been a key technique in improving popular AI tools like ChatGPT, optimizing financial trading and helping a robotic hand solve a Rubik's Cube.",
      "But Barto said the field was \"not fashionable\u201d when he and his doctoral student, Sutton, began crafting their theories and algorithms at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",
      "\u201cWe were kind of in the wilderness,\u201d Barto said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s so gratifying to receive this award, to see this becoming more recognized as something relevant and interesting. In the early days, it was not.\u201d",
      "Google sponsors the annual $1 million prize, which was announced Wednesday by the Association for Computing Machinery.",
      "Barto, now retired from the University of Massachusetts, and Sutton, a longtime professor at Canada's University of Alberta, aren't the first AI pioneers to win the award named after British mathematician, codebreaker and early AI thinker Alan Turing. But their research has directly sought to answer Turing's 1947 call for a machine that \u201ccan learn from experience\u201d \u2014 which Sutton describes as \u201carguably the essential idea of reinforcement learning.\u201d",
      "In particular, they borrowed from ideas in psychology and neuroscience about the way that pleasure-seeking neurons respond to rewards or punishment. In one landmark paper published in the early 1980s, Barto and Sutton set their new approach on a specific task in a simulated world: balance a pole on a moving cart to keep it from falling. The two computer scientists later co-authored a widely used textbook on reinforcement learning.",
      "\u201cThe tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments,\u201d said Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean in a written statement.",
      "In a joint interview with the AP, Barto and Sutton didn't always agree on how to evaluate the risks of AI agents that are constantly seeking to improve themselves. They also distinguished their work from the branch of generative AI technology that is currently in fashion \u2014 the large language models behind chatbots made by OpenAI, Google and other tech giants that mimic human writing and other media.",
      "\u201cThe big choice is, do you try to learn from people\u2019s data, or do you try to learn from an (AI) agent\u2019s own life and its own experience?\u201d Sutton said.",
      "Sutton has dismissed what he describes as overblown concerns about AI's threat to humanity, while Barto disagreed and said \u201cYou have to be cognizant of potential unexpected consequences.\u201d",
      "Barto, retired for 14 years, describes himself as a Luddite, while Sutton is embracing a future he expects to have beings of greater intelligence than current humans \u2014 an idea sometimes known as posthumanism.",
      "\u201cPeople are machines. They\u2019re amazing, wonderful machines,\u201d but they are also not the \u201cend product\u201d and could work better, Sutton said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intrinsically a part of the AI enterprise,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand ourselves and, of course, to make things that can work even better. Maybe to become such things.\u201d",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- A federal judge has denied Elon Musk's request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company but said she could expedite a trial to consider Musk's claims against the ChatGPT maker and its CEO.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled late Tuesday that \u201cMusk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits\u201d in his request for a preliminary injunction. She offered to hold a trial in her California courtroom as soon as this fall, \u201cgiven the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker and CEO Sam Altman a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was unfairly stifling business competition.",
      "He and a group of investors more recently made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy a controlling stake in the nonprofit \u2014 a move that undermined Musk\u2019s \u201cclaim of irreparable harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "OpenAI said it welcomed the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThis has always been about competition,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cElon\u2019s own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Musk alleges in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. He had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement late Tuesday that he is pleased that the court offered an expedited trial on the core claims.",
      "\"We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk\u2019s charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public\u2019s benefit rather than his own enrichment,\u201d Toberoff said.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers in a hearing last month called it a \u201cstretch\u201d to claim \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Musk, and she called the case \u201cbillionaires vs. billionaires.\u201d She questioned why Musk invested tens of millions in OpenAI without a written contract. Toberoff responded that it was because the relationship between Altman and Musk at the time was \u201cbuilt on trust\u201d and the two were very close.",
      "\u201cThat is just a lot of money\u201d to invest \u201con a handshake,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The dispute has roots in a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers, appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2011, has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple\u2019s fight with Epic Games, though she said last month that Musk\u2019s case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago.",
      "A newly discovered cache of 27 carved and sharpened bones from elephants and hippos found in Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge site pushes back the date for ancient bone tool use by around 1 million years. Researchers know that early people made simple tools from stones as early as 3.3 million years ago.",
      "The new discovery, published Wednesday in Nature, reveals that ancient humans \u201chad rather more complex tool kits than previously we thought,\u201d incorporating a variety of materials, said William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.",
      "The well-preserved bone tools, measuring up to around 16 inches (40 centimeters), were likely made by breaking off the thick ends of leg bones and using a stone to knock off flakes from the remaining bone shaft. This technique was used to create one sharpened edge and one pointed tip, said study co-author Ignacio de la Torre, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "The bone tools were \u201cprobably used as a hand axe\u201d \u2013 a handheld blade that\u2019s not mounted on a stick \u2013 for butchering dead animals, he said.",
      "Such a blade would be handy for removing meat from elephant and hippo carcasses, but not used as a spear or projectile point. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they were hunting these animals. They were probably scavenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of the artifacts show signs of having been struck to remove flakes more than a dozen times, revealing persistent craftsmanship.",
      "The uniform selection of the bones \u2013 large and heavy leg bones from specific animals \u2013 and the consistent pattern of alteration makes it clear that early humans deliberately chose and carved these bones, said M\u00edrian Pacheco, a paleobiologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The bone show minimal signs of erosion, trampling or gnawing by other animals \u2014 ruling out the possibility that natural causes resulted in the tool shapes, she added.",
      "The bone tools date from more than a million years before our species, Homo sapiens, arose around 300,000 years ago.",
      "At the time the tools were made, three different species of human ancestors lived in the same region of East Africa, said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program, who was not involved in the study.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts \u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \u201cengineer them into living animals,\u201d said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you\u2019re not bringing back the ancient past,\u201d said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \u201cColossal woolly mouse.\u201d",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\u201d said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \u201cmake it a lot more efficient and easier,\u201d said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \u201cpresent already in some living mice,\u201d said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \u201cwe put them all together in a single mouse.\u201d",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \u201ca lot of processes and red tape\u201d before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \u201cde-extinction.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it\u2019s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It\u2019s changing an Asian elephant,\u201d said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal\u2019s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",

      "But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musk's recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASA's projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab.",
      "\u201cThis place is ticking. It's just really amazing, so I would say we're actually in our prime right now,\u201d said Williams, a three-time space station resident. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits.\u201d",

      "Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.",
      "Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.",
      "Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASA\u2019s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency\u2019s Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Wilmore and Williams \u2014 retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers \u2014 have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.",
      "They will wear generic SpaceX flight suits for the ride back, not the usual custom-made outfits bearing their names because their trip home in a Dragon capsule was unplanned. That's fine with them, although Wilmore hinted he might use a pen to write his name on his suit.",

      "DECATUR, Ga. -- Outside Beacon Hill Middle School in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, like along hundreds of roadsides across Georgia, the unblinking eye of a camera tickets drivers who speed through a school zone.",
      "Supporters say cameras slow down drivers and provide constant enforcement that understaffed police departments can't equal. But some state lawmakers want to ban them, saying the cameras are more about generating money for local governments and camera companies, and that some use them deceptively.",
      "More than 20 states and the District of Columbia allow automated traffic cameras to issue speeding tickets, but more than 10 other states have outlawed them. However, it would be unusual for a state to reverse its position. New Jersey had a pilot program testing cameras to enforce red lights, but pulled the plug in 2014.",
      "Georgia's fight will come to a head soon in its General Assembly, with three separate bills advancing out of committees. The state first authorized speed cameras, but only in school zones, in 2018.",
      "More than 100 representatives in Georgia's 180-member House signed on to House Bill 225, which would ban the cameras. Dale Washburn, the Macon Republican sponsoring that measure, provided a stack of emails from outraged people ticketed statewide who said lights weren't flashing, they didn't even know they were in a school zone, or the cameras were otherwise unfair.",
      "While the tickets in Georgia are civil citations and don't go on a driver\u2019s criminal record, the state does block people who don\u2019t pay from renewing their vehicle registration. Almost 125,000 unpaid violations were reported in 2024, the Georgia Department of Revenue said. The cameras generated more than $112 million in revenue in 54 Georgia cities and counties since 2019, WANF-TV found last year. Camera companies typically take a share of the revenue.",
      "\u201cThese camera companies are engaged in deceit and trickery,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cTheir goal is to write tickets, not to enhance children\u2019s safety.\"",
      "One issue with abolishing cameras is that companies have become big political donors. Two big vendors, United Kingdom-based RedSpeed and Tennessee-based Blue Line Solutions, contributed around $500,000 to Georgia campaigns in recent years, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics.",
      "Legislative leaders seem more likely to support two other bills that would keep cameras, but more closely regulate them by providing better warning signs and limiting the hours of usage.",
      "\u201cSo the objective is to alert drivers that they're entering a school zone and get them to slow down and then for them not to be cited unless they are speeding in a school zone during designated hours,\u201d said Republican Sen. Max Burns of Sylvania, who is sponsoring Senate Bill 75.",
      "An alternate House bill that is similar to Burns' would require half the money raised go to school safety.",
      "In Decatur, students surge out of Beacon Hill Middle at dismissal and walk along College Avenue, a two-lane street that's also a state highway. Unlike most places in Georgia, where most students travel home in buses or their parents' cars, a majority of Decatur's 5,300 students either walk or ride bikes home.",
      "Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said a student at Beacon Hill was struck in a hit-and-run accident and a crossing guard elsewhere was also hit before Decatur activated its cameras last fall.",
      "\u201cWe really want to protect our most vulnerable residents, our students, and particularly when they are on foot or on a bicycle,\" Garrett said.",
      "Police Chief Scott Richards said according to a speed study conducted by the company, speeding has fallen 92%. But there are still plenty of drivers flying through the five zones where Decatur is using cameras. They issued 4,500 valid citations in January alone, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to get those reductions if it were not for the photo enforcement in school zones,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Decatur officials tout their efforts as a model, saying the city has abundant signage and only operates the cameras for a 30 minutes before and after schools begin in the morning and dismiss in the afternoon. A vehicle must be traveling 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) per hour over the speed limit to be cited.",
      "Still, Washburn and others say the amount of money involved encourages overuse and bad behavior.",
      "\u201cProfit-based law enforcement cannot be trusted,\u201d John Moore of Milledgeville wrote to Washburn in February. \u201cI hope you can convince your colleagues to vote this menace out of our state for good.\u201d"

      "Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Molly Kelly was stunned to discover in June that someone she knew had used widely available \u201cnudification\u201d technology to create highly realistic and sexually explicit videos and images of her, using family photos that were posted on social media.",
      "\u201cMy initial shock turned to horror when I learned that the same person targeted about 80, 85 other women, most of whom live in Minnesota, some of whom I know personally, and all of them had connections in some way to the offender,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Backed by her testimony, Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography. A bill that has bipartisan support would target companies that run websites and apps allowing people to upload a photo that then would be transformed into explicit images or videos.",
      "States across the country and Congress are considering strategies for regulating artificial intelligence. Most have banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn whether they were produced with AI or not. The idea behind the Minnesota legislation is to prevent the material from ever being created \u2014 before it spreads online.",
      "Experts on AI law caution the proposal might be unconstitutional on free speech grounds.",
      "The lead author, Democratic Sen. Erin Maye Quade, said additional restrictions are necessary because AI technology has advanced so rapidly. Her bill would require the operators of \u201cnudification\u201d sites and apps to turn them off to people in Minnesota or face civil penalties up to $500,000 \u201cfor each unlawful access, download, or use.\u201d Developers would need to figure out how to exclude Minnesota users.",
      "It\u2019s not just the dissemination that\u2019s harmful to victims, she said. It\u2019s the fact that these images exist at all.",
      "Kelly told reporters last month that anyone can quickly create \u201chyper-realistic nude images or pornographic video\u201d in minutes.",
      "Most law enforcement attention so far has been focused on distribution and possession.",
      "San Francisco in August filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against several widely visited \u201cnudification\u201d websites, alleging they broke state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. That case remains pending.",
      "The U.S. Senate last month unanimously approved a bill by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, to make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. Social media platforms would be required to remove them within 48 hours of notice from a victim. Melania Trump on Monday used her first solo appearance since becoming first lady again to urge passage by the Republican-controlled House, where it's pending.",
      "The Kansas House last month approved a bill that expands the definition of illegal sexual exploitation of a child to include possession of images generated with AI if they're \u201cindistinguishable from a real child, morphed from a real child\u2019s image or generated without any actual child involvement.\u201d",
      "A bill introduced in the Florida Legislature creates a new felony for people who use technology such as AI to generate nude images and criminalizes possession of child sexual abuse images generated with it. Broadly similar bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Maye Quade said she'll be sharing her proposal with legislators in other states because few are aware the technology is so readily accessible.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t get Congress to act, then we can maybe get as many states as possible to take action,\u201d Maye Quade said.",
      "Sandi Johnson, senior legislative policy counsel for the victim\u2019s rights group RAINN \u2014 the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network \u2014 said the Minnesota bill would hold websites accountable.",
      "\u201cOnce the images are created, they can be posted anonymously, or rapidly widely disseminated, and become nearly impossible to remove,\u201d she testified recently.",
      "Megan Hurley also was horrified to learn someone had generated explicit images and video of her using a \u201cnudification\u201d site. She said she feels especially humiliated because she's a massage therapist, a profession that's already sexualized in some minds.",
      "\u201cIt is far too easy for one person to use their phone or computer and create convincing, synthetic, intimate imagery of you, your family, and friends, your children, your grandchildren,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI do not understand why this technology exists and I find it abhorrent there are companies out there making money in this manner.\u201d",
      "However, two AI law experts \u2014 Wayne Unger of the Quinnipiac University School of Law and Riana Pfefferkorn of Stanford University's Institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence \u2014 said the Minnesota bill is too broadly constructed to survive a court challenge.",
      "Limiting the scope only to images of real children might help it withstand a First Amendment challenge since those are generally not protected, Pfefferkorn said. But she said it would still potentially conflict with a federal law that says you can't sue websites for content that users generate.",
      "\u201cIf Minnesota wants to go down this direction, they'll need to add a lot more clarity to the bill,\u201d Unger said. \u201cAnd they'll have to narrow what they mean by nudify and nudification.\u201d",
      "But Maye Quade said she thinks her legislation is on solid constitutional ground because it's regulating conduct, not speech.",
      "\u201cThis cannot continue,\" she said. \"These tech companies cannot keep unleashing this technology into the world with no consequences. It is harmful by its very nature.\u201d",

      "A private lunar lander has touched down on the moon, delivering a drill and other experiments for NASA",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions.",
      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon\u2019s northeastern edge of the near side.",
      "Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away.",
      "\u201cYou all stuck the landing. We\u2019re on the moon,\u201d Firefly\u2019s Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported.",
      "An upright and stable landing makes Firefly \u2014 a startup founded a decade ago \u2014 the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "A half hour after landing, Blue Ghost started to send back pictures from the surface, the first one a selfie somewhat obscured by the sun's glare. The second shot included the home planet, a blue dot glimmering in the blackness of space.",
      "Two other companies\u2019 landers are hot on Blue Ghost\u2019s heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week.",
      "Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies \u2014 had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company.",
      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",
      "It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades.",
      "NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realizing some missions will fail, said the space agency's top science officer Nicky Fox.",
      "\u201cIt really does open up a whole new way for us to get more science to space and to the moon,\" Fox said.",
      "Unlike NASA\u2019s successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",

      "The French defense minister says France is also seeking access to Ukraine\u2019s deposits of critical minerals, indicating that the United States isn\u2019t the only player",
      "PARIS -- France is also seeking access to Ukraine 's deposits of critical minerals, with negotiations already underway for months, the French defense minister said Thursday, indicating that the United States isn't the only player.",
      "Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected Friday at the White House to sign a minerals deal with the United States. President Donald Trump made the announcement Wednesday.",
      "But France, too, is in discussions with Ukraine \u2014 aiming, like the United States, to diversify its supplies of vital minerals, French Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu told broadcaster France Info.",
      "He didn't specify exactly which minerals France is seeking. Ukraine has been offering to supply the U.S. with rare earth elements that are critical for various technologies, including lithium for batteries and uranium for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons.",
      "Lecornu said: \u201cWe are speaking about this issue for our own French needs. I have defense industries that will need access to a certain number of raw materials in the years to come.\u201d",
      "He said French President Emmanuel Macron mandated him to begin the discussions and that he has been dealing directly with his Ukrainian counterpart as part of efforts to increase the number of source countries for rare minerals.",
      "\u201cWe have to diversify that. Emmanuel Macron has asked that I also start discussions with the Ukrainians .... I have been doing so since October,\u201d the minister said.",
      "He said France could possibly purchase minerals from Ukraine and isn't seeking access to them as a way to recoup the billions of euros (dollars) worth of military and other aid that Paris has supplied to strengthen Ukrainian defenses against Russia's invasion. Trump has framed the emerging deal as a chance for Kyiv to repay aid already sent under Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cWe are not looking for payback,\u201d Lecornu said. \u201cBut our defense sector will need a certain number of raw materials that are absolutely crucial in our own weapons systems ... for the next 30 or 40 years.\u201d",
      "He indicated that the discussions are in a preliminary stage, saying: \"It's the beginning of the story.\""

      "The FBI has accused North Korean-linked hackers of conducting one of the largest known thefts of cryptocurrency \u2014 worth some $1.5 billion from a Dubai-based firm",
      "ROME -- The FBI has accused North Korean-linked hackers of conducting one of the largest thefts of cryptocurrency publicly known, seizing some $1.5 billion worth of ethereum from a Dubai-based firm.",
      "The theft earlier this month targeting Bybit, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, represents yet another involving a team of hackers identified by the U.S. government by the names TraderTraitor and the Lazarus Group.",
      "The hackers steal cryptocurrency \u201cthrough the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that were modified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency,\u201d the FBI has said.",
      "In an online public service announcement late Wednesday, the FBI said it believed the North Korean-backed hackers were \u201cresponsible for the theft.\u201d",
      "\u201cTraderTraitor actors are proceeding rapidly and have converted some of the stolen assets to Bitcoin and other virtual assets dispersed across thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains,\u201d the FBI said in its announcement. \u201cIt is expected these assets will be further laundered and eventually converted to fiat currency.\u201d",
      "North Korean state media has not acknowledged either the theft or the FBI accusation. Pyongyang's mission to the United Nations in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "However, North Korea has stolen an estimated $1.2 billion in cryptocurrency and other virtual assets in the past five years, according to South Korea's spy agency. It represents a rare source of badly needed foreign currency to support its fragile economy and fund its nuclear program in the face of intense U.N. sanctions and North Korea's strict border closures during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "A U.N. experts panel separately said it was investigating 58 suspected cyberattacks by North Korea between 2017 to 2023 that saw some $3 billion stolen to \u201creportedly help to fund the country\u2019s development of weapons of mass destruction.\u201d",

The blockchain analytics firm Certik has described the theft as \u201cthe largest breach\u201d in the history of blockchain transactions.",
      "The theft has seen overall crypto prices drop in recent days as investors in part have been spooked by the hack despite the industry getting a boost from the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.

      "Unwanted phone calls are out of control",
      "LONDON -- Unwanted phone calls are out of control. Whether it's a robocall trying to sell you something or spam calls from scammers trying to rip you off, it's enough to make you want to stop answering your phone. So what can you do to stop them?",
      "The scourge of unwanted phone calls has been branded an epidemic by consumer groups, while the Federal Communications Commission says it's the top consumer complaint. The calls are a nuisance to many ordinary people, some of whom have complained to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI need help on getting spam calls to stop,\u201d one reader said in an email. She's getting up to 14 calls a day despite the countermeasures she's employed.",
      "As the name implies, robocalls are automated calls to deliver recorded messages to a large number of phones. A robocall purely to deliver a message or collect a debt is allowed under U.S. regulations, but the Federal Trade Commission says robocalls with a recorded voice trying to sell you something are illegal unless you've given explicit written permission to receive them. Many robocalls are also probably scams, the FTC warns.",
      "If you're flooded by unsolicited calls, here are some ways to fight back.",
      "Smartphone users can turn on some built-in settings to combat unknown calls.",
      "Apple advises iPhone users to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Go to your \u201cSettings,\u201d then scroll down to \u201cApps,\u201d and then to \u201cPhone,\u201d where you'll see it under the \u201cCalls\u201d section. When you turn this on, any calls from numbers that you've never been in touch with and aren't saved in your contacts list will not ring through. Instead, they'll be sent to voicemail and show up in your list of recent calls.",
      "Android has a similar setting that allows you to block calls from private or unidentified numbers, although you will still receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in your contact list.",
      "Just keep in mind that you could also end up not getting important calls, which sometimes come from unknown numbers.",
      "If an unwanted call does get through, both Android and iPhone users can block the individual phone number by tapping on it in the recent callers or call history list. You can also enter numbers directly into your phone's block list.",
      "Sign up for the national Do Not Call registry, which is a list of numbers that have opted out of most telemarketing calls. The Federal Trade Commission, which runs the registry, says it only contains phone numbers and holds no other personally identifiable information, nor does the registry know whether the number is for a landline or a cellphone.",
      "The FTC says there are some exemptions, including political calls, calls from non-profit groups and charities, and legitimate survey groups that aren't selling anything. Also allowed are calls from companies up to 18 months after you've done \u2014 or sought to do \u2014 business with them.",
      "But it also warns that while having your number on the registry will cut down on unwanted sales calls, it won\u2019t stop scammers from making illegal calls.",
      "Other countries have similar registries. Canada has its own Do Not Call list while the U.K. has the Telephone Preference Service.",
      "Check whether your wireless carrier has a call-blocking service. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, three of the biggest U.S. networks, all have their own call filters for customers to block robocalls and report spam. There's typically a free basic version and an advanced version that requires a subscription fee.",
      "If your phone company's filters aren't good enough, try third-party apps to weed out unwanted callers.",
      "There are a host of smartphone apps available that promise to block spam calls, like Nomorobo, YouMail, Hiya, RoboKiller, TrueCaller and others. Many charge a monthly or annual subscription fee but some offer a free basic option. Some also can be installed on landline phones, but only if they use VOIP technology, not copper cables.",
      "The Associated Press hasn't tested any of these apps and isn't making specific recommendations. We recommend you read user reviews and try some out for yourself.",
      "Apple says the apps work by comparing a caller's number with a list of known numbers and labeling them, for example, spam or telemarketing. Then it might automatically block the call. \u201cIncoming calls are never sent to third-party developers,\u201d the company says.",
      "Did you know you can file a complaint with the FCC about specific spam calls? You can do so easily through an online form. It might not give you immediate satisfaction, but the National Consumer Law Center says data on complaints is the best tool federal agencies have for determining how big a problem robocalls are.",
      "While companies you've done business with can make robocalls to you, the National Consumer Law Center says it's probably because you gave consent - possibly hidden in fine print. But you can also revoke your consent at any time.",
      "Just tell the company representative that you want to \u201crevoke consent,\u201d and if that doesn't stop them, contact customer service and tell them that you don't consent to receive calls and want your number added to the company's \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the center says.",
      "You might be tempted to try to engage with the call in an attempt to get your number off the call list or be put through to a real person. The FTC warns against doing this and recommends that you just hang up.",
      "\u201cPressing numbers to speak to someone or remove you from the list will probably only lead to more robocalls,\u201d the agency says on its advice page. \u201cAnd the number on your caller ID probably isn\u2019t real. Caller ID is easy to fake\" and can't be trusted, it says.",
      "Cybersecurity company Kaspersky advises not even saying anything when you receive what you think is a robocall. We've all received scammy calls that start with something like \u201cHello, can you hear me?\u201d to which you've probably replied \u201cyes\u201d without thinking.",
      "Scammers \u201ccan then store the recording of your confirmation and use it for fraudulent activities,\u201d Kaspersky says. \u201cSo, avoid saying yes where possible.\u201d",

      "\"The president is giving them an exemption for one month so they\u2019re not at an economic disadvantage,\" Leavitt said during a press conference at the White House.",
      "The tariffs are expected to pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada.",
      "While easing some tariffs, Trump criticized Canada on Wednesday for what he described as failure to take the steps necessary for the United States to withdraw all of the tariffs imposed a day earlier.",
      "Trump said he held a call with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday during which the two leaders discussed a path to U.S. withdrawal of the tariffs. Such an outcome would require sufficient action by Canada to address drug trafficking, Trump recounted relaying to Trudeau.",
      "A week ago, Trump alleged that illicit drugs such as fentanyl had continued to enter the U.S. through Mexico and Canada despite agreements reached last month to address the issue.",

      "Since September, nearly all fentanyl seized by the U.S. came through the Southern border with Mexico, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP, a federal agency. Less than 1% of fentanyl was seized at the Northern border with Canada, CBP found.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sharply criticized the tariffs on Tuesday, calling them a \"dumb\" policy that does not \"make sense.\"",
      "The reason for the tariffs is based on a false allegation about Canada as a major source of drugs entering the U.S., Trudeau added.",

      "\"If the U.S. truly wants to solve the fentanyl issue, then the right thing to do is to consult with China on the basis of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" Chinese spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference late Tuesday.",

      "Within minutes of the new U.S. tariffs taking effect, China unveiled on Tuesday its initial response by placing additional 10% to 15% tariffs on imported U.S. goods, like chicken, wheat, soybeans and beef.",
      "\"The retaliatory tariffs that China is imposing is very specific and directly targeted at American farmers, who are mostly in red states and mostly voted for Trump,\" Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, told ABC News.",
      "\"So China is trying to create pain where it matters for Trump, and it's hoping to get Trump to the negotiating table and offer relief for this group of Trump supporters,\" Thomas added.",
      "The recent duties will be placed on top of similar tariffs imposed by China during the first Trump administration's trade war in 2018. Some of those tariffs are already at 25%, though Beijing issued some waivers as a result of the 2020 \"phase one\" trade deal.",

      "Trump suggested he and Elon Musk would go there to check it out firsthand.",
      "President Donald Trump is casting doubt -- without providing evidence -- over whether much of the nation's store of gold still exists at the famous United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, raising questions about whether somebody \"stole\" it.",
      "What's more, he's said he wants to go to Fort Knox to see for himself.",
      "The ultra-secure facility holds approximately 147.3 million ounces of gold, according to the U.S. Mint.",
      "In raising questions, Trump is echoing Elon Musk, who has repeatedly questioned the whereabouts of the gold.",
      "Their expressed skepticism comes despite Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying that there is an audit every year and that \"all the gold is present and accounted for.\"",
      "It's also despite Trump's treasury secretary in his first term, Steven Mnuchin, personally visiting the reserves and confirming that the gold was there.",
      "Still, both Musk and Trump continue to raise questions without evidence.",
      "In an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast released Friday -- one of Musk's first comprehensive interviews since becoming a \"special government employee\" -- Musk repeated this suspicion.",
      "\"A live tour of Fort Knox would be awesome \u2026 is the gold there or not? They say it is -- is it real? Or did somebody spray paint some lead?\" he asked.",
      "In fact, these concerns appear to be brought to Musk's attention recently. On Feb. 15, he reacted to an X post that asked him to look into the gold supply, in which he responded, \"Surely it's reviewed at least every year?\"",
      "Fort Knox is a military base that has stored U.S. gold since 1937, according to the U.S. Army's website.",
      "Last week, Trump brought up the gold supply after being asked about Musk's most recent DOGE efforts.",
      "\"We have found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far. And we've just started. We're actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold. Tons of gold,\" Trump said.",
      "He raised it again at his recent meeting with the nation's governors at the White House on Feb. 21, saying that they plan to \"open the doors to Fort Knox.\"",
      "\"You grew up hearing about Fort Knox. You can't get in. You can't even see it. Nobody sees it. You go there and the place is dry,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump also referred to the site as the \"fabled Fort Knox\" while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One last week.",
      "Musk -- who has been tasked to eliminate government waste and fraud -- has repeatedly expressed suspicion about the gold bars.",
      "\"This gold is the property of the American people. I sure hope it's still there!\" he wrote on X last month. He has also repeatedly touted that the gold could have been stolen, asking on X, \"who is confirming that gold wasn't stolen from Fort Knox?\"",
      "Musk floated the idea of live-streaming a walkthrough of Fort Knox, responding to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' coverage of his comments by suggesting he'd like to film inside the vaults.",
      "He repeated this idea during the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, in addition to saying, \"part of this is also, you know, let's have some fun.\"",
      "During Musk's podcast appearance with Joe Rogan on Friday, Rogan asked the billionaire to think about his DOGE findings in relation to the gold.",
      "\"Think about all the other stuff that you pointed out.\u00a0All the checks that just go out, the NGO payments, the social security people \u2026 now apply that to the gold,\" Rogan said, to which Musk replied, \"absolutely.\"",
      "Not all members of Trump's administration share the same doubts.",
      "\"I think the gold is probably there. It's probably almost certainly there,\" David Sacks, Trump's crypto czar, told Fox News last week, though he still agreed with the president's calls to investigate the matter.",
      "\"Nobody thinks this is a crazy idea to go check because we don't know,\" Sacks added, arguing that \"we cannot fully trust that our gold is still in Fort Knox\" because of the \"corruption\" in Washington.",
      "According to the U.S. Mint, \"the only gold removed has been very small quantities used to test the purity of gold during regularly scheduled audits,\" and no other gold has been transferred to or from the depository \"for many years.\"",
      "The building was constructed using 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel, and 670 tons of structural steel, the U.S. Mint says.",
      "The gold is located at Fort Knox because it is \u201cfar from either coast, adjacent to a military installation for added security and close to a rail head for transportation,\u201d according to a fact sheet from the U.S. Mint.",
      "The depository has a strict no-visitors policy, as Trump alluded to, and even the president is restricted from accessing the vault. Former President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the only non-authorized person to obtain access.",
      "However, it first opened it in 1974 for journalists and a congressional delegation to view the reserves after rumors swirled surrounding the gold's whereabouts.",
      "\"We've never done this before and we'll probably never do it again,\" then-Director of the U.S. Mint Mary Brooks said after displaying the gold supply, according to a New York Times report following the visit.",
      "The second viewing came over 40 years later in 2017 during Trump's first administration. Then-Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were members of a delegation invited to view the gold.",
      "\"The gold was there when I visited it,\" Mnuchin said in Feb., adding that he's \"sure\" nobody's moved it and emphasizing the \"serious security protocols in place.\"",
      "Former Republican Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin -- who was present during this visit -- also attested to the gold being at Fort Knox.",
      "\"The reality is, there is an extraordinary amount of gold that is in there,\" Bevin told Fox News Business last week. He added that he agrees in transparency and that \"the people's wealth should be known and accounted for, no question.\"",
      "\"Is it possible that through the years things could be taken? It is,\" he admitted, before arguing that the building \"is so ridiculously secure that it is not possible to sneak anything out of there.\"",
      "Bevin also floated the possibility that Musk, as the world's richest man, may want to see what his riches look like \"in physical form.\"",
      "\"It is almost equivalent to how much his net worth is,\" Bevin said, admitting that he would want to see the gold, too, if he were Musk.",
      "There are \u201crestrictions on sharing any information related to the facility\u2019s security,\u201d according to documents detailing the 2017 visit\u2019s schedule and security measures published by CNN.",
      "\u201cAccess to the USBD is limited, as the facility exists solely for the storage of gold,\u201d the document said. \u201cTo prevent compromise of security, photographs will be subject to review by the U.S. Mint Police.\u201d",
      "\"The Treasury Secretary allows the visit when rumors persist that all the gold had been removed from the vaults,\" the U.S. Mint said in a statement.",
      "After affirming that \"all\" of the gold was present, Bessent said last month, \"any senator, they call the Treasury, we're happy to arrange a visit. They can do an inspection.\"",
      "According to the Treasury's monthly status report tracking gold owned by the Treasury, 147.3 million ounces of gold were recorded in Fort Knox as of Jan. 31, 2025.",
      "Fort Knox has also been utilized to temporarily store valuable historical items, such as the Declaration of Independence and Constitution during World War II, as well as the Magna Carta.",
      "The urgency to locate the gold comes despite the U.S. dollar no longer being linked to the value of gold. In 1971, Roosevelt ended the gold standard and switched to a fiat money system.",
      "However, the traditional belief that the U.S. dollar and gold have an inverse relationship still prevails. When the dollar weakens -- especially during times of inflation -- the value of gold is believed to increase.",
      "Rumors of the gold being missing or stolen have been a decades-long conspiracy theory.",
      "In 1971, Peter Beter, a lawyer and financial adviser to former President John F. Kennedy, alleged that British spies informed him that the gold in Fort Knox was secretly removed, the Washington Post reported.",
      "Beter's book, The Conspiracy Against the Dollar, continued to make such allegations that gold was missing. The 1974 visit, inviting journalists and congressmen to view the vault, followed soon after.",
      "The 1964 James Bond film, \"Goldfinger,\" also centers around a gold smuggler who is being investigated for scheming a break in of Fort Knox in an attempt to contaminate its gold supply.",
      "In 2010, then-Rep. Ron Paul of Texas was outspoken in his suspicions regarding the gold's whereabouts. He introduced the \"Gold Reserve Transparency Act of 2011\" which called for a full audit of U.S. gold reserves.",
      "When asked during an interview last month if he thinks the U.S. government has all the gold it claims to have, Paul said \"no, I don't. But I don't have evidence to prove it.\"",
      "\"Even if they showed us the gold, maybe the gold has been loaned out,\" Paul said, citing ways that the government can \"deceive the people.\"",
      "Musk has expressed support for Paul, even throwing his support behind calls for the former congressman to audit the gold.",
      "Last month, in response to X posts asking Paul to audit the Federal Reserve, Musk responded \"good idea\" and \"this will be great.\"",
      "Ron Paul's son, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, weighed in with a similar position to his father. Responding to Musk's tweet asking whether the Fort Knox gold supply is reviewed every year, Rand Paul responded, \"Nope. Let's do it.\"",
      "On Feb. 21, Rand Paul penned a letter to Bessent requesting to audit the gold reserves at Fort Knox.",
      "Appearing on \"Fox and Friends\" last month, Rand Paul acknowledged that the treasury secretary attested that the gold was there but emphasized the need for it to be audited, arguing \"the more transparency, the better.\"",
      "Musk appears to not mind that his claims are perceived to be tied to conspiracy theories.",
      "During The Joe Rogan Experience, the podcast episode opened with Rogan and Musk attempting to ask Musk's Grok AI machine if all the gold is still in Fort Knox. While Grok AI did not provide an answer, she asked if Musk was a \"conspiracy theorist\" to which the two shared bouts of laughter over.",
      "\"These conspiracy theories don't really spread per se on their own, beliefs in these conspiracy theories are instead a product of politicians and media elites sharing these ideas to trusting audiences who are already disposed toward believing them,\" Peter Uscinski, professor at University of Miami that specializes in conspiracy theories, told ABC News.",
      "\"Trump and his allies have shared numerous conspiracy theories over the past eight years; there is nothing new about this, and it ties in closely with Trump and Musk setting themselves up as people who are uncovering fraud in the government,\" Uscinski added.",

      "The Democratic mayors of Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York City on Wednesday pushed back against House Republicans' claims that they are harboring dangerous immigrants and violating immigration laws as so-called \"sanctuary cities.\"",
      "During a House Oversight Committee hearing on Wednesday, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and New York City Mayor Eric Adams all defended their actions on immigration enforcement in their respective cities as Republicans on the committee accused them of increasing crime and impeding on law enforcement actions.",
      "Chairman James Comer, a Republican, said these mayors lead towns that have policies that only create \"sanctuary for criminals\" and promised to hold them accountable for \"their failure to follow the law and protect the American people.\" Comer and other Republicans on the committee suggested that the mayors should be doing more to cooperate with the Trump administration and its deportation efforts.",
      "Sanctuary cities still enforce U.S. federal immigration laws, but the term often refers to a limited collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while enacting policies that are more favorable to undocumented people.",
      "\"As mayor, I do not control who enters or remains in our country, but I do have to manage the population that is within our city,\" said Adams, who said as New York City mayor he is working with the Trump administration on immigration aid. \"In order to carry out this function without having long term negative ramification, I must create an atmosphere that allows every law-abiding resident, documented or not, to access vital services without fear of being turned over to federal authorities.\"",
      "Wu said that the Trump administration is making \"hard-working, tax-paying, God-fearing residents afraid to live their lives.\"",
      "\"A city that scared is not a city that's safe. A land ruled by fear is not the land of the free,\" Wu said.",
      "Democrats immediately criticized the Trump administration, arguing the overreach of federal officials has led to unlawful detentions and created fear in communities.",
      "\"Let's be clear, the state and local laws that Republicans have issue with today are in full compliance with federal law. They do not obstruct ICE from carrying out its duties, and they are backed by evidence demonstrating that they keep people safe,\" Ranking Member Gerry Connolly said.",
      "Wednesday's committee hearing comes as President Donald Trump's administration officials have ramped up their immigration enforcement efforts with Attorney General Pam Bondi shutting down federal grants to sanctuary cities and multiple threats from \"border czar\" Tom Homan toward these mayors if they refuse to comply.",
      "At the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Homan criticized Boston and its police commissioner, saying he'll be \"bringing hell\" to the city over its sanctuary city policy.",
      "\"Let's talk about Tom Homan,\" Wu said Wednesday. \"Shame on him for lying about my city, for having the nerve to insult our police commissioner who has overseen the safest Boston's been in anyone's lifetime. Bring him here under oath, and let's ask him some questions.\"",
      "The mayors pushed back heavily on assertions from Republicans that they are welcoming criminals into their cities, blaming the Trump administration for labeling immigrants as criminals and pushing misleading crime statistics.",
      "\"If you wanted to make us safe, pass gun reforms,\" Wu later added. \"Stop cutting Medicaid. Stop cutting cancer research. Stop cutting funds for veterans. That is what will make our cities safe.\"",

    "story": [
      "Regarding surprise medical bills, Trump previously said, \"This must end.\"",
      "As President Donald Trump wrapped up his first term in 2020, he signed a legislation to protect Americans from surprise medical bills. \"This must end,\" Trump said. \"We're going to hold insurance companies and hospitals totally accountable.\"",
      "But the president's wide-ranging push to slash government spending, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is weakening the federal office charged with implementing the No Surprises Act.",
      "Some 15% of those working at the federal Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, or CCIIO, were fired two weeks ago, according to the agency's former deputy director in charge of operations, Jeff Grant.",
      "And while the full impact of the cutbacks is still coming into focus, the retrenchment is threatening work at an agency already laboring to run an overstretched system for resolving sometimes very large bills from out-of-network medical providers.",
      "\"It's a hot mess,\" Grant said of the job cuts in an interview with KFF Health News. \"The chaos has put everyone in a tailspin.\"",
      "The cuts, which affected 82 of the federal office's employees, also risk delaying critical new rules designed to speed the process of adjudicating disputes over surprise bills between health plans and medical providers.",
      "Grant, who was the top career official at CCIIO, retired last week after 41 years in government. He blasted the layoffs as a \"grievous error\" in a strongly worded letter to the acting human resources director, criticizing him for cutting jobs without regard for the qualifications of employees or the needs of the agency.",
      "Health insurers have also raised concerns about maintaining the agency's work on the surprise bills.",
      "Spokespeople for the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., did not respond to questions about the job cuts.",
      "The CCIIO, a small part of the federal health agency, was created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act and charged with ensuring that health insurance plans meet standards established by the law to protect patients.",
      "After Congress passed the No Surprises Act in 2020, the office assumed additional responsibility for setting up and administering the complex process for protecting patients from surprise bills.",
      "The work drew support from Democrats and Republicans, who'd been inundated with stories of patients hit by huge bills from emergency physicians, anesthesiologists, and other providers who were not in patients' insurance networks, even when patients received care at in-network hospitals.",
      "\"We will end surprise medical billing,\" Trump promised on the campaign trail in 2020. \"The days of ripping off patients are over.\"",
      "The law barred medical providers in most cases from pursuing patients over surprise bills. This prohibition is not directly affected by the recent job cuts ordered by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, created by Trump through an executive order.",
      "But the CCIIO had been working to streamline a system established by the No Surprises Act to resolve disagreements between health plans and medical providers over out-of-network bills. This key protection was put in place so patients would not be caught in the middle of billing disputes.",
      "The system, known as independent dispute resolution, or IDR, has been inundated with hundreds of thousands of cases. In 2023, more than 650,000 new disputes were filed, according to a recent analysis published in the journal Health Affairs.",
      "\"The No Surprises Act has protected millions of Americans from receiving surprise medical bills,\" said Jennifer Jones, who directs legislative policy at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, an insurance trade group. \"But issues with the independent dispute resolution process,\" she added, \"are driving up costs for patients and employers.\"",
      "Also overwhelmed has been a consumer reporting system designed to allow patients to lodge complaints if they feel they have been unfairly targeted with a surprise bill.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the CCIIO had been working on new rles to make dispute resolution more efficient, which experts said would make a difference.",
      "\"If this rule becomes final and works as well as intended, it should help more out-of-network claims get resolved,\" said Jack Hoadley, an emeritus research professor at Georgetown University, who has studied surprise medical billing.",
      "But the new rules weren't finished before Biden left office. And the senior official overseeing this work left his job in January. The recent cuts hit the remaining CCIIO staffers working on the No Surprises Act, according to Grant and other sources familiar with the layoffs, who asked not to be identified out of fear of professional retaliation.",
      "Grant said senior CCIIO officials were since able to shift some employees around and got permission to recall some of the 82 people let go. But he said there is no guarantee that all of them will want to come back to the diminished agency.",
      "Even more concerning, Grant said, are deeper cuts that the White House has told federal agencies to prepare for by March 13.",
      "\"These cuts were pretty bad,\" Grant said. \"What happens next will be even more important.\"",

      "\"Grocery and home prices are going up, not down. And he hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either of those.\" she said. \"His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber and cars and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers. Your premiums and prescriptions will cost more, because the math on his proposals doesn't work without going after your health care. Meanwhile, for those keeping score, the national debt is going up, not down,\" she said.",

      "Slotkin also commented on Trump's heated exchange with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office last week, saying former President Ronald Reagan \"must be rolling in his grave\" after the near-screaming match. She also argued that Trump's approach that day speaks to his \"whole approach to the world.\"",
      "\"In closing, we all know that our country is going through something right now. We're not sure what the next day is going to hold. Let alone the next decade,\" she said.\" But this isn't the first time we've experienced significant and tumultuous change as a country. I'm a student of history, and we've gone through periods of political instability before, and ultimately we've chosen to keep changing this country for the better.\"",

      "Trump opened his address by declaring to Congress and the nation: \"America is back.\"",
      "A chant of \"USA\" immediately broke out among lawmakers as Republicans rose to their feet.",
      "Trump quickly turned to touting the lightning speed with which he's sought to enact his agenda, arguing his administration's \"accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years -- and we are just getting started.\"",
      "Trump spoke about the 2024 election, claiming a wide \"mandate\" though data shows the victory isn't the total landslide he's often portrayed.",
      "When Trump said he won the popular vote by \"large numbers,\" Democrats began audibly pushing back. Rep. Al Green of Texas was seen out of his seat and shaking his cane at Trump as he shouted, \"There's no mandate.\"",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson was slamming his gavel to restore order to the joint session and issued a warning to members to maintain decorum. Johnson shortly after instructed Green be removed from the chamber by the sergeant at arms after telling him to take his seat several times.",
      "The back-and-forth between Trump and Democrats continued throughout the speech. At one point, Trump lashed out at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, bringing back his 2018 taunt of calling her \"Pocahontas.\"",
      "Democrats held up signs that said \"false\" and \"Musk steals.\" Several walked out of the chamber as he was speaking.",
      "Trump repeatedly went after former President Joseph Biden, continuing to criticize him for issues at the border or with the economy.",
      "\"The worst president in American history,\" Trump said of Biden.",
      "Trump is only six weeks into his second term, but already Americans are expressing dissatisfaction with many of his policies. A 538 analysis of public opinion polls found his approval rating on actions related to health care, foreign policy, government funding, trade and more to be underwater.",
      "Elon Musk, a controversial but highly influential adviser in Trump's orbit, was in the chamber for Trump's remarks. He left the White House for the speech moments before Trump and, like the president, received applause upon his arrival though it was more muted.",
      "Trump spent a considerable amount of time early in his remarks praising Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency's work slashing government spending and the federal workforce.",
      "\"The brand-new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE. Perhaps you've heard of it. Perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you Elon. He's working very hard. He didn't need this. He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side appreciates it, I believe,\" Trump said.",
      "The president read a laundry list of the alleged \"waste, fraud and abuse\" he claims DOGE has identified. He made several misleading claims about Social Security in the process, including that millions of Americans over the age of 100 were receiving benefits, which has been debunked.",
      "Trump claimed DOGE's work will help the economy overall.",
      "\"By slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors, and put more money in the pockets of American families,\" he said.",
      "After hammering Biden on the economy during the 2024 campaign and pledging to voters to bring down prices on Day 1, Trump didn't spend much time discussing how exactly he'd lower prices as he continued to lay blame on Biden.",
      "\"As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again,\" Trump said in one of his only mentions of grocery prices. \"Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg price is out of control, and we're working hard to get it back down.\"",
      "The comment again sparked pushback from Democrats. The price of eggs has skyrocketed under Trump amid an avian flu outbreak.",
      "Trump said the focus on how to defeat inflation will be on reducing the cost of energy and taxpayer savings through DOGE.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, offered a defense of his tariffs against Canada, China and Mexico -- which sent markets roiling on Tuesday. He said more \"reciprocal\" tariffs were in store.",
      "\"Tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs they're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again,\" he said.",
      "Trump saved foreign policy for the end of his address. He again said his administration would \"reclaim\" the Panama Canal for national security reasons, and said they were trying to get Greenland for similar reasons.",
      "After an explosive meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office last week, Trump said he received from Zelenskyy earlier Tuesday and read part of it aloud.",
      "\"I appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago,\" Trump said, appearing to signal tensions have cooled a bit.",
      "\"Simultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. Wouldn't that be beautiful?\" he said.",
      "Trump also briefly touched on the Middle East, saying his administration is working to bring back hostages held in Gaza and that he wants to build on his 2019 Abraham Accords to bring stability to the region.",

      "Guides from the heli-skiing company attempted to locate the skiers. Using avalanche beacons, the guides identified a probable area where the skiers were buried, at a depth of 40 feet (12 meters) to 100 feet (30 meters), McDaniel said in a later email.",
      "\u201cThe guides were unable to recover the three skiers due to the depth. Due to considerable avalanche risk in this area and limited daylight, no further recovery operations were conducted on March 4,\u201d he said. \u201cIf weather and conditions allow for it, Troopers plan to assess avalanche conditions from the air and determine recovery options with individuals that have experience making avalanche recoveries.\"",

      "Officials say roughly 650 Marines and Army soldiers who were forced out of the military for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine have so far expressed interest in returning to the force under an executive order from President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Roughly 650 Marines and Army soldiers who were forced out of the military for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine have so far expressed interest in returning to the force under an executive order from President Donald Trump, officials said this week.",
      "The number represents about 8% of the roughly 8,200 troops who had been discharged. The total, officials say, confirms military leaders' early view that many troops have moved on with their lives. They have been allowed to rejoin since 2023, and Trump's offer of providing back pay may be a factor in spurring a bit more interest now.",
      "The Army and Marine Corps have been sending out emails, texts and phone calls to service members discharged for refusing a pandemic-era order to get the vaccine. The Navy and the Air Force are planning to begin their efforts to contact service members, but are waiting for additional guidance. The totals would likely increase once their formal notices go out.",
      "Officials stressed that the numbers are very preliminary because troops have only expressed interest in reenlisting and haven't actually taken steps to formally do so. They will have to go through the enlistment procedure again, pass all required legal and moral standards and physical fitness requirements, and agree to reenlist for at least two years.",
      "Trump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return. In an executive order signed a week after he took office, Trump said that the mandate cost the military \u201csome of our best people\u201d and he vowed to \u201crehire every patriot who was fired from the military with \u2026 backpay.\u201d",
      "Under Trump's directive, those who were discharged for refusing the vaccine can rejoin and get back pay. Those who voluntarily left to avoid the vaccine also can rejoin, but they must swear that they left the service for that reason and they will not receive back pay.",
      "Two years ago, the military services sent out notices to all troops discharged for refusing the vaccine, advising them they could return to the military. Just 113 reenlisted.",
      "As a result of those notices:",
      "\u2014 Of the 3,748 Marines discharged, 25 opted to re-enlist.",

      "\u2014 Of the 1,878 sailors discharged, two returned.",
      "\u2014 Of the 671 airmen discharged, 13 returned.",
      "In mid-February, the Defense Department told the military services to reach out once again to service members who were forced out or voluntarily left the military because of the COVID-19 vaccine and see if they want to reenlist. This time it came with the financial incentive.",
      "The Marine Corps set up a special team and has sent emails and text messages to those who were discharged. As of Wednesday, spokesman Jim Edwards said 553 Marines have responded.

      "Mississippi\u2019s first Black lawmaker of the 20th century died Tuesday",
      "LEXINGTON, Miss. -- Robert G. Clark, who was elected in 1967 as Mississippi's first Black lawmaker of the 20th century and rose to the second-highest leadership role in the state House of Representatives, died Tuesday at age 96, his son said.",
      "Rep. Bryant Clark, who succeeded Robert Clark, said his father died of natural causes at home in Holmes County, north of Jackson.",
      "A teacher and descendant of slaves, Clark was ostracized during his first years at the state Capitol, relegated to sitting solo at a two-person desk in the House chamber and ignored by white colleagues at social events.",
      "By the time he left office 36 years later, he had served as chairman of both the House Ethics Committee and the powerful Education Committee. In a state where nearly 40% of residents are Black, he saw more Black candidates win seats as voting rights were enforced and more majority-Black districts were drawn, sometimes under court order.",
      "Clark also won the respect and support of colleagues, Black and white, who elected him in January 1992 to House speaker pro tempore, a position he retained until he retired in 2004.",
      "Clark was among five activists and elected officials honored in February 2018 during a black-tie-optional gala at the newly opened Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.",
      "The glitzy event was a lifetime away from Clark\u2019s hardscrabble early days, when most of his relatives worked in cotton fields on family land in Holmes County. As a small child, he would sit by the side of the field with his elderly grandfather, William Clark, who was born a slave and shared vivid memories of deprivation.",
      "\u201cHe had never owned a pair of pants or shoes until after slavery,\u201d Robert Clark told The Associated Press in a 2018 interview. \u201cTheir feed was poured over to them in a trough just like we feed hogs, and they had to get down and eat the best way they could.\u201d",
      "That grandfather's wisdom, he said, helped give him the sense of self to become a leader.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d throw a hand of corn over and the chickens would be eating. I\u2019d throw another hand of corn over there, and chickens would leave that hand of corn and run to another hand,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd I asked him, \u2018Grandpa, why them old crazy chickens got corn and just run to the other corn?\u2019 He said, \u2018Young man, they\u2019re just following the crowd.\u2019 And he said, \u2018That\u2019s something I never want you to do.\u2018",
      "\u201cAnd from feeding the chickens, that became a part of me \u2014 not just following the group.\u201d",
      "Clark went to Michigan to earn a master\u2019s degree in education, and then fulfilled a promise he had made to older relatives by returning to the family land in Mississippi. As a teacher and coach, he often went into his athletes\u2019 homes.",
      "\u201cI realized many of the parents could not help their children with the lessons,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd I went to the superintendent of education to ask him if he would implement an adult education program. And he told me, \u2018No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the best interest of the county to do that.\u2019\u201d",
      "After the all-white local school board denied Clark's request to start the program that would primarily help Black adults, he announced his candidacy for that board. Maneuvering to keep a Black man off the board, the local state representative got a change in state law to make that school board appointed rather than elected. Rather than accept defeat, Clark ran against that representative, and made history by winning.",
      "Because Black people were generally not accepted in the Democratic Party that controlled Mississippi, Clark\u2019s family had belonged to what they called the \u201cBlack and Tan\" segment of the Republican Party when he was a child. With allegiances flipping in the late 1960s, he ran his first legislative race as an independent. Only later would he run, and win, as a Democrat.",
      "On inauguration day in January 1968, Clark didn\u2019t know if he would be allowed to take his oath. The white candidate he defeated had filed a complaint claiming he didn't live in Holmes County, where his family had lived for generations.",
      "Clark arrived at the Capitol with his attorney, Marian Wright, who later founded the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, a national advocacy group for the poor. They were standing near a statue of the late Theodore Bilbo, an arch-segregationist who had served as Mississippi governor and U.S. senator, when they were told about 10 minutes before the ceremony that Clark would be sworn in.",
      "The ornate House chamber, with marble walls and stained-glass windows, was filled with two-person oak desks where seatmates swapped gossip and often became fast friends. In January 1968, in deeply segregated Mississippi, the senior member of Clark\u2019s local legislative delegation decreed that Clark would sit by himself.",
      "The isolation extended to group dinners for legislators: \u201cNobody would sit with me,\u201d Clark said.",
      "Sitting alone at tables set for six or eight created a dilemma, he recalled: \"I very shortly went up to 240 pounds. I didn\u2019t intend to gain weight. I just wasn\u2019t going to leave all that food on the table.\u201d",
      "Clark and his first wife, Essie, had two sons \u2014 Robert G. Clark III and Wandrick Bryant Clark. She died of cancer in 1977, and he raised their sons as a widower, homeschooling them and taking them to the state Capitol while the Legislature was in session.",
      "About 19 years after her death, Clark married Jo Ann Ross. In 2003, he chose not to seek re-election, and the seat was won by his second son. Bryant Clark also continued to practice law. Robert G. Clark III, meanwhile, served as a chancery judge in four counties.",

      "Republicans in Congress are taking aim at four cities over their policies limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement under Preident Donald Trump's administation",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans in Congress are taking aim at four cities \u2014 often called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 over their policies limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement with a hearing this week that comes as President Donald Trump presses ahead with his campaign of mass deportations.",
      "Mayors Michelle Wu of Boston, Brandon Johnson of Chicago, Mike Johnston of Denver and Eric Adams of New York are set to appear Wednesday in front of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.",
      "There\u2019s no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces U.S. immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help, particularly for large-scale deportations, requesting that police and sheriffs alert them to people it wants to deport and hold them until federal officers take custody.",
      "But some cities and states say cooperating with ICE means victims of crime and witnesses who aren\u2019t in the U.S. legally won\u2019t come forward. And, to varying degrees, officials argue that they want their localities to be welcoming places for immigrants.",
      "Courts have repeatedly upheld the legality of most sanctuary laws. But Trump administration officials have targeted sanctuary policies right out of the gate in his second term, seeing them as a key impediment to deporting people in the large numbers he wants. The administration has sued Chicago and Illinois as well as New York state over various immigration laws.",
      "Here's a look at the immigration policies and migration trends of the cities whose mayors will appear Wednesday:",
      "The city's Trust Act generally restricts how much the police can cooperate with ICE, although it does allow some cooperation with a division called Homeland Security Investigations when it comes to such issues as combating human trafficking or drug and weapons trafficking.",
      "The city also must follow a 2017 ruling by the state\u2019s highest court that forbids Massachusetts authorities from holding a person otherwise entitled to release from custody based solely on a federal request.",
      "Those requests, called detainers, typically ask federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies to give at least 48 hours\u2019 notice before suspected immigrants are released from jail \u2014 or to hold them for up to 48 hours after they would normally be released so ICE can pick them up. Otherwise, ICE must go out into the community to arrest them.",
      "Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, hammered Boston\u2019s police commissioner and promised to go to Boston and \u201cbring hell\" with him.",
      "That has not sat well in Boston.",
      "Wu, a Democrat up for reelection this year, said that it was \u201cclueless\u201d and \u201cinsulting\u201d for Homan to attack the police commissioner and that she wants Boston be a welcoming place for immigrants.",
      "Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden said handing over defendants makes it harder to gain cooperation from immigrants when investigating crimes.",
      "Chicago has some of the country\u2019s strongest immigrant protections, barring cooperation between federal agents and city employees, including police.",
      "The nation\u2019s third-largest city became a sanctuary location in the 1980s and has amped up its policies multiple times since. That includes a 2012 ordinance that bars federal agents from accessing city resources in assisting with immigration operations.",
      "City officials beefed up protections after Trump first took office in 2017 and again in 2020, when it required police to document requests for assistance from federal agents. Illinois also has protections allowing anyone, regardless of immigration status, to get a driver's license.",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson, who took office in 2023, inherited a migrant crisis his first year. Short on shelter space, Chicago\u2019s leaders used police station lobbies, airports, parked buses and hotels to house asylum-seekers.",
      "At its height, roughly 15,000 migrants lived in dozens of temporary shelters, although the city has shuttered those as the number of people arriving decreased.",
      "There have been a handful of City Council attempts to weaken Chicago\u2019s sanctuary protections, but they have been unsuccessful in the Democratic-leaning city.",
      "Johnson has defended the policies.",
      "\u201cWe welcome all individuals and families who want to work, live and thrive here in our beloved city,\u201d Johnson said in late January.",
      "Denver became a hub for immigrants coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, with the city seeing arrivals of 43,000 over the last two years.",
      "Mayor Mike Johnston struggled to cobble together the resources to house and feed them, gouging parts of the city budget and pleading with the federal government alongside other mayors for funding, which only partially came.",
      "The spotlight ratcheted up when a video of armed men in an apartment building in the Denver suburb of Aurora went viral, prompting then-candidate Trump to claim that the city of some 400,000 people was overrun by a Venezuelan gang.",
      "The idea was swiftly repudiated by local officials, but the limelight stayed on Colorado.",
      "In early February, heavily armed federal agents in masks and armored vehicles appeared across the metro area. The results of the operation are unclear, and Homan said news media leaks hindered the raids.",
      "The mayor has repeated that he wants Denver to be a welcoming place while drawing the line at those who commit violent crimes.",
      "Last month, Denver Public Schools became the first district to sue the Trump administration over its policy allowing ICE immigration agents in schools.",
      "In New York City, an estimated 231,000 immigrants have arrived since 2022 \u2014 at a cost that the city estimates to be more than $7 billion for shelters, food, security and legal support.",
      "Last month, the city sued the Trump administration over $80.6 million in reimbursements for congressionally approved immigrant aid after officials paid the money and then clawed it back.",
      "As in other cities, New York's immigrant arrivals have fallen dramatically over the past year.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams continues to voice support for policies that ensure all residents have access to social services regardless of immigration status.",
      "But Adams wants to roll back policies prohibiting city employees from working with immigration enforcement, saying he wants to \u201cremove dangerous people from our streets.\u201d He's also called on the City Council to make changes allowing New York to honor ICE detainer requests to hold people in jails beyond their release dates. And he's invited ICE agents to work out of the Rikers Island city jail.",
      "Adams\u2019 critics, including those running for mayor, say his desire to work with the White House is an effort to wriggle out of federal corruption charges.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The State Department on Tuesday reinstated the \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d designation for Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi group, fulfilling an order announced by President Donald Trump shortly after he took office.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the department had restored the designation, which carries with it sanctions and penalties for anyone providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d for the group.",
      "\u201cSince 2023, the Houthis have launched hundreds of attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, as well as U.S. service members defending freedom of navigation and our regional partners,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"Most recently, the Houthis spared Chinese-flagged ships while targeting American and allied vessels.\u201d",
      "The Houthis have targeted more than 100 merchant vessels in the critical trade corridor with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. In January, the group signaled that it will limit its attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip but warned wider assaults could resume if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s first Republican administration had similarly designated the Houthis in its waning days, but the designation had been revoked by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration over concerns it would badly affect the delivery of aid to Yemen, which was considered to be facing one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.",
      "The United Nations said last month that it suspended its humanitarian operations in the stronghold of Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels after they detained eight more U.N. staffers.",
      "The rebels in recent months have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen\u2019s capital. None of the U.N. staffers has been released.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis have been fighting Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they descended from their stronghold in Saada and took control of Sanaa and most of the north."

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The South Carolina Supreme Court has rejected what is likely the final appeal of condemned man Brad Sigmon, clearing the way for Friday's firing squad execution.",
      "Sigmon's lawyers wanted to delay his death so they could get a fuller hearing in court to learn more information about the drug South Carolina uses in lethal injections. Sigmon said that lack of information forced him to choose to be shot to death. The state also has an electric chair, but Sigmon said he didn't want to suffer being cooked alive by electricity.",
      "Sigmon's attorneys also argued that his lawyers in the original 2002 trial did a poor job of trying to save his life after he pleaded guilty by not submitting enough evidence of his mental problems.",
      "Sigmon, 67, beat his ex-girlfriend's parents to death with a baseball bat in their Greenville County home. His plan was to kidnap his ex-girlfriend, spend a romantic weekend together and then kill her and himself. She escaped from his car as he drove away.",
      "\"If I couldn\u2019t have her, I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody else have her. And I knew it got to the point where I couldn\u2019t have her,\u201d Sigmon said in a confession typed out by a detective after his arrest.",
      "Sigmon will be strapped into a chair at 6 p.m. Friday in the death chamber used for all South Carolina executions at Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia. A target will be placed over his heart and a hood over his head. Three shooters, all with live ammunition, will fire from 15 feet (4.6 meters) away.",
      "Sigmon would be the first inmate killed by firing squad in the U.S. in 15 years.",
      "Lawyers for Sigmon said in court papers that he chose a violent death by firing squad because, without more information, he thought he would die a tortuous death if he picked lethal injection.",
      "Autopsies from two inmates executed in the months since South Carolina changed its method of lethal injection to massive amounts of pentobarbital showed a considerable amount of fluid in their lungs. A defense expert testified the inmates could have suffered struggling to breathe.",
      "But lawyers for the state have said fluid is often found in the lungs of prisoners killed by lethal injections and other courts have not ruled it was cruel and unusual punishment. They also said witnesses at the executions, including the inmates' attorneys, did not report any breathing or signs of consciousness after about a minute.",
      "Prison officials also told the doctor conducting the autopsy that both Marion Bowman, who was executed on Jan. 31, and Richard Moore, executed on Nov. 1, needed twice the dose of the lethal injection drug typically used in other states and by the federal government.",
      "In Moore's case, two doses were given 11 minutes apart. In Bowman's execution, it wasn't clear the time range, although a witness heard talking 10 minutes after the execution began.",
      "\u201cThere is no justice here. Everything about this barbaric, state-sanctioned atrocity \u2014 from the choice to the method itself \u2014 is abjectly cruel. We should not just be horrified \u2014 we should be furious,\u201d defense attorney Gerald \u201cBo\u201d King said in a statement,",
      "South Carolina has a shield law that keeps the suppliers of its lethal injection drugs, the members of the execution team and the procedure used to kill an inmate secret, so it isn't known if South Carolina's new protocol requires two doses of pentobarbital.",
      "Sigmon also plans to ask Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to commute his death sentence to life in prison. His lawyers said he is a model prisoner trusted by guards and works every day to atone for the killings he committed after succumbing to severe mental illness.",
      "McMaster will make his decision moments before the execution starts. No South Carolina governor has granted clemency in the 49 years since the death penalty restarted."

      "ATLANTA -- Georgia U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath filed paperwork on Wednesday to raise money for a run for governor in 2026, becoming the first Democrat to take that step.",
      "McBath described her effort as an exploratory committee, although that could quickly become a full-blown campaign. The four-term member of Congress is best known as a gun control advocate.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp is completing his second term and can't run again. On the Republican side, Attorney General Chris Carr is already running for governor in 2026 and Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is widely expected to run.",
      "Other Democrats who have been exploring a run include former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, state Sen. Jason Esteves and former DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Michael Thurmond. Democrat Stacey Abrams, who ran and lost to Kemp in 2018 and 2022, has not closed the door on a third run.",
      "McBath first won election to Congress in 2018, ousting Republican U.S. Rep Karen Handel to seize a seat in Atlanta's northern suburbs once held by Newt Gingrich. When Republicans redrew electoral districts after the 2020 Census, McBath jumped into a primary race against fellow Democrat Carolyn Bordeaux, beating her handily and winning election. Then after a court ordered another round of redistricting after finding African American votes were diluted, McBath shifted to a district Republicans drew on the western side of Atlanta.",
      "Those moves mean McBath has represented a much larger number of voters than the typical member of Congress, which could make her a stronger statewide candidate.",
      "McBath, like Abrams, would be bidding to become the first Black female governor of an American state. While that remains a difficult hurdle to cross, McBath is likely to have advantages as a Black woman in a Democratic primary in Georgia, where Black women are the backbone of the party.",
      "But McBath also tries to cultivate bipartisan appeal, especially with suburban swing voters. She was one of four Georgia Democrats earlier this year who voted for the Laken Riley Act, named for a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student who was killed last year by a Venezuelan man in the U.S. illegally. The law was the first that President Donald Trump signed in his second term and makes it easier to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have been accused of crimes.",
      "\u201cGeorgians deserve a Governor who understands what\u2019s at stake \u2014 because they\u2019ve lived it,\u201d McBath said in a statement Thursday. \u201cAs a mom and breast cancer survivor, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how regular people are too often left out of the political process. I look forward to continuing this conversation with my neighbors and fellow Georgians.\u201d",
      "The 64-year-old McBath rose to prominence as a gun control advocate after her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed in 2012 by a white man who was angry over the loud music the Black teenager and his friends were playing at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station. McBath, a former flight attendant, has had her political career heavily backed by billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.",
      "She touts her support of a 2022 law that toughens background checks for the youngest gun buyers, keeps firearms from more domestic violence offenders and helps states enact red flag laws making it easier for authorities to take weapons from people judged dangerous.",
      "McBath led a group of survivors and family members of victims of gun violence who spoke in a prime-time slot at the 2024 Democratic National Convention."

      "Tuesday was the eruption's 12th episode. What began in the morning with sporadic, small flows became continuous fountaining in the afternoon, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said. They reached 150 to 165 feet (45 to 60 meters) and were expected to grow.",
      "A webcam showed a vigorous fountain of bright red lava.",
      "No residential areas have been threatened by the eruption. People have been flocking to overlook sites inside the park for views of the fiery show.",
      "The length of time for each fountaining episode has varied from several hours to several days. Episodes have been separated by pauses lasting from less than 24 hours to 12 days, according to the observatory.",

      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a fight over plans to store nuclear waste at sites in rural Texas and New Mexico",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday in a fight over plans to store nuclear waste at sites in rural Texas and New Mexico.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration and a private company with a license for the Texas facility appealed a ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that found that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission exceeded its authority in granting the license. The outcome of the case will affect plans for a similar facility in New Mexico roughly 40 miles (65 kilometers) away.",
      "On this issue, President Donald Trump's administration is sticking with the views of its predecessor, even with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican ally of Trump, on the other side.",
      "The push for temporary storage sites is part of the complicated politics of the nation\u2019s so far futile quest for a permanent underground storage facility.",
      "Here's what to know about the case:",
      "Roughly 100,000 tons (90,000 metric tons) of spent fuel, some of it dating from the 1980s, is piling up at current and former nuclear plant sites nationwide and growing by more than 2,000 tons (1,800 metric tons) a year. The waste was meant to be kept there temporarily before being deposited deep underground.",
      "A plan to build a national storage facility northwest of Las Vegas at Yucca Mountain has been mothballed because of staunch opposition from most Nevada residents and officials.",
      "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said that the temporary storage sites are needed because existing nuclear plants are running out of room. The presence of the spent fuel also complicates plans to decommission some plants, the Justice Department said in court papers.",
      "The NRC granted the Texas license to Interim Storage Partners LLC for a facility that could take up to 5,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel rods from power plants and 231 million tons of other radioactive waste. The facility would be built next to an existing dump site in Andrews County for low-level waste such as protective clothing and other material that has been exposed to radioactivity. The Andrews County site is about 350 miles (560 kilometers) west of Dallas, near the Texas-New Mexico state line.",
      "The New Mexico facility would be in Lea County, in the southeastern part of the state near Carlsbad. The NRC gave a license for the site to Holtec International.",
      "The licenses would allow for 40 years of storage, although opponents contend the facilities would be open indefinitely because of the impasse over permanent storage.",
      "Republicans and Democrats, environmental groups and the oil and gas industry all oppose the temporary sites.",
      "Abbott is leading Texas' opposition to the storage facility. New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also is opposed to the facility planned for her state.",
      "A brief led by Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on behalf of several lawmakers calls the nuclear waste contemplated for the two facilities an \u201centicing target for terrorists\u201d and argues it's too risky to build the facility atop the Permian Basin, the giant oil and natural gas region that straddles Texas and New Mexico.",
      "Elected leaders of communities on the routes the spent fuel likely would take to New Mexico and Texas also are opposed.",
      "The justices will consider whether, as the NRC argues, the states forfeited their right to object to the licensing decisions because they declined to join in the commission\u2019s proceedings.",
      "Two other federal appeals courts, in Denver and Washington, that weighed the same issue ruled for the agency. Only the 5th Circuit allowed the cases to proceed.",
      "The second issue is whether federal law allows the commission to license temporary storage sites. Opponents are relying on a 2022 Supreme Court decision that held that Congress must act with specificity when it wants to give an agency the authority to regulate on an issue of major national significance. In ruling for Texas, the 5th Circuit agreed that what to do with the nation\u2019s nuclear waste is the sort of \u201cmajor question\u201d that Congress must speak to directly.",
      "But the Justice Department has argued that the commission has long-standing authority to deal with nuclear waste reaching back to the 1954 Atomic Energy Act.",

      "Vice President JD Vance says a U.S.-Ukraine critical minerals deal is a more practical deterrent against Russia than an international security force for post-war Ukraine proposed by key allies Britain and France",
      "WASHINGTON -- Vice President JD Vance is making the case that a U.S.-Ukraine critical minerals deal is a more practical deterrent against Russian President Vladimir Putin than an international security force for post-war Ukraine proposed by key allies Britain and France.",
      "Vance said in an interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity aired Monday evening that the pact that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals \u201cis a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn\u2019t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d",
      "The comments throw the spotlight again on differences between President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. The European leaders have called for a post-conflict peacekeeping force in Ukraine to prevent Russia invading again if Moscow and Kyiv reach a truce to put a stop to Russia's invasion, launched in February 2022.",
      "\u201cThe president knows that, look, if you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,\u201d Vance added.",
      "The Republican vice president did not mention any particular country in his skeptical comments to Hannity about the effectiveness of a potential peacekeeping mission. But in a posting on X on Tuesday, Vance looked to head off any criticism by noting that Britain and France \u201chave fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond.\u201d",
      "French troops deployed to Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. And British troops have served alongside American forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and in a U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group.",
      "Vance's comments came in an interview recorded hours before a White House official confirmed on Monday evening that Trump directed a pause of U.S. assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia.",
      "Trump remains frustrated with Zelenskyy. He again criticized the Ukrainian leader on Monday after Zelenskyy said that reaching an agreement with Russia to end the conflict likely \u201cis still very, very far away.\u201d",
      "Trump administration and Ukrainian officials, during Zelenskyy\u2019s White House visit last week, had been expected to sign off on a deal that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals in part to pay back the U.S. for aid it has sent Kyiv since the start of the war.",
      "But that plan was scrapped as the visit was ended abruptly after Trump and Vance had a heated exchange with Zelenskyy during Oval Office talks at the start of the visit.",
      "Ukraine is believed to have deposits of strategically important minerals \u2014 including titanium. lithium and manganese \u2014 that could be useful for American aerospace, electric vehicle and medical manufacturing.",
      "Trump hasn't given up all hope of reaching an agreement. And the White House has billed such a pact as a way to tighten U.S.-Ukrainian relations in the long term.",
      "Trump on Monday called the proposal \u201ca great deal\u201d for the U.S. and Ukraine and signaled that he would speak to it during his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress.",
      "Starmer says that \"a mineral deal is not enough on its own\u201d to ensure Ukraine's security. The British prime minister has no illusions about U.S. troops taking part in a potential peacekeeping mission.",
      "Starmer, who met with Trump last week, and others are trying to make the case to Trump that the plan can only work with a U.S. backstop for European forces on the ground \u2014 through U.S. aerial intelligence, surveillance and support, as well as rapid-response cover in case of breaches of a truce."

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday in a $10 billion lawsuit Mexico filed against top firearm manufacturers in the U.S., alleging their business practices have fueled cartel gun violence.",
      "The gun makers reject those claims. They appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that let the lawsuit move forward even though U.S. law largely shields gun makers from lawsuits.",
      "Depending on how the court rules, it could also affect a narrow legal path that helped families of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School secure a $73 million settlement from the gun maker Remington.",
      "Here's what to know about the case:",
      "Mexico has strict gun laws and has just one store where people can legally buy firearms. But thousands of guns are smuggled in by the country\u2019s powerful drug cartels.",
      "The Mexican government says 70% of those weapons come from the United States. The lawsuit claims that companies knew weapons were being sold to traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that market.",
      "The defendants include big-name manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson, Beretta, Colt and Glock. The lawsuit is still in its early stages, and if the court does side with Mexico it would still have to prove the allegations.",
      "The gun makers say there is no evidence the industry allows trafficking and they disagree with Mexico's data about how many weapons originate in the U.S. The Mexican government, not U.S. gun makers, is responsible for enforcing the laws and fighting crime, they argue.",
      "The industry is shielded from most civil lawsuits arising from crimes committed using firearms under a 20-year-old law, though Mexico has argued that it doesn't apply to crimes committed outside of the U.S.",
      "The gun companies are asking the justices to overturn an appeals court ruling that allowed the case to move forward.",
      "The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found it fell under an exception to the shield law for situations in which firearm companies are accused of knowingly violating the law.",
      "That exception has come up in other cases.",
      "The victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook argued it applied to their lawsuit because the gun maker had violated state law in the marketing of the AR-15 rifle used on the shooting, in which 20 first graders and six educators were killed.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to hear that case. After reaching the $73 million settlement, the families said they hoped it would lead to more safety and accountability.",
      "Depending on how the justices rules, their eventual findings could narrow or close that legal path.",

      "For the second year in a row, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg gave the most to charitable causes, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy\u2019s exclusive Philanthropy 50 list of the Americans who donated the largest sums to nonprofits last year.",
      "In 2024, he gave a total of $3.7 billion to support arts, education, the environment, public-health groups, and programs aimed at improving city governments. He gives directly to charities and through his Bloomberg Philanthropies, which last year awarded a $1 billion grant to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, to make medical school free and to provide financial aid to nursing and public health students.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never understood people who wait until they die to give away their wealth. Why deny yourself the satisfaction?\u201d he wrote in an email to the Chronicle. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky, and I\u2019m determined to do what I can to open doors for others and to leave a better world for my children and grandchildren.\u201d",
      "Bloomberg was one of six donors who gave $1 billion or more in 2024. The others were Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and his wife, Patty Quillin (No. 2), Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell and his wife, Susan Dell (No. 3), investor Warren Buffett (No. 4), Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, physician Priscilla Chan (No. 5), and retired professor Ruth Gottesman (No. 6).",
      "The majority of those gifts went to foundations and donor-advised funds that support causes including education, economic mobility, social justice, and scientific research. Gottesman, like Bloomberg, gave to make medical school free. She donated $1 billion to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.",
      "Together the 50 donors on the list contributed a total of $16.2 billion to charity in 2024. The median amount they gave was $100 million.",
      "While those numbers are sizable, not all of the nation\u2019s wealthiest people appear on the list. Only 19 of the richest Americans on the Forbes 400 list donated enough to appear in the Philanthropy rankings.",
      "Among those who gave big \u2014 but are less well known:",
      "\u2014 Thomas Golisano, the billionaire founder of Paychex, is No. 8. He gave away $500 million last year. Almost $400 million of that went to 123 nonprofits in New York and Florida with no strings attached. About 90 of those gifts were $1 million to $5 million, often to small groups that rarely get contributions of that size. Many were to organizations that serve people with developmental, intellectual, and physical disabilities. The issue has great meaning to Golisano, whose son has a developmental disability.",
      "\u2014 Retired insurance executive Hyatt Brown and his wife, Cici, at No. 20, gave the Museum of Arts & Sciences, in Daytona Beach, Fla., $150 million for a new building and to turn its current home into a children\u2019s museum.",
      "\u2014 Businesswoman and venture capital investor Michele Kang, at No. 28, gave $84 million last year, including $4 million to help the USA Women\u2019s Rugby Sevens team prepare for the Olympics.",
      "Some big public debates have been swirling in the world of philanthropy. Some donors \u2014 most notably hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman \u2014 pushed back against the institutions they have supported, criticizing universities\u2019 responses to the October 7 attacks in Israel and campus protests against the war in Gaza; critiquing diversity, equity, and inclusion programs; demanding changes; and pledging to halt support.",
      "Some philanthropists believe that politicized public debates about giving are unhelpful noise that can get in the way of doing effective work. K. Lisa Yang (No. 34), a retired investment banker, gave $74.5 million this year, much of that to MIT and Cornell University, where she is a trustee.",
      "Over the years, Yang has given large sums to programs that help people who are physically or cognitively disabled, and she advocates for individuals with disabilities and autism-spectrum disorders.",
      "\u201cThe people who are suffering from these disorders, they don\u2019t have the luxury of time,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you have a rare disease and they do politics, to the people who are suffering from the disorder, it is totally irrelevant. They\u2019re still suffering.\u201d",
      "But some donors are loath to get ensnared in high-profile polarizing issues, says Renee Kaplan, CEO of the donor advisory firm Forward Global. As a result, she says, some donors are staying out of the fray by making anonymous gifts. Others are working together in donor collaboratives, both to boost their power and resources and to shield individual contributors from criticism.",
      "Donors are starting to say, \u201cI\u2019ll do more anonymously. I\u2019m not going to put my name on things. I\u2019m going to slow down our foundation for a while because I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be a target,\u201d Kaplan says. \u201cI think there\u2019s genuine concern and pause and fear that\u2019s affecting donors.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s list marks the 25th anniversary of the Philanthropy 50 ranking. Buffett was the top donor over that period, with cumulative gifts totaling $49.4 billion. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates followed, with the $34 billion they gave together. (Since their divorce, both have appeared on the list individually.) Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk round out the top five.",
      "Buffett, Gates and French Gates, and Bloomberg together account for roughly one-third of the $314.5 billion in giving by Philanthropy 50 donors since 2000. The biggest gift made during that time is Buffett\u2019s 2006 pledge to the Gates Foundation, valued at the time at $36.1 billion.",

      "It was a punishment for mutiny in colonial times, a way to discourage desertion during the Civil War and a dose of frontier justice in the Old West. In modern times, some consider it a more humane alternative to lethal injection. The firing squad has a long and thorny history in the U.S.",
      "South Carolina on Friday is scheduled to put the first person to death by firing squad in the U.S. in 15 years. Brad Sigmon, who was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's parents in 2001, chose it over the two other methods in South Carolina \u2014 the electric chair and lethal injection.",
      "Since 1608, at least 144 civilian prisoners have been executed by shooting in America, nearly all in Utah. Only three have occurred since 1977, when the use of capital punishment resumed after a 10-year pause. The first of those, Gary Gilmore, caused a media sensation in part because he waived his appeals and volunteered to be executed. When asked for his last words, Gilmore replied, \u201cLet's do it.\u201d",
      "Five states \u2014 Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah \u2014 authorize the use of firing squads in certain circumstances.",
      "Here's a look at the history behind the death penalty method.",
      "The earliest recorded execution by shooting came in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1608. Capt. George Kendall came to be suspected of mutiny \u2014 and possibly of conspiring with Spain. Centuries later, in 1996, archaeologists discovered a bullet-ridden body buried in the fort's walls that many suspect was Kendall.",
      "In the American Revolution, public executions by firing squad were sometimes used to punish desertion.",
      "In 1776, then-Gen. George Washington spared a Connecticut soldier, Ebenezer Leffingwell, who was sentenced to die after fighting with a superior, the Journal of the American Revolution recounted. Leffingwell had been bound, blindfolded and forced to kneel in front of a crowd when a chaplain involved in the proceedings announced he would live.",
      "Mark Smith, a history professor at the University of South Carolina, said firing squads were used \u2014 not often \u2014 by both sides during the Civil War to create a \u201cpublic spectacle, a vision of terror\u201d to keep soldiers in line.",
      "\u201cA man could be sitting on his own coffin at times or blindfolded, shot by six or seven men, one of whom has a blank,\u201d the professor said. \u201cThese were gatherings designed to shock and it worked.\u201d",
      "At least 185 men were executed by firing squad during the Civil War, according to Christopher Q. Cutler in a Cleveland State Law Review article.",
      "Firing squads were primarily used only in Utah, where the lawmakers in 1851 designated three possible punishments for murder: shooting, hanging or beheading. The first firing squad execution was carried out in a courthouse enclosure, disappointing a crowd waiting outside to see it.",
      "Only one other state since 1900 has executed someone by shooting: Nevada, which in 1913 built a contraption that fired three guns by pulling strings because it had trouble finding volunteers to serve on a firing squad.",
      "An 1877 sentencing in Utah gave rise to the first U.S. Supreme Court case challenging a specific execution method. Wallace Wilkerson, who shot a man to death during a heated game of cribbage, challenged authorities' plans to kill him by firing squad. The court declined his appeal, finding that unlike some other bygone methods \u2014 drawing and quartering, for example \u2014 execution by firing squad would not bring the sort of \u201cterror, pain and disgrace\u201d that would violate the 8th Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "As it turned out, Wilkerson's killing was botched, Cutler noted: Reportedly intoxicated and smoking a cigar, he moved slightly just before the executioners shot. Badly wounded, he fell to the ground, saying, \"My God! They\u2019ve missed it.\u201d It took him an agonizing 15 minutes to die.",
      "Among other famous firing squad executions in Utah was the 1915 death of labor activist and songwriter Joe Hill, who until the end insisted on his innocence in the murder of a grocer and his son.",
      "One of the reasons firing squads did not gain much use beyond Utah was that people viewed them as barbaric, according to Deborah Denno, a criminologist at Fordham School of Law.",
      "The bloody reality of those killings, as well as botched hangings and electrocutions, which sometimes led people to struggle and suffer, prompted states in the early 1980s to begin turning to lethal injection, a procedure viewed \u2014 at least initially \u2014 as more humane.",
      "But since then, lethal injection has become the most commonly botched execution method, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. States have struggled to obtain the required drugs, and some have taken another look at firing squads \u2014 an old but largely reliable method. Lawmakers in Idaho are considering a bill that would make firing squads the primary method of execution there.",
      "Two people now on Utah\u2019s death row have requested firing squads.",
      "Denno urged policymakers to reconsider firing squads in a 2016 law review article. Among those who have expressed similar views is Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote in a 2017 dissent that \u201cin addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless.\u201d",
      "\u201cLethal injection has only gotten worse over the decades,\u201d Denno told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cThe firing squad really stands out as a relatively decent method of execution.\u201d",
      "In the annals of executions in the U.S., she said, there have been just two botched firing squad executions: Wilkerson's and that of Eliseo Mares in Utah in 1951. It's not clear what happened in Mares' case, but reports surfaced decades later that the executioners disliked him and intentionally missed his heart to prolong his suffering.",
      "With greater oversight and expert shooters, those problems wouldn't be repeated today, Denno said.",
      "In South Carolina, Sigmon, 67, chose to die by firing squad because the alternatives seemed worse, his attorney Gerald \u201cBo\u201d King wrote in a statement.",
      "Some aspects of his execution are modern \u2014 for example, bullets are deadlier and guns are now more precise.",
      "But much of it would have been familiar in Utah more than a century ago: A hooded inmate with a target over his heart is bound to a chair in a death chamber and may say his final words. Nearby, volunteer officers await the order to fire.",

      "Mayors from Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York are set to testify in Congress as Republicans take aim at \u201csanctuary cities\u201d policies",
      "Associated Press -- Mayors from four major cities are set to testify Wednesday in Congress as Republicans take aim at \u201csanctuary cities,\" arguing that they impede the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda and protect people who are in the United States illegally.",
      "Mayors Michelle Wu of Boston, Brandon Johnson of Chicago, Mike Johnston of Denver and Eric Adams of New York will appear before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.",
      "In an indication of what's likely to come, the Republican majority last week released a nearly three-minute-long video previewing the hearing. It opens with images of the Constitution catching fire and burning, revealing photos of the four mayors. It goes on to show arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents of people who'd committed crimes in those cities interspersed with comments from the mayors and news stories showing negative impacts of migration surges.",
      "The video ends with the committee chair, Rep. James Comer of Kentusky, threatening to cut the cities' federal funding if they don't cooperate with immigration enforcement.",
      "There\u2019s no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with ICE. The agency enforces U.S. immigration laws nationwide but often seeks state and local help to hold people who've been arrested or convicted of a crime until federal officers can take custody.",
      "In communities that don't cooperate, ICE agents go into communities to track down people after their release. ICE argues that this is dangerous and strains resources.",
      "Trump administration officials have also argued that if communities work with them on immigration enforcement, \u201ccollateral arrests\" \u2014 when ICE detains people other than those targeted \u2014 are less likely.",
      "\u201cSanctuary cities want to keep locking us out of jails,\" President Donald Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, told reporters. \u201cThey force us into the neighborhood to find the bad guys. When we find the bad guy, many times they\u2019re with others.\u201d",
      "But some cities and states say cooperating with ICE means victims and witnesses who are in the U.S. illegally won\u2019t come forward. And, to varying degrees, officials argue that they want their localities to be welcoming places for immigrants.",
      "Advocates say that while ICE claims to target \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d \u2014 meaning immigrants who've committed heinous crimes in the U.S. \u2014 they end up going far beyond that, destabilizing communities.",
      "Courts have repeatedly upheld the legality of most sanctuary laws.",
      "But the Trump administration continues to target them and has sued Chicago and Illinois as well as New York state over various immigration laws."

We apologize for any disruption that this may have caused,\u201d it said.",

      "It\u2019s not clear how many of them returned to work Wednesday. And it's also unclear whether the employees would be spared from further widespread job cuts that are expected soon across government agencies.",
      "The CDC is the latest federal agency trying to coax back workers soon after they were dismissed as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s and billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s cost-cutting purge. Similar reversals have been made among employees responsible for medical device oversight, food safety, bird flu response, nuclear weapons and national parks.",
      "The Atlanta-based CDC is charged with protecting Americans from outbreaks and other public health threats. Before the job cuts, the agency had about 13,000 employees.",
      "Last month, Trump administration officials told the CDC that nearly 1,300 of the agency's probationary employees would be let go. That tally quickly changed, as the number who actually got termination notices turned out to be 700 to 750.",
      "With 180 more people now being told they can return, the actual number of CDC employees terminated so far would seem to stand somewhere around 550. But federal health officials haven't confirmed any specifics.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last month pledged \u201c radical transparency \u201d at the department, but HHS officials have not provided detail about CDC staff changes and did not respond to emailed requests on Tuesday and Wednesday. An agency spokesman, Andrew Nixon, previously told the AP only that CDC had more full-time employees after the job cuts than it did before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Those who received reinstatement emails included outbreak responders in two fellowship programs \u2014 a two-year training that prepares recent graduates to enter the public health workforce through field experience and a laboratory program that brings in doctorate-holding professionals.",
      "U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock celebrated the reinstatements, but said it's not enough.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has paused its intelligence sharing with Ukraine, cutting off the flow of vital information that has helped the war-torn nation target Russian invaders, but Trump administration officials said Wednesday that positive talks between Washington and Kyiv mean it may only be a short suspension.",
      "Information about Russia's intentions and military movements has been critical to Ukraine's defense and a strong indication of support from the U.S. and other Western allies. The suspension comes after Trump paused military aid to Ukraine and is another sign of how he has transformed America's relationship with close allies.",
      "\u201cWe have taken a step back and are pausing and reviewing all aspects of this relationship,\u201d national security adviser Mike Waltz said Wednesday.",

      "The moves by the new administration have dismayed leaders in Europe and Democrats in Washington, who say Trump is depriving a key American ally of assistance they need to fight Russia.",

      "\u201cThere are going to be tariffs, let\u2019s be clear,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cBut what he\u2019s thinking about is which sections of the market that can maybe \u2014 maybe \u2014 he\u2019ll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2.\u201d",
      "On April 2, Trump plans to announce what he calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs to match the tariffs, taxes and subsidies from other countries. That could dramatically increase the tariff rates charged globally while maintaining the risk of broader tariffs.",
      "If the tariffs are not removed, Ontario Premier Doug Ford told AP, the American and Canadian auto industries will last approximately 10 days before they start shutting down assembly lines in the U.S. and Ontario.",

      "Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, noted that Trudeau called the tariffs \u201cvery dumb\u201d at a news conference Tuesday and said Trudeau\u2019s tough talk resonated well with Canadians.",
      "\u201cCanada had a choice: to go along with Lutnick\u2019s proposal or to reject it. The government opted for the latter, but that may be a negotiating ploy. It is playing well with Canadians. They are very angry with Trump,\u201d Wiseman said.",

      "A mysterious affliction that causes prehistoric, endangered smalltooth sawfish to spin erratically in Florida waters and often die appears to have resurfaced, with more than 50 deaths last year",
      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- A mysterious affliction that causes prehistoric, endangered smalltooth sawfish to spin erratically in Florida waters and often die appears to have resurfaced, with more than 50 deaths recorded last year, wildlife officials said Wednesday.",
      "Following a roughly nine-month lull, there have been 22 reports of the odd spinning behavior involving sawfish in waters around the Florida Keys since December, the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported. Six sawfish deaths were reported in this recent outbreak.",
      "It's unclear what is causing the problem that led to at least 54 sawfish deaths last year. The agency reported that testing for parasites, bacteria, viruses and more than 250 chemicals, as well as checks for such issues as toxic red tide, turned up nothing definitive.",
      "\u201cScientists did find some subtle changes in the brain tissue of affected fish, but more research is needed,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Sawfish, related to rays, skates and sharks, are named for their elongated, flat snout that contains a row of teeth on each side. Sawfish have been around for millions of years, can live for decades and grow quite large, with some as long as 17 feet (about 5 meters). They were once abundant off the coast of the southeastern U.S. but now are mainly located off the coast of southwestern Florida and the Keys island chain, as their habitats shrink.",
      "Since December 2023, more than 500 reports of spinning sawfish and other species have been documented.",
      "After the initial deaths, state legislators approved $2 million to fund the investigation into sawfish deaths in Biscayne Bay near Miami, Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. Some of the money goes to local fishing guides for water sampling and other work, according to FWC. There is also a sawfish hotline for people to report spinning or whirling fish.",
      "One theory is that a lengthy heat wave last year largely attributed to climate change and blamed for bleaching corals may have changed the algae in ocean waters, especially near the sea floor, where sawfish are often found. Like rays, sawfish gills are on their undersides, so their intake is frequently from the bottom.",
      "\u201cScientists have found a number of algal toxins in fish tissues, and these are currently being investigated as potential causes,\u201d the FWC said.",
      "The smalltooth sawfish has been on the U.S. endangered species list since 2003. Florida prohibits intentionally capturing, harming or harassing sawfish.",
      "In recent years, threatened manatees also suffered a major die-off in Florida waters as pollution killed much of their seagrass food source. State and federal officials fed tons of lettuce to manatees that gathered in winter outside a power plant for two years, and the manatee numbers have rebounded somewhat, with 565 deaths recorded in 2024 compared to a record 1,100 in 2021."

      "But tariffs could affect the UK economy in a number of ways, she said.",
      "If there are tariffs imposed on UK goods going into the US, this would \"put downward pressure\" on the UK economy, because firms would find it harder to sell to US consumers.",
      "But that could also lower inflation, the pace at which prices rise.",
      "If supply chains fragmented and had to be reordered this would hit UK growth and push up inflation.",
      "\"Ultimately, tariffs would push down on growth\", Greene said, adding that there was a \"tonne of uncertainty\" about how Trump's tariffs would play out, but there would probably be more negatives for UK the economic activity than positives.",
      "Professor Alan Taylor, who is also a monetary policy committee member, agreed  the risks to the economy outweigh the upsides, and that \"is true for people around the country and around the world\".",
      "He added: \"If you put sand in those wheels [of trade] we're going to be worse off on some margin.\"",

      "Trump's tariffs risk economic turbulence - and voter backlash",
      "Trump mulls exemption for some carmakers from tariffs",
      "Bailey called for trade disputes to be settled via the World Trade Organization, rather than thrashed out between the US and other countries.",
      "Mr Trump and his administration have said higher tariffs on goods imported into the US will help it get better deals with allies and rivals around the world.",
      "But experts have warned that trade barriers could hurt the US, triggering higher prices and more inflation, as well as hitting economies around the world.",
      "Separately, Bailey also warned of risks should the US leave institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which lend to countries to try to avert financial crises.",
      "Some of Trump's allies, including key White House staff, have previously recommended withdrawing.",
      "Bailey said the move would be a \"very damaging thing for the world\".",

      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",

      "However, history tells us that those firing the opening shots in a trade war also  suffer heavy casualties. Despite the president's rhetoric, American consumers are  on the front line.",

      "Vegetables from Mexico, wheat from Canada, toys and T-shirts from China are all in the firing line. Retailers of such items can have very narrow profit margins and will raise prices quickly to cover the tariffs.",

      "Then consider the impact on American manufacturers who have businesses spanning Canada, Mexico and perhaps even China. Overall, economists think we could be looking at a hit to US growth of up to 1% - not enough to prompt a recession, but unwelcome nonetheless.",
      "In sheer numbers terms, the hit to the Canadian economy could be greater, economists say. It sells more than $400bn worth of goods to America every year, accounting for a fifth of its income.",
      "But it has the capacity to lower interest rates, and healthy public finances, providing policy makers with scope to cushion the blow for Canadians.",
      "The damage to Mexico's national income could be less severe, but its central bank has less capacity to cut interest rates making it harder to deflect the pain.",
      "All of this will be anxiously watched by the European Union, likely next in line for those Trump tariffs. Germany, already in a fragile state, accounts for about a third of the goods sold by the EU to the US.",
      "China, despite being the target of Trump's repeated trade blows could actually be less vulnerable. Its exports to the US account for less than 3% of national income - easily made up elsewhere.",
      "Ironically, some of this resilience is down to the tariffs imposed by President Trump last time round. China simply looked for new markets.",
      "Countries like the UK could also benefit from a furthering of such trade diversion, more access to cheaper goods -  something that could  keep our own inflation down.",
      "A key point about trade wars is that there are winners as well as losers - particularly for those countries outside President Trump's firing line. Vietnam and Malaysia for example saw their exports grow rapidly during President Trump's last term as they scrambled to replace China in selling to America.",
      "If the UK continues to escape the wrath of President Trump, we could actually benefit from closer trading links with his country and indeed from greater foreign investment, if we looked to be a more certain environment than some of our competitors. But of course, our fate remains unclear.",
      "As it stands, the prospects for global growth in 2025 have dulled, but a recession appears very unlikely. However, in Trump world we have learnt very quickly to expect the unexpected - so much still depends on what happens from here.",
      "And that uncertainty itself is harming business confidence both in the US and around the world, putting off key decisions about where to invest and create jobs.",
      "Weaponising uncertainty too comes at a price - even on home soil."

      "In February, US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on products made in China by 10%. Then last week, with little warning, he announced an additional 10% border tax, which has now come into force on Tuesday, along with tariffs on Mexico and Canada.",
      "In the toy industry, which estimates that about 80% of toys sold in the US are made in China, the rapid-fire announcements have stunned businesses, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to swallow a sudden 20% rise in cost.",
      "The moves are the first of what Trump has threatened will be far wider action, making it a preview of the upheaval that could be coming for companies around the world.",
      "\"It's the first thing we talk about and the last thing we talk about,\" toymaker Jay Foreman said this weekend from his booth at the trade show, where classic hits such as Lincoln Logs, Tonka Trucks and K'Nex were on display.",
      "His business, Basic Fun!, makes 90% of its products in China and had been planning to counter the cost of the initial 10% tariff with a mix of higher prices for customers and lower profits, both for his firm and for his manufacturing partners.",

      "And they fall short of the \"up to 60%\" tariff that Trump called for on the campaign trail last year.",
      "But with the latest move, businesses say the costs are getting too big to ignore.",
      "The average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, with recent actions amounting to a rise roughly twice as large as the increase during Trump's first four-year term as president, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.",
      "\"10% - it's something we can somehow live with. 20% is a different ball game,\" said Yaron Barlev, chief operating officer of Clixo, a Brooklyn-based maker of magnetic building toys which started about five years ago and signed a deal last year to start selling its toys at Target later in 2025.",
      "With manufacturing in China now under way to satisfy that order, his firm, which employs 18 people in the US, is expecting to have to shoulder the costs of the border duties, scrambling its plans for profits.",
      "He said he hoped Trump would offer some kind of reprieve for toys but was not feeling especially optimistic.",
      "\"It's much less predictable now than he used to be so I really don't know.\"",
      "Trump has said his actions will help boost manufacturing in the US, by making it less cost-effective to make products overseas.",
      "But toymakers like Clixo, which had hoped to do its manufacturing in the US, say high costs and limited manufacturing capacity in the US make that idea unrealistic.",
      "Meanwhile, a string of weaker economic data has raised concerns that the uncertainty due to the tariff talk is starting to cause wider economic paralysis.",
      "Basic Fun!, which employs about 165 people and does roughly $200m in sales each year, had been looking to grow. But with the threat of tariffs bearing down, Mr Foreman recently put plans for acquisitions on hold, unsure how to calculate what a business would be worth in such a changeable environment.",
      "\"[A tariff] sounds good - 'Let's stick it to them!' But the ripple effect is unbelievable,\" Mr Foreman said.",
      "The Toy Association, a business lobby group, says it is trying to make the case to the White House and Congress that toys should be exempt from tariffs, as they were before, warning that higher prices won't go unnoticed by a public already upset by the jump in prices in recent years.",
      "President Greg Ahearn said his members are largely small businesses with profit margins barely as large as the tariffs that are getting under way.",
      "\"We think we have a very strong point to make and we're hoping they're going to be open to listening,\" he said.",

      "\"It's killing our mojo,\" said Mr Ahearn, noting that it was his members' top concern.",
      "From their booths, toymakers greeted questions about Trump's moves with head shakes, grimaces and disbelief.",
      "\"20% is a lot,\" said Ada Luo, sales director for Wonderful Party, a manufacturer in Shenzhen, China, which makes Christmas light necklaces, leis and New Year's hats. \"10% maybe... between the supplier and the buyer we can share, but 20%? We don't have a clue.\""

      "More than one million low-paid workers in the UK are to be entitled to 80% of their weekly salary as sick pay from the first day of illness, under government plans.",
      "Currently, to qualify for statutory sick pay, you must have been ill for more than three days in a row and earn an average of at least \u00a3123 a week.",
      "\"No one should ever have to choose between their health and earning a living, which is why we are making this landmark change,\" said Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce called the 80% rate a \"fair compromise\", but warned allowing sick pay from day one could lead to higher staff absenteeism that smaller firms could struggle to cope with.",
      "\"Employers often struggle to find shift cover at short notice, leading to disruption for customers,\" said Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the BCC.",
      "\"The government's impact assessment did not produce compelling evidence on the day-one rights issue, so there may yet be unforeseen consequences.\"",
      "The government says the changes will mean about 1.3 million people on low wages who fall ill will receive either 80% of their average weekly earnings or statutory sick pay - which is currently \u00a3116.75 per week \u2013 whichever is lowest.",
      "\"The new rate is good for workers and fair on businesses as part our plan to boost rights and make work pay, while delivering our plan for change,\" Kendall said.",
      "However, some groups are asking the government to set sick pay for the lowest paid workers at no less than 95% of their weekly pay.",
      "TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: \"This shouldn't be the end of the story.",
      "\"We urge ministers in future to raise the replacement rate for the lowest earners beyond 80% and undertake a wider review of the statutory sick pay rate.\"",
      "How will the changes to workers' rights  affect you?",
      "More workers to get sick pay and parental leave rights",
      "The change to sick pay is part of a number of updates to the Employment Rights Bill expected to be announced on Tuesday, and aims to keep more people off benefits and boost living standards.",
      "The bill, which was published last year, set out plans to improve sick pay and allow workers greater rights to ask for flexible working and unpaid parental leave.",
      "However, the planned increase in workers' rights, together with the rising minimum wage and hike in employers' National Insurance, has led to criticism from many businesses, who say the combined impact will hit growth and employment.",
      "At the weekend it emerged that the government would not be including the \"right to switch off\" for workers in the bill.",
      "This measure had been proposed to stop employers contacting staff out-of-hours on phones, emails and texts.",
      "A government source told the Sunday Times that: \"The right to switch off is dead. We have to lower business compliance costs as much as possible.\""

      "In January 2025, Business and Trade Committee had argued the Post Office should not decide on what was owed to victims of its own scandal.",
      "It is another step in the long-running Post Office scandal. Under the previous Conservative government, a new law was passed to overturn the convictions of more than 900 people.",
      "More than 4,000 people in total have been told they are eligible for compensation. But the schemes they need to access in order to receive remuneration for their suffering can be long-winded and complicated.",
      "We've broken down how they work.",
      "What are the main compensation schemes?",
      "There isn't a single compensation scheme for sub-postmasters to apply to, and individual eligibility will depend on the particular circumstances of an individual's case.",
      "The four main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. They are explained in more detail in the following sections.",
      "Which scheme is available to Alan Bates and others depicted in the ITV drama?",
      "Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama.",
      "While the cohort secured a \u00a342.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation pay-out at the end of it.",
      "The Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme was set up to ensure they received extra money to reflect the gravity of their situations. The scheme is funded and managed by the government.",
      "As of January 2024, people eligible for this scheme \"will receive at least \u00a375,000 in compensation upfront\".",
      "The government estimates around two thirds will turn that offer down and push for more. In those cases, the government will award postmasters 80% of the initial offer made to them.",
      "On 9 September, Labour said it will set a target of making an offer to 90% of sub-postmasters who have submitted a full claim within 40 days.",
      "As of 31 January, \u00a3128m has been paid under the scheme, including interim payments.",
      "Of the 555 members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are overturned.",
      "If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "ITV's drama Alan Bates vs The Post Office has introduced millions to the long-running scandal",
      "What compensation is there for people with overturned convictions?",
      "There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.",
      "People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office.",
      "A total of 111 people have had their convictions overturned as of 31 January. But when the government's promised law to overturn all convictions linked to the scandal becomes a reality, hundreds more people will be eligible.",
      "Those whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked \u00a3600,000 settlement. Or they can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more.",
      "All eligible people are entitled to an \"interim\" payment while their final settlements are processed. The government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments.",
      "For those people whose conviction is overturned through the new law, they can register for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "This will entitle them to an initial \u00a3200,000 interim payment. They can then decide to accept \u00a3600,000 or have their case fully reviewed.",
      "As of 31 January, external, \u00a365m has been paid out under this scheme including further interim payments.",
      "The latest figures show that out of 111 eligible claimants in the OCS scheme, 82 claims for full and final settlements have been made with 66 paid out.",
      "A further seven have received offers. The remaining nine are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd.",

      "Fearing prosecution, some sub-postmasters poured their own savings into their businesses to make up losses that were incorrectly calculated by the computer programme.",
      "In September, the Labour government announced a new independent appeals process system called the Horizon Shortfall Scheme intended for those sub-postmasters who weren't convicted or part of the GLO court action.",
      "It means they can appeal if they feel their financial settlement did not reflect the true extent of their losses and trauma.",
      "It is administered by the Post Office but the independent appeals process will be overseen by the Department for Business. Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said he was still considering whether to transfer this scheme to the government as well.",
      "It has received more than 4,665 eligible claims so far, according to data, external from the Department for Business and Trade.",
      "Around \u00a3315m has been paid to 2,090 of these claims as of the end of January 2025.",
      "How many people are eligible for compensation overall?",
      "The number of people eligible for one of the three main schemes stands at over 4,000 - and the government has said new potential victims are still coming forward.",
      "It is unclear how many of them will end up receiving payments, and the processes - which have been criticised by campaigners for being too slow - can sometimes take several years.",
      "What about people who died before receiving compensation?",
      "On 10 January 2024, the then Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake told the Commons the families of the 60 people who died before receiving any compensation would be able to apply for it in their place.",

      "Kasia said she would like more control over her service charges but the government's commonhold proposals were for new builds, so would not help her in her current situation.",
      "Jean Hopkin, another leaseholder who got in touch with the BBC, said the service charge for her three-bedroom flat in Sheffield had increased 356% - from \u00a3106 a month to \u00a3483 in four years - and was unsellable because of the high charges.",

      "John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, said it would look at  whether TikTok's data collection practices could lead to children experiencing harms, such as data being leaked or spending \"more time than is healthy\" on the platform.",
      "TikTok told the BBC its recommender systems operated under \"strict and comprehensive measures that protect the privacy and safety of teens\".",
      "It added that the platform also has \"robust restrictions on the content allowed in teens' feeds\".",

      "In addition to the probe into TikTok, the ICO is also checking the age verification processes of Reddit and Imgur, an image-sharing platform.",
      "The investigation will look into whether the companies are complying with both the UK's data protection laws, and the children's code.",
      "The code is set to design principles for online platforms aimed at protecting children in the UK.  Platforms which collect UK children's user data must minimise the amount they gather and take extra care when processing it.",
      "Reddit and Imgur probes",
      "The ICO's investigations into Reddit and Imgur will focus on how the platforms check the ages of their users and their enforcement of age checks.",
      "Ofcom said in October Reddit had overtaken X as the UK's fifth most popular platform.",
      "Imgur, meanwhile, says on its website that it reaches more than 250 million people a month.   However, it does not state in which countries their users are based, so there is no figure for the number of people using it in the UK.",
      "\"I don't want to pre-judge how we might look at the Imgur and Reddit matters, but if there are age limits for accessing services, then the platforms have to enforce those in some ways,\" the Information Commissioner told the BBC.",
      "\"There are a number of different technologies and techniques that are available, I would say, and the degree of rigor, I think, depends in part upon the kinds of risks, the likelihood that children will be accessing those sites.",
      "\"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\"",
      "A Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\".",
      "Imgur has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.",
      "Next steps",
      "The investigations do not necessarily mean any of the three platforms have broken the law.",
      "But companies which are found to have done so can be punished with enforcement notices and fines.",
      "\"We are patrolling, and there will be consequences for breaches of the law,\" said Mr Edwards.",
      "It is not the first time TikTok has faced scrutiny from the ICO.  The platform is appealing against an ICO fine of \u00a312.7m in 2023 for misusing children's data issued in 2023."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:25:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Protests, politicking and planning could stall the runway, despite the government being 'minded to approve' it",
    "story": [
      "Expansion at Gatwick Airport has moved a step closer after the government gave the plan its tentative backing.",
      "On the surface Gatwick's plans look relatively straightforward.",
      "In contrast to Heathrow, which wants to bulldoze houses and reroute the M25, Gatwick is proposing to shift an already existing runway just 12 metres north, and bring it into regular use.",
      "Yet it still may not happen for years, or may not happen at all.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Gatwick officially opened as an airport in 1958. It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.",
      "It was never supposed to be for daily use.",
      "In fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years.",
      "Now, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.",
      "In the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.",
      "However, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.",
      "The back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.",
      "How long would expansion take?",
      "Just because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.",
      "There is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution.",
      "Climate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.",
      "And in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.",
      "Then there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.",
      "Even if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.",
      "\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.",
      "Will it actually happen?",
      "Gatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.",
      "But there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.",
      "By 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.",
      "It will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.",
      "Politicians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.",
      "While there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.",
      "Richard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.",
      "In the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.",

    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:03:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Switzerland's already upmarket tourism sector is trying to attract more high rollers.",
    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",

      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",
      "It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries.",
      "Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.",
      "Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",
      "Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.",

      "Critical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.",
      "Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.",
      "In December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.",
      "How would a deal help Kyiv exploit its minerals?",
      "Some commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.",
      "According to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",
      "Developing these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine.",
      "She argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.",
      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"",
      "Trump has also suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee to deter Russian aggression in the future, but Ukraine and European leaders have insisted that would not be enough."

    "story": [
      "Academics from leading universities have condemned the decision to pull a scheme teaching Latin in the state sector.",
      "The \u00a34m, four-year project was introduced by the Conservative government in 2022, but that was ditched by Labour in February with immediate effect.",
      "Critics of the programme said its success was limited, but some academics and MPs have described it as a \"tragedy\" for young people from less privileged backgrounds.",
      "The government said it inherited a deficit which meant \"tough decisions were needed\", but Latin GCSE pupils sitting exams in summer would get support.",
      "There are some state schools that still offer pupils the chance to learn a language some describe as dead.",
      "At Keswick School in Cumbria, the subject is studied after hours as an extra option.",
      "For the last ten years it has been taught to GCSE level by Marcella Jackson who said it is not just for the academic elite.",
      "\"We offer Latin to pupil premium students, to children from different sets, abilities and backgrounds,\" Ms Jackson said.",
      "\"They all like languages, they like history and it's nice to give them an opportunity they wouldn't get anywhere else.\"",
      "Some of her former GCSE students say they have benefited from their insight into the ancient language.",
      "Marianne, who is now in the sixth form, said: \"I want to become a vet and in medicine it's a kind of universal language for all sorts of things, so it's really useful.\"",
      "Classmate Richard said: \"I really enjoyed learning where the words have come that we use in modern English, and so many European languages are all derived from Latin.\"",
      "Durham Johnston School is another that offers the language to GCSE level, but as part of the main school day.",
      "When I visited they had a Latin VIP in their lesson.",
      "Prof Arlene Holmes-Henderson leads a department at Durham University dedicated to promoting the study of Latin and the Classics.",
      "She had a stark statistic to pass on to the Latin learners: \"In the state sector, you have four times more chance of being able to study a classical subject in London and the South East than you do in the North East.\"",
      "She said that means many pupils studying in the shadow of Hadrian's Wall are missing out on the benefits of Latin.",
      "'Unlock literacy'",
      "During a seven-year research project, Prof Holmes-Henderson discovered Latin study made the most difference to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.",
      "She found there were \"three groups of pupils who benefited most - young people with special educational needs and disabilities, students who speak English as an additional language and those who qualify for free school meals\".",
      "\"All three groups, who face barriers to their learning, unlocked significant benefits in English literacy.\"",
      "Durham Johnston School's Latin teacher Cathy Bothwell said helping the disadvantaged is the reason the school has persevered with the subject.",
      "She said: \"Despite the cost of offering the subject, it is that social justice aspect.",
      "\"We have a very varied demographic and providing everyone with access to demanding academic subjects like Latin is a key part of that.\"",
      "There is another divide too.",
      "A British Society study in 2020 found that while only 3% of state schools offered Latin, that figure rose to 49% in the fee-paying sector.",
      "Only two of the region's schools - Polam Hall in Darlington, and Queen Elizabeth Grammar in Hexham - had taken advantage of the 2022 government Latin programme, but one of a group of MPs working to promote the study of the classics is determined the current government does not give up on Latin in state schools.",
      "York Central's Rachael Maskell, who is a Labour member of the All Party Parliamentary Classics Group, said it would be a tragedy if the subject does end up purely in the private sector.",
      "She said: \"Giving young people from less privileged backgrounds access is really important.",
      "\"We cannot have the whole classics agenda being in the hands of the few, so let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater and [instead] ensure there is something there for the benefit of classical education across the UK.\"",
      "'Latin is for everyone'",
      "A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"The \u00a322bn black hole we inherited means tough decisions are needed across the public sector.\"",
      "The department said it had \"worked with Classics for All and the Classical Association so teachers at the 39 schools on the Latin Excellence Programme can continue to benefit from high quality teacher training, and so that the small number of pupils in those schools who are due to sit their Latin GCSE this summer get the support they need\"\"",
      "Prof Holme-Henderson's message was \"nil desperandum\" - do not despair.",
      "She said there were alternative sources of funding for a subject that is still part of the national curriculum and the region can still be at the heart of Latin's revival.",
      "\"Durham University has the only research centre in the world dedicated to classics education research, engaging multiple stakeholders on how we can widen access to the teaching of the subject in our schools and communities.",
      "\"We are pioneers in this region and we want to share the message with as many people as possible that Latin is for everyone and there is funding available to make that happen.\"",

      "However, an estimated one in 10 eligible children miss out on the meals, according to experts who gave evidence to MPs scrutinising the bill.",
      "Kate Antsey, of the Child Poverty Action Group, told MPs that it was often because of language barriers or difficulty with the administrative process experienced by their parents.",
      "Another estimate published in April 2024 by the think tank Policy in Practice put the number of children needlessly missing out on free school meals at 471,000.",
      "The cross-party education committee said the government should change the current rules using the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill - which is currently making its way through Parliament - to remove the need for manual enrolment.",
      "Failing to address the issue would be a \"missed opportunity\" to feed hungry children at school, the report concluded.",
      "It added that low uptake of free school meals contributes to hunger at school for children living with deprivation.",
      "The MPs also accused the government of rushing the bill through the House of Commons \"at the expense of time for proper scrutiny\".",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has called it a \"landmark\" bill to \"seek to keep children safe\".",
      "It includes plans for all children to have a unique identifier number, a bit like a National Insurance number, for safeguarding purposes.",
      "It also includes other wide-ranging proposals, such as universal free breakfast clubs in all primary schools, and changes to academy schools' powers.",
      "Some of its proposals - particularly around academies - have been criticised, including by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who called it educational \"vandalism\".",
      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary at school leaders' union NAHT, agreed with the committee's calls for auto-enrolment for free school meals, adding: \"Too often social stigma means parents do not register.",
      "\"Crucially, enrolment for free school meals also unlocks pupil premium money for pupils, so without registration they also miss out on this vital additional support.\"",
      "Campaigners say automatic enrolment would also bring in millions in extra funding for schools via pupil premium grants.",
      "The government pays schools \u00a31,455 per primary pupil on free school meals or \u00a31,035 per secondary pupil, per year, for at least six years.",
      "Other recommendations in the report include ensuring that children with special educational needs and disabilities can access universal free breakfast clubs, strengthening the access of children in care to mental health support, and developing a national care offer.",
      "Education committee chairwoman Helen Hayes said: \"The committee has made recommendations designed to strengthen support for the most vulnerable children in society, based on compelling evidence from experts and from young people who shared with us their deeply moving experiences of life in care.\"",
      "The committee called on the government to develop a consistent national offer for care leavers across the country, to support vulnerable young people with things like transport costs and access to apprenticeships.",
      "The DfE said the \"landmark\" schools bill would break the \"unfair link between background and opportunity\".",
      "\"Despite the challenging inherited fiscal context, we are introducing landmark measures to support family finances, including rolling out free breakfast clubs in every primary school and capping the number of branded uniform items parents have to pay for, as well as prioritising reform across children's social care.\"",

      "Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has written off \u00a31m-worth of people's debts, using \u00a3100,000 of his own money.",
      "Sheen started a debt acquisition company to help 900 people in south Wales.",
      "It has been documented in a new Channel 4 show called Michael Sheen's Secret Million Pound Giveaway, due to air next week - five months after the closure of Port Talbot's last blast furnace, which marked the end of traditional steelmaking in south Wales.",
      "The show aims to reveal how some banks and finance companies profit from society's most vulnerable.",
      "Sheen said he did not have \u00a3100,000 to \"throw around\" and therefore wanted the project to be \"effective\".",
      "Despite initial doubts, an encounter with a woman in a Port Talbot cafe who shared the story of \"steelworkers in tears\" losing their jobs, convinced him to keep going.",
      "Sheen to fund new national theatre for Wales",

      "It comes two months after Sheen announced he was funding a new theatre company to fill the gap left by the folding of National Theatre Wales.",
      "In 2021, Sheen declared himself a \"not-for-profit\" actor, pledging to use all the money he earns for good causes.",
      "The 56-year-old, who has starred in films such as Frost/Nixon and The Damned United, also sold his houses to make sure the 2019 Homeless World Cup went ahead in Cardiff.",
      "Appearing on the One Show on Tuesday, the actor explained how exactly the system of debts work.",
      "It sees people's debts get put into a bundle, with a debt-buying company then able to buy those bundles at a lower price.",
      "Despite the money being owed by people remaining the same, the companies that own the debt can then sell them for less and less money.",
      "Sheen said he was able to set up a debt acquisition company with \u00a3100,000 of his own money to buy \u00a31m worth of debt because it had come down in value.",
      "Although the system was \"bizarre\" and he initially had \"no idea\" how it worked, Sheen said \"it seemed like a good thing to do\".",
      "The company was not set up in Sheen's name and he had to be at \"arm's length from it\".",
      "He did not know the identity of people's debts he paid off, he only knew where they lived and the kind of debt it was.",
      "Sheen added: \"I would never know who they are - I still don't know who they are.\"",
      "During the making of the documentary, the process became far more complicated than he anticipated.",
      "\"I thought I would only work on this for a few weeks or a month or something, and it turned into two years, because we had to do it secretly,\" he said.",
      "Sheen added that setting up the company took so long that at a one point he felt like he wasn't going to be able to keep doing it.",
      "His mindset changed after filming in a cafe in his hometown of Port Talbot as the local steelworks prepared to close.",
      "\"The woman who worked at the cafe we were filming in told me the story of the men sitting on every table in tears, who were losing their jobs,\" he said.",
      "\"And I just thought - then, it really hits home, I just thought anything I can do [to help]\".",
      "The hour-long documentary will air on Channel 4 on Monday 10 March - five months after the last remaining blast furnace was closed in Port Talbot - which brought an end to the traditional method of steelmaking in south Wales.",
      "As a result, Tata Steel announced that 2,800 jobs were going to be cut which created uncertainty and stress for many families.",
      "Currently, Sheen confirmed that he has helped 900 people with their debts across south Wales.",
      "He added that due to the \"stigma\" around discussing money, some people might not even realise their debts have been paid off, and therefore he urged people to check their accounts.",

      "Other winners on the night included Kieran Culkin, Adrien Brody and Zoe Salda\u00f1a, while Flow won best animated film and I'm Still Here took home the best international prize.",
      "In her speech, 25-year-old Madison said: \"This is very surreal. I grew up in Los Angeles but Hollywood always felt so far away from me, so to be here standing in this room today is really incredible.\"",
      "She added: \"I want to honour and recognise the sex worker community. I will continue to support and be an ally... the women I've had the privilege of meeting from that community has been one of the highlights of this entire incredible experience.\"",

      "\"Where did we fall in love with movies? At the movie theatres,\" Baker said. \"Watching a film in a theatre with an audience is an experience.",
      "\"And at a time when the world can feel very divided, this is more important than ever, it's a communal experience you just don't get at home.",
      "\"Right now the theatre-going experience is under threat, independently owned theatres are struggling, and it's up to us to support them.\"",
      "He concluded: \"This is my battle cry: Film-makers, keep making films for the big screen. I know I will. Distributors, please focus first and foremost on the theatrical releases of my films.\"",
      "Baker is the first person to win four Oscars for a single film. Walt Disney did win four prizes in a single night in 1953, but for four different films.",

      "Brody had not been nominated at the Oscars since 2003, when he became the youngest ever winner of best actor for The Pianist.",
      "\"Acting is a very fragile profession,\" he said. \"It looks very glamorous, and in certain moments it is, but the one thing I've gained in having the privilege to come back here is to have some perspective.",
      "\"And no matter where you are in your career, no matter what you've accomplished, it can all go away. And what makes this night so special is the awareness of that, and the gratitude I have to still do the work that I love.\"",
      "Brody refused to be played off during his five-minute speech, continuing: \"I'm here once again to represent the lingering traumas and repercussions of war, and systematic oppression, and antisemitism and racism.",
      "\"And I pray for a healthier, happier and more inclusive world. And I believe if the past can teach us anything, it's a reminder to not let hate go unchecked.\"",

      "\"I am floored by this honour,\" she said in an emotional acceptance speech. \"Thank you to the Academy for recognising the quiet heroism and the power in a woman like Rita,\" referring to her character.",
      "\"My grandmother came to this country in 1961,\" she added, \"I am a proud child of immigrant parents, and I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award, and I know I will not be the last.\"",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez also won best original song for El Mal, a song performed by Salda\u00f1a in the film.",

      "He thanked the film's writer and director Jesse Eisenberg, telling him: \"Thank you for this movie, you're a genius. I'd never say that to your face, I'll never say it again, so soak it up.\"",
      "Culkin also paid tribute to his Succession co-star Jeremy Strong, who was nominated in the same category.",
      "Firefighters recognised",
      "The Oscars came two months after wildfires devastated Los Angeles. The ceremony opened with a montage of film clips featuring shots of the city, concluding with the slogan: \"We love LA.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.",
      "But he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.",
      "Miranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.",
      "\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"",
      "She told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.",
      "That film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.",

      "Madison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.",
      "When she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.",
      "\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.",
      "They \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.",
      "We've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.",
      "Some praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".",
      "'I debated not showing up'",
      "Edie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.",
      "Turquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.",
      "She got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.",
      "\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.",
      "\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"",
      "Turquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.",
      "\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"",
      "But when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.",
      "\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"",
      "Baker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.",
      "She says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.",
      "They connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.",
      "'I taught Mikey stripper slang'",
      "In the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "Miranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.",
      "\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.",
      "One of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"",
      "Rejection, heartbreak, and Tupperware boxes",
      "This section contains spoilers for Anora",
      "Miranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.",
      "\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"",
      "Turquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.",
      "\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.",
      "\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"",
      "But overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.",
      "\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.",
      "\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"",
      "She said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".",
      "\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"",
      "\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"",
      "For Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.",
      "\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\"",
      "For Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.",
      "In the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.",
      "We also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.",
      "\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.",
      "\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"",
      "Oscar hopes",
      "When Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.",
      "Footage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.",
      "\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.",
      "Now, all eyes are on the Oscars.",
      "Miranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.",
      "\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"",
      "She said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.",
      "\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.",

      "We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.",
      "It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").",

      "It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.",
      "Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.",
      "It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.",
      "Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.",

      "And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.",
      "It's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.",
      "Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".",
      "The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.",
      "We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.",
      "Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.",
      "\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.",
      "\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'",
      "Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".",
      "We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.",
      "There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.",
      "\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.",
      "There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.",

      "Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.",
      "Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.",

      "That, for film director Barry Sonnenfeld, is how he'll remember Gene Hackman, who has died at the age of 95.",
      "The endless hours in hair and makeup, repeated takes, and studio notes all frustrated Hackman, Sonnenfeld told BBC News.",
      "So too did actors who showed up not knowing their lines - notably John Travolta, who Hackman clashed with on the set of 1995 film Get Shorty, which Sonnenfeld directed.",
      "In the days since the news of Hackman's death, I've been speaking to people here in Los Angeles and beyond, who, like Sonnenfeld, knew and worked with him.",
      "What's immediately clear is how seriously Hackman took acting, and how meticulously he dealt with scripts.",
      "But what's also clear is that he was wary of the trappings of Hollywood.",
      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner, died alongside his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, and their dog at his home in New Mexico. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.",
      "Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February, 10 days before the couples' bodies were found.",
      "'He put the fear of God into me'",
      "In LA, Hackman's face is everywhere on television bulletins and on newspapers.",
      "His death was all anyone was talking about as stars gathered for pre-Oscars parties.",
      "I was at one of those events on Thursday night, where the American actor John C Reilly told me that he expected the Academy to commemorate Hackman on Sunday. \"I don't see how you could have the Oscars without mentioning a great like him who's passed.\"",
      "For Sonnenfeld and for the Irish director John Moore \u2013 who directed Hackman in 2001's Behind Enemy Lines \u2013 it was Hackman's way of dealing with scripts that demonstrated his brilliance. He would remove all of the scriptwriter's notes about how his character should deliver his lines.",
      "\"Because he didn't want any screenwriter to tell him how he was supposed to feel at that moment,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"So he had unique cut and pasted scripts that had no information from the writer about anything, because he wanted to make those choices, not the writer.\"",
      "Moore recalls a similar incident from the very first time he filmed with Hackman.",
      "\"He was just quietly sitting there, taking script pages out, cutting them up, removing extraneous stuff like scene descriptions, and then sticking them back onto blank pages,\" he said.",
      "He said Hackman told him: \"Acting is my job, you do the rest.\"",
      "\"It put the fear of God into me,\" Moore said, laughing.",
      "\"It was essentially him saying: 'I don't need anything, as I'm that good. You better bring your A-game, as I'm bringing mine.'\"",
      "It wasn't just superfluous studio notes that bothered Hackman.",
      "\"He had this conflict in that he was this brilliant actor but he hated the tropes of what it took to act in movies,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "\"[He] hated putting on makeup. The putting on of wardrobe. The wardrobe person after takes, taking their lip brush and rubbing down their wardrobe. The makeup person recombing his hair while he's talking to me,\" he said.",
      "\"All that sort of fussy hair and makeup and all that stuff, I think that drove him crazy.\"",
      "Nor did he often want to socialise after filming, said Moore.",
      "\"I'd try and have a drink with him after we'd shoot, and go up to the minibar,\" he said.",
      "\"He'd have one, that was it. [Betsy] would give him that look, and off it would be to bed. And he was in great shape in the morning as a result.\"",

      "Hackman responded: \"Nothing except learn the lines,\" to which Travolta replied, \"Well that's a waste of a weekend,\" according to Sonnenfeld.",

      "He responded by saying the business was, for him, \"very stressful\".",
      "\"The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast, and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it anymore.\"",

      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",

      "In animal experiments they showed the drug enhanced the ability of the immune system to fight back.",
      "The team at the University of Cambridge said it was an exciting and surprise discovery that could eventually lead to cancer patients being prescribed the drug - but not yet and people are advised against just taking the pills themselves.",
      "Regular aspirin comes with risks and trials are still trying to figure out which patients are most likely to benefit.",
      "Tantalising data from more than a decade ago showed people who were already taking a daily aspirin were more likely to survive if they were diagnosed with cancer.",
      "But how?",
      "It appears to centre on a moment of vulnerability for a cancer - when a lone cell breaks off from the original tumour and tries, like a seed on the wind, to spread elsewhere in the body.",
      "This process is called metastasis and is the cause of the majority of deaths from cancer.",
      "Part of our immune defences - a white blood cell called a T-cell - can swoop in and destroy the spreading cancer as it tries to take root.",
      "But the study showed that another part of our blood - the platelets that normally stop bleeding - were suppressing the T-cells and making it harder for them to take out the cancer.",
      "Aspirin disrupts the platelets and removes their influence over the T-cells so they can hunt out the cancer.",
      "Prof Rahul Roychoudhuri, from the University of Cambridge, told me: \"What we've discovered is that aspirin might work, surprisingly, by unleashing the power of the immune system to recognize and kill metastasizing cancer cells.\"",

      "The most natural question for anybody with cancer to ask is should they be taking aspirin.",
      "\"If you are a cancer patient, don't rush to your local pharmacy to buy aspirin just yet, but actively consider participation in ongoing or upcoming trials of aspirin,\" says Prof Mangesh Thorat, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Queen Mary University of London.",
      "He says the study provided \"the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle\" in understanding how aspirin works, but there were still questions to answer.",
      "Aspirin can cause dangerous internal bleeding including strokes so the risks have to be balanced. It is also not clear whether the effect works for all cancer or just specific ones. And this is still animal research so while the scientists think this would apply in people that will still need to be confirmed.",
      "Some patients - with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of cancers - are already recommended aspirin.",
      "But it will still take proper clinical trials to understand whether more patients would benefit too.",
      "These are already under way. Prof Ruth Langley, from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, is leading the Add-Aspirin trial to see if aspirin can stop early stage cancers from coming back.",
      "She said the study's results were \"an important discovery\" as they would help to work out \"who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis\".",
      "However, she again warned of the risks of taking aspirin and to \"always talk to your doctor before starting\".",
      "In the long-run, Prof Roychoudhuri suspects new drugs would be developed that take the benefits of aspirin, but with fewer of the risky side-effects.",
      "'Eureka moment'",
      "The discovery, published in the journal Nature, happened by accident as the scientists were not researching aspirin.",
      "The team in Cambridge were investigating how the immune system responded to cancers when they spread.",
      "They were using genetically engineered mice and found those lacking a specific set of genetic instructions were less likely to get metastatic cancer that had spread.",
      "Further investigation revealed how those T-cells were being suppressed and this started to overlap with how aspirin was known to work in the body.",
      "Dr Jie Yang, who carried out the research, said: \"It was a Eureka moment.",
      "\"It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of inquiry than we had anticipated.\"",

      "At-home tests for men worried about prostate cancer can give inconsistent and inaccurate results, BBC News has found.",
      "The tests, which resemble a Covid lateral flow strip, turn positive if a high level of a protein called PSA is detected in a drop of blood.",
      "Of five rapid tests analysed by the BBC, one did not work, three were negative or all-clear, but one returned a false positive result - all from the same blood sample.",
      "Prostate Cancer UK said it had significant concerns about the sale of the tests given their \"questionable accuracy\" and the absence of a doctor to interpret the results.",
      "Fifty and older",
      "There is no national prostate cancer screening programme in the UK, unlike for breast, bowel and cervical cancer.",
      "Instead, the onus is on men to request a blood test from their GP once they are over 50 years old, or from 45 for higher risk groups.",
      "That NHS test, which is processed in a laboratory, measures the level of PSA released by the prostate, a small gland involved in the production of semen.",
      "A high PSA level does not mean you have cancer but is a warning sign which can then lead to further scans and tests to rule out the disease.",
      "PSA levels can be high for a number of other reasons - including an infection, recent vigorous exercise or sex - or in some rare cases remain normal despite cancer.",
      "Google search data suggests interest in testing has risen sharply since the Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy went public with his own diagnosis in October 2024.",
      "Dozens of companies now sell self-testing kits designed to measure PSA levels.",
      "They are available online and from some pharmacies and convenience stores with prices from \u00a36 to \u00a395.",
      "They come in two main types:",

      "rapid tests which give a result in minutes and display a dark line if PSA is detected above a certain level",
      "The BBC analysed five rapid tests all bought online from different companies, using a blood sample taken on the same day.",
      "The UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, says in its guidance that over-the-counter PSA kits are \"not a reliable indicator of prostate cancer\" and must not \"claim to detect cancer\".",
      "Instead, at-home tests are often marketed as a way to \"screen\" for the disease or \"assess prostate cancer risk\", language the regulator says would be allowed under the current rules.",
      "One of the home tests ordered by the BBC also arrived in packaging and with instructions clearly marked \"for professional use only\".",
      "Charity wants testing of men at high risk of prostate cancer",
      "What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?",

      "For someone with no medical experience, the kits can be difficult to use.",
      "A disposable lancet must pierce the skin, before drops of blood can be sucked into a pipette, mixed with a chemical and placed in the test cassette.",
      "Of the five kits analysed by the BBC, one did not produce a readable result; three came back all clear; but one did show a solid dark line, indicating a PSA level above 4.0 ug/l.",
      "A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ug/l.",
      "\"As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy,\" says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK.",
      "\"That's a big problem because they can falsely reassure people who really do have elevated levels of PSA and should seek further testing, or they can cause undue worry among people who are absolutely fine.\"",
      "Online reviews appear to bear that out.",
      "In one, a customer posted that he was \"really scared\" after two rapid home tests indicated a high PSA level. A later NHS test showed his reading was normal.",
      "In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for \"peace of mind\" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.",
      "The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\".",
      "Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP.",
      "In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history.",
      "Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative.",
      "\"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400,\" he adds.",
      "\"You just don't get that level of information from a fast home test, so patients might not get the full picture.\"",
      "'Dangerously outdated'",
      "Prostate Cancer UK describes the growth of home testing as \"the symptom of a wider problem\".",
      "\"Too many men still don't realise they can access tests through a GP and the guidelines for doctors are dangerously outdated,\" says Amy Rylance from the charity.",
      "Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing.",
      "The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries.",
      "Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward.",
      "A spokesman for the Department of Health says it has asked the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the NHS, to review the evidence on testing, with a response expected later this year.",
      "\"Prostate cancer patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment but through our National Cancer Plan we will transform the way we treat cancer,\" he added."

      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

      "However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million.",
      "Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese.",
      "The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.",
      "Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems.",

      "She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.",

      "\"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment.",

      "Netflix's new drama Toxic Town revisits one of the UK's biggest environmental scandals: the Corby toxic waste case.",
      "The series tells the story of families fighting for justice after children in the Northamptonshire town were born with birth defects, believed to be caused by industrial pollution.",
      "Corby's steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks.",
      "By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination.",
      "In 2009, after a long legal battle, the High Court ruled Corby Borough Council was negligent in managing the waste.",
      "Families affected won an undisclosed financial settlement in 2010, held in trust until the children turned 18.",
      "Alongside the drama, a BBC Radio Northampton podcast series offers a deeper look into the real-life events, using original court transcripts and newly uncovered documents.",
      "Introducing... The Toxic Waste Scandal",
      "Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted.",
      "Here are some of the key voices behind the story.",
      "'The first person you are going to blame is yourself'",
      "George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby.",
      "Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift.",
      "Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers George's birth, an event that would change their lives forever.",
      "Born \"navy blue\" as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care.",
      "It was then Fiona noticed something unusual.",
      "\"I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger,\" she says.",
      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",
      "Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. \"The first time I saw my hand, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't sad. It was better than before.\"",
      "But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions.",
      "'Did I do this?'",
      "Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything.",
      "On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, at Kettering General Hospital.",
      "Simone was born with three fingers on each hand.",
      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",
      "Despite her initial self-doubt, Lisa \"knew\" she had done nothing wrong, as she had neither drunk nor smoked during pregnancy.",
      "She recalls the lack of follow-up care or investigation into her daughter's condition.",
      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",
      "Simone coped by using humour. She would joke that her mum had chopped off her fingers or that she was part alien, turning her differences into something entertaining.",
      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",
      "\"They admitted they didn't really know if it would help. By then, I'd adapted. I live with daily pain, but I didn't want to risk making things worse.\"",
      "Meeting her now-husband, she initially hid her hands, subtly positioning herself to avoid detection.",
      "Eventually, she told him - through a long message and sending him a link to the 2020 Horizon documentary about the case.",
      "His response? \"It's really not a big deal.\"",
      "Today, she is grateful for the legal battle her family fought. \"It set me up for life,\" she says.",
      "\"I was able to start my own life, and I went to university. I've got my own house and my daughter had the best start in life.\"",
      "'It felt like we were an inconvenience'",
      "Lewis Waterfield was born in 1994 with deformities to both hands.",
      "His father worked near the contaminated site as a roofer, and his pregnant mother often visited him there.",
      "\"My dad noticed something wasn't right straight away,\" Lewis recalls.",
      "As a child, he endured disruptive hospital stays, including an unsuccessful attempt to graft a toe on to his hand to create a functioning finger.",
      "\"I've had extensive surgery, but there are limits to what can be done.\"",
      "During the legal battle, Lewis's parents fought to prove a link between industrial pollution and birth defects.",
      "\"The council, I remember, was dismissive. It felt like we were an inconvenience to them.\"",
      "Now a senior lecturer in public health at the University of Northampton, Lewis acknowledges how his experiences shaped him.",
      "\"Every now and then, someone asks about my hands, and it takes me right back.\" he says.",
      "\"But I don't mind. It's part of who I am.\"",
      "Corby Borough Council ceased to exist in 2021 when it merged with other authorities to become North Northamptonshire Council.",
      "In 2010, its then chief executive, Chris Mallender, issued a formal apology over the scandal.",
      "\"The council extends its deepest sympathy to the children and their families,\" it said.",
      "\"Although I accept that money cannot properly compensate these young people for their disabilities and for all that they've suffered to date and their problems in the future, the council sincerely hopes that this apology, coupled with today's agreement, will mean they can now put their legal battle behind them and proceed with their lives with a greater degree of financial certainty.\"",

    "story": [
      "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.",
      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cancer patients and others with debilitating conditions have highlighted shortages of a vital drug they say have had a \"devastating\" impact on their lives.",
      "Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (Pert), helps digestion, but has been hard to obtain for the last year and shortages are predicted to last until 2026.",
      "It is thought more than 61,000 patients in the UK need it, including those with pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis.",
      "Some patients said through Your Voice, Your BBC News that they have had to cover long distances to find a pharmacist with supplies.",
      "The Department of Health and Social care says it is working closely with the NHS, manufacturers and others in the supply chain to try to resolve the issues.",
      "Without the drug, patients lose weight and strength, which means their ability to cope with treatment such as chemotherapy is reduced.",
      "Diana Gibb, who is 74, and her husband Mick, 78, live in Tonbridge, Kent.",
      "Mick had a major operation to treat pancreatic cancer in 2023. Diana wrote to BBC News explaining that it is impossible for Mick to digest food without creon. She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine.",
      "\"We started to have trouble getting them in the higher dosage, involving me traipsing round pharmacies to find one who could get them. Pharmacies cannot get hold of that dosage. He now has to take a lower dose doubling up on the number of tablets taken, one box now lasts less than a week.",
      "\"Pharmacies cannot get hold of lower dosage either and there is no alternative medication. I was worried that my husband would starve to death without them.\"",
      "Diana says for now they can get supplies of the drug but there is no guarantee week-to-week, and that is still a big worry.",
      "Bryony Thomas, who is from Stroud in Gloucestershire, needs creon after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Her cancer is now in remission, but she is still reliant on the drug for her digestive system to work correctly.  She says there was no availability to get the medication within her county, and she had to get her mother-in-law to make a two-hour journey to a pharmacy in Crewe.",
      "At one stage, she says she obtained the drug from another patient, who had a surplus, against regulations via Instagram. She describes her situation as \"constantly stressful\".",
      "Leading pancreatic clinicians and charities including Pancreatic Cancer UK have written to the prime minister saying the absence of Pert can have a \"devastating impact on people's lives\", with doctors and pharmacists \"inundated with requests for help from desparate patients\".",
      "The letter says that without the drug, people experience \"horrendous bowel symptoms, poor diabetes control, malnutrition, and reduced absorption of other medications, all of which can have a massive impact on their health and quality of life\".",
      "There are other forms of Pert, but the charities and medical experts say while other countries have many brands available, in the UK creon \"holds a very high market share\".  They say that with creon running short, switching by patients has depleted stocks of the alternatives. They are calling for a national process for importing Pert.",
      "Worry and stress",
      "The Cystic Fibrosis Trust says the shortages have caused \"significant worry and stress for those affected\".",
      "The charity has told patients that a \"shortage of raw ingredients is straining the manufacturing process and disrupting global supply chains\".",
      "Production of creon is said to rely heavily on pancreatic enzymes sourced from pigs.  The Royal Pharmaceutical Society meanwhile is calling on the government to adopt a national strategy to manage medicine shortages.",
      "There have been wider problems with drug shortages. The National Pharmacy Association, representing community chemists in the UK, sought views on the issue.",
      "Of the 500 which responded, all said they were unable to dispense a prescription at least once a day because of supply problems, and a large majority said patients came in at least once a day to get medicines they had failed to get elsewhere.",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We know how frustrating and distressing medicine supply issues can be for patients, and the pharmacists and clinicians caring for them.",
      "\"We've issued guidance to healthcare professionals and encourage anyone concerned to consult their clinician.\"",

      "The PM did not respond directly but said: \"We work very closely with the United States on defence, on security and on intelligence.\"",
      "He also insisted the US was still \"a reliable ally\" despite the move to suspend aid to Ukraine.",
      "Earlier, the head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), John Ratcliffe, appeared to confirm the US had also cut off intelligence sharing with Ukraine alongside aid.",
      "Following the session in the Commons, Sir Keir's official spokesman was asked whether the UK would still be allowed to pass on American intelligence to Kyiv.",
      "\"It does remain a long-standing position not to comment on intelligence, but what I would say is that we have been clear previously that we will do everything to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position across all aspects of our support, particularly around defence and security, and that position hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "It was an unusually quiet PMQs, with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch restrained in her exchanges with Sir Keir.",
      "While she praised the prime minister's efforts during his visit to Washington last week, Badenoch also pressed him over what further steps were been taken to obtain a US security guarantee for Ukraine.",
      "In response, Sir Keir said he did discuss security guarantees with Donald Trump and the president made clear his commitment to the Nato principle that if one member of the alliance is attacked, others will come to their aid.",

    "summary": "The briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant.",
    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: \"There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship.\"",
      "\"Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice,\" they added.",
      "However others, including from the left of the party, said they recognised the welfare system was \"old fashioned\" and needed reform.",
      "\"We have people who can work but don't just automatically because the system is inflexible,\" one said.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",
      "Privately ministers and officials have been dismayed by the quality of the Whitehall machine.",
      "The government is expected to demand major reductions in the numbers of civil servants, though this is unlikely to take the form of a specific numerical target.",
      "Ministers are also understood to have discussed major changes to the machinery of government, namely how government departments are organised, though this work is considered unlikely to come to fruition this month."

      "Lord Soames said the UK was still \"very, very, very good\" at intelligence and security and asked if that would still play a role in the UK-US relationship.",
      "Sir David said the question of intelligence-sharing was going to be \"more difficult to approach\".",
      "\"Clearly if you have some Trump supportees in these key jobs who have very strange track records and have said very strange things about Nato allies and the Nato alliance and you have people in the administration who seem to be looking for ways of appeasing Russia then you have a problem on the intelligence front.",
      "\"That is a big question mark against how the special relationship is sustained during the Trump administration.\"",
      "Dame Karen said the way the US and UK helped each other was \"unique\" adding: \"There is an interoperability that you don't find with any other ally.\"",
      "Asked if that would last under the Trump presidency, she replied: \"The intelligence part of the relationship is so valuable it will last \u2013 even if as David was explaining - at the top level there might be things we might wish to be a bit circumspect about.\"",
      "Sir Nigel said \"the nature of the people at the top of the US intelligence and security apparatus today - the ones chosen by President Trump - I think that may present some difficulties in terms of their views of us and views of co-operation.\"",
      "\"This is going to be trickier to handle than probably at any other time.\"",
      "Sir Peter Westmacott, who was in Washington from 2012 to 2016, said problems might be caused by a changing culture in US government institutions adding that \"a lot of very good people are being thrown out because they do not pass the loyalty test.\"",
      "However, he also told the committee that it was not unheard of for intelligence to occasionally be held back from allies \"even when you have the most perfect working political relationship\".",
      "\"There are moment when because of the risk of an inadvertent leak to a journalist or something specific source information for example is held back.\""

      "The Energy Profits Levy (EPL) was introduced in May 2022 after companies recorded skyrocketing profits due to a sharp rise in energy prices.",
      "It was increased in the most recent UK government budget last year and means oil and gas producers are paying a headline tax rate of 78%.",
      "The consultation seeks views on a new tax which would be triggered either when energy prices or profits are exceptionally high.",
      "The department for energy security and net zero said it would work to develop a plan that would deliver a \"fair return for the nation during times of unusually high prices\".",

      "Oil firm blames windfall tax for North Sea pull-out",
      "That comes after the UK government admitted plans for the Rosebank oil field off Shetland had been approved unlawfully after the decision was challenged in court by environmental campaigners.",
      "The Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \"The North Sea will be at the heart of Britain's energy future. For decades, its workers, businesses and communities have helped power our country and our world.",
      "\"Oil and gas production will continue to play an important role and, as the world embraces the drive to clean energy, the North Sea can power our plan for change and clean energy future in the decades ahead.\"",
      "Oil and gas companies had posted record profits after wholesale prices spiked amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The EPL was introduced by the previous Conservative government, which set the rate at 25% and put it in place until 2025.",
      "It was later increased to 35% by then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt and would run until at least 2029.",
      "Current chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that had been extended until at least 2030 and increased again by 3% in October 2024.",
      "The latest rise prompted the US-based firm Apache to announce it would end its North Sea operations by 2029.",

      "The price per barrel of oil has since fallen significantly.",
      "Trade association Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) previously warned the tax increase would stifle investment in the sector.",

      "Alongside oil and gas production, the government said it wanted to ensure the North Sea would become a \"world-leading example\" for offshore clean energy.",
      "It said it was \"committed\" to working with the sector, trade unions and other organisations on a \"phased transition\" for the oil and gas industry.",
      "However, energy minister Michael Shanks was unable to guarantee new discoveries of oil wells near current licenced sites would not be exploited.",
      "The industry has been calling for flexibility if oil wells spread into nearby areas which are not licenced while current permits remain in place.",

      "'Future-proofed jobs'",
      "The department for energy security and net zero said \"tens of thousands\" of more jobs could created in offshore renewables.",
      "It said the denial of future oil and gas exploration licences was required to keep global warming to the target of 1.5C, but said it would \"engage\" with the sector on how to manage existing fields for the remainder of their lifespan.",
      "Mel Evans, climate team leader at Greenpeace UK, said: \"Our over-reliance on volatile and expensive fossil fuels is the reason our energy bills have remained so high in recent years.",
      "\"With yet more uncertain times ahead, this is a step worth celebrating from the government.",
      "\"The only way forward for a secure future means ending our reliance on oil and gas. The government clearly recognises that creating a renewable energy system can provide this country and its energy workers with economic opportunities and stable, future-proofed jobs.\"",
      "Tessa Khan, executive director of environmental campaign group Uplift, said the plans were \"long overdue\".",
      "She said: \"The government is right to draw a line under new licensing, which won't slow the decline in jobs or boost the UK's energy supply.",
      "\"This government now needs to make sure the transition to clean energy delivers for those workers and communities that are currently tied to the declining oil and gas industry.",
      "\"That means creating more good, secure jobs and new industries like wind manufacturing and decommissioning in the places that need them.\"",
      "The Unite union said it welcomed the government's plans, but warned it must be more than a \"listening exercise\".",

      "It is \"Stop the Boats\".",
      "Yet, in his first wide-ranging interview since leaving Downing Street, the former prime minister says he regrets ever saying it because it was \"too stark..too binary\".",
      "And he concedes that it couldn't actually be delivered.",
      "This is just one of the \"lessons from Downing Street\" which the man who presided over the worst ever election defeat for the Conservative Party says he's learned, in a conversation lasting more than two hours for my Political Thinking podcast.",
      "It covers not only the mistakes he thinks he made, but also the disagreements about the right way to manage the economy that he had with Boris Johnson; the radical ideas he wishes he could've implemented; the lessons he learned from being chancellor during the Covid pandemic - and his attitudes to race and faith and Englishness as the first British Asian prime minister.",
      "Sunak is in reflective mood talking about a job he was catapulted into, saying he didn't \"probably have the time to enjoy it in the moment or appreciate it in the moment because of the context in which I was doing it.\"",
      "That context was not just an economic crisis but a political one.",
      "The Tories were on their third leader in just 50 days, and there'd been no election of party members or the wider public.",
      "\"I didn't have a mandate,\" he says, and defends his approach of trying to bring warring factions together.",
      "To do otherwise, he says, \"would have been a huge gamble because the thing just could have collapsed. And would that have been good for the country? I don't think so. I think what the country needed was stability.\"",
      "He's not changed his mind about wanting to deport migrants who cross the channel to Rwanda, and says he now backs leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), if it's not reformed.",
      "He says the court has \"taken on new powers. There's been mission creep...It does need to reform or we should leave.\"",
      "When I asked him if he had taken his eye off the ball in regards to soaring levels of net migration, he concedes that although he \"took very strong action to bring the levels of legal migration down\u2026I should have done them sooner\".",
      "Stopping small boats is a priority for people - Sunak",
      "'Stop the boats' slogan was error, says Cleverly",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Sunak was in many ways an accidental prime minister. It was October 2022, and he learned that Liz Truss had survived in the job for less time than that famous lettuce, whilst having a meal with his two daughters at TGI's in Teesside after a game of bowling.",
      "Four days later, he walked into Number 10 as her successor.",
      "He says he \"had very mixed feelings\u2026given what had happened\" but was driven by Hindu belief in dharma which he says involves \"doing your duty\".",
      "\"You've just got to focus on doing your best, doing what you're there to do, and not worry about the rest,\" he says.",
      "\"It was a very helpful concept for me\u2026I kept coming back to that. I said, 'look, this is my job. This is what I'm here to do. I'm well-placed to try and solve the economic challenge that our country is facing'.\"",
      "Bringing the economy back under control after the markets panicked in the face of Truss's unfunded tax cuts \u2013 or what he calls \"fantasy economics\" - is the achievement he's clearly proudest of.",
      "However, he spells out for the first time the scale of the disagreements he had not just with Truss, but with Boris Johnson, who he served as Chancellor.",
      "\"He and I had quite different views on economic policy. I'm a small state conservative. I believe in prioritising, trying to restrain the growth of public spending, being careful with our borrowing so that we can cut people's taxes...he was less worried about those things.\"",
      "He tells me that at their regular Sunday night dinners in Downing Street they argued over what could and could not be afforded.",
      "He says his worries were inflation and interest rates rising, because \"when they go up it's going to have a big impact on our public finances, because we're going to have to pay more to service the debt that we've got\".",
      "He adds: \"We cannot afford to keep spending and borrowing at this rate, and that means you have to prioritise. We can't do everything.\"",
      "Sunak insisted that any plan to subsidise people's social care costs had to be paid for by higher taxes.",
      "Now he thinks \"we're having another review now...I tell you, the answer is, do we as a country think it's right to pay more taxes for a more generous social care policy? Yes or no? I personally think the answer is no.\"",
      "He believed in slashing billions from welfare bills, a more \"radical restructuring of the state\" to pay for increased defence spending, and he says he told Johnson that the UK's net zero obligations were saddling the economy with cost.",
      "Now he argues for abandoning the legal commitment to deliver net zero, made law by another Tory leader Theresa May.",
      "During the Covid pandemic both Sunak and Johnson faced fixed term penalties for breaking lockdown rules.",
      "Sunak tells me he thought long and hard about resigning after that but says he had a job to do and he clearly can still scarcely believe that he was fined for turning up at a work meeting early where a cake was produced for the prime minister's birthday.",
      "Much more interesting is the lesson he draws from that period.",
      "We should all have been treated more like grown-ups, he tells me, and the public should have told that \"even the scientists themselves are not united on this, or they don't 100% know that this is the right thing to do\".",
      "The long-term negative consequences of lockdown measures should have been spelt out because, he says, \"we've seen the impact it's had on school kids everywhere and the impact it's had on their learning. And we probably didn't talk about that as much as we could have done at the time.\"",
      "Sunak is proud to have been the first British Asian prime minister and talks movingly of the moment his grandfather \u2013 who'd been born poor in an Indian village \u2013 calling an old friend at home with tears in his eyes on his first visit to Westminster.",
      "He's angry too with those like a popular podcaster who declared recently: \"He's a brown Hindu; how is he English.\"",

      "\"On this definition, you can't be English even playing for England, let alone supporting them... I genuinely thought it was ridiculous.\"",
      "Here is a man proud of his roots and ready to admit mistakes, but who is wondering whether his rise to the top all happened before the country knew him, and could see beyond the super-wealthy Tory who was the fifth Tory leader in just six years.",
      "\"It's a lonely job,\" he says, \"because it is 100% only on you.\"",
      "Many were sure that he'd called the election early to head off to a new life in California.",
      "Nonsense, he says, he lives here because it's home and indeed has just set up a charitable foundation \u2013 the Richmond Project \u2013 named after the constituency in Yorkshire, which he's still proud to represent in Parliament.",

    "story": [
      "Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales.",
      "The Ministry of Justice's announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm.",
      "The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts.",
      "There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood.",
      "Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028.",
      "The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers' strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails.",
      "Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court.",
      "She said a cap on sitting days had a \"drastic effect\", with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog.",
      "A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was \"unprecedented\", but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem.",
      "\"The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise,\" she told the Today programme.",
      "\"We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts,\" she added.",
      "But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt \"out of reach\" for many victims, which was causing extra trauma.",
      "One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back.",
      "Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4% to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under \"immense pressure\" because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever.",
      "\"With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support,\" she said.",
      "\"I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first.\"",
      "Separately, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had \"accepted\" court delays getting worse until recommendations from the major review into reforming the courts, led by retired judge Sir Brian Leveson, were implemented.",
      "The report said that the courts could not keep up with the rate of new cases arriving at their doors.",
      "Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee's chair, said: \"Our report is a terrible indictment of our criminal justice system and the government urgently need to reorganise it to aspire to that world-class standard for which the UK used to be renowned.\"",
      "Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, said that 110,000 sitting days was the minimum that had been needed since 2022.",
      "\"We welcome these additional sitting days... but to do our collective best to reduce the backlog we must ask for uncapped sitting days in the Crown Court for at least the next five years.\"",
      "Joanna Hardy-Susskind, a defence barrister and host of BBC Radio 4 justice series You Do Not Have to Say Anything, said the extra sitting days would only go so far to improve a system where the length of \"queues for justice\" were \"unacceptable\".",
      "\"This is a lifeboat, and it will help a little - but not for long,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "She added that the state of courtrooms were in \"a pretty dire way\", and funding was also needed for upkeep.",
      "\"There's not much point in opening courtrooms if I'm sitting there and the ceiling is leaking on my wig - if juror number four is sitting there in a hat and scarf because they're freezing and concentrate on a murder trial or on a rape trial,\" she said."

    "summary": "The US vice-president faces criticism after saying troops from \"some random country\" will not deter Russia.",
    "story": [
      "The US vice-president has sparked a row with his comments about a potential peacekeeping force in Ukraine.",
      "UK opposition politicians accused JD Vance of disrespecting British forces after he said a US stake in Ukraine's economy was a \"better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "The UK and France have said they would be willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine as part of a peace deal.",
      "Vance has since insisted he did not \"even mention the UK or France\", adding that both had \"fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond\".",
      "Zelensky vows to 'make things right' with Trump and negotiate peace",
      "JD Vance: The Maga loyalist who became vice-president",
      "However, he did not specify which country or countries he was referring to.",
      "In a post on social media, Vance added: \"But let's be direct: there are many countries who are volunteering (privately or publicly) support who have neither the battlefield experience nor the military equipment to do anything meaningful.\"",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, although Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously said a \"number of countries\" have agreed to.",
      "Vance's comments came as the US paused military aid to Ukraine, following an explosive spat between President Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week.",
      "Zelensky left the White House before a proposed deal on sharing Ukrainian minerals with American companies could be signed.",
      "Speaking about the proposal, Vance told Fox News: \"The very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine.",
      "\"That is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\"",
      "Sir Keir has said US security guarantees - such as air cover - will be needed to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine again, if there is a deal to end the war.",
      "However, Trump has so far refused to pledge this, instead arguing that US workers in Ukraine as part of a minerals deal could provide such assurances.",
      "'Erasing from history'",
      "Speaking in the French Parliament, France's Armed Forces Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu welcomed that Vance had \"corrected his remarks\".",
      "He paid tribute to the memory of French soldiers who had died in recent decades, earning applause from French MPs by saying they \"deserved the respect of our allies\".",
      "Earlier, Vance's original comments had drawn criticism from UK opposition politicians.",
      "Conservative shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge pointed out both the UK and France deployed forces alongside the US in Afghanistan, adding: \"It's deeply disrespectful to ignore such service and sacrifice.\"",
      "Asked about Vance's comments later, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the vice-president did not call Britain a \"random country\".",
      "\"A lot of people are getting carried away. They're saying loads of things and getting quite animated. Let's keep cool heads,\" she said.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said Vance was \"wrong, wrong, wrong\", adding that the UK \"stood by America\" for 20 years in Afghanistan.",
      "Liberal Democrat defence spokesperson Helen Maguire, a former captain in the Royal Military Police who served in Iraq, urged the UK's ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, to call on Vance to apologise for the comments.",
      "\"JD Vance is erasing from history the hundreds of British troops who gave their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" she said.",
      "She later told the BBC Vance's comments \"were clearly referring to the UK and France\", adding that they were \"deeply disrespectful\".",
      "'Real offence'",
      "Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty, a former British Army officer who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, said: \"The disrespect shown by the new US vice-president to the sacrifices of our service personnel is unacceptable.\"",
      "Speaking after Vance posted on social media to defend his comments, Obese-Jecty told BBC Two's Politics Live programme: \"It's difficult to see who he was talking about, if he wasn't talking about Britain and France.\"",
      "He called on the vice-president to clarify which countries he was referring to, and to apologise, adding that Vance had caused \"real offence\".",
      "Downing Street refused to be drawn on whether the prime minister found the comments insulting or disrespectful, but said he was \"full of admiration for all British troops who have served, for instance in Iraq and Afghanistan\".",
      "The UK joined the US invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, following the 9/11 attacks, with France also sending forces to the country.",
      "More than 150,000 British personnel have served in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, with the final troops withdrawing in 2021.",
      "The UK was also part of a US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003, with British forces in the country peaking at 46,000.",

      "No 10 would not comment directly on the pause without seeing the details of the announcement, and did not say whether Sir Keir had been given any guidance from the US before the move.",
      "Downing Street also said Sir Keir had spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday afternoon.",
      "The prime minister updated Zelensky on his discussion with President Trump last night and said it was \"vital that all parties worked towards a lasting and secure peace for Ukraine as soon as possible\", a No 10 spokeswoman said.",
      "The US is by far the biggest individual donor of military aid to Ukraine, providing weapons, equipment and financial support.",
      "The US has committed about $66bn (\u00a352bn) in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. The UK has committed \u00a37.8bn in military support during the same period.",
      "The US decision to pause military aid came hours after Trump criticised President Zelensky for saying the end of the war with Russia is \"very, very far away\".",
      "The pair had an explosive spat in the Oval Office last Friday, with Trump telling Zelensky he was \"gambling with World War Three\" by refusing to consider a ceasefire without US security guarantees.",
      "Zelensky left the White House before a proposed deal on sharing Ukrainian minerals with American companies could be signed.",
      "On Monday, the White House announced it was \"reviewing\" the delivery of ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine to \"ensure that it is contributing to a solution\".",
      "The order to pause all current American military aid to Ukraine takes effect immediately, and includes all US military equipment not currently in Ukraine, including weapons in transit and at depots in Poland.",
      "The pause will affect more than $1bn (\u00a3790m) in arms and ammunition, including rockets, anti-tank weapons, and armoured vehicles of the kind Ukraine has relied on in its effort to repel Russian forces.",
      "The pause in aid will heap more pressure on Zelensky to sign the minerals deal and agree to peace talks without the US security guarantees he has been seeking.",
      "Russia has tentatively welcomed the pause in US aid to Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a \"solution which could really push the Kyiv regime to a peace process\".",
      "Fedir Venislavsky, a member of  the Ukrainian Parliament's defence committee, said his country had a weapons stockpile that would last six months \"without consistent help from the US\".",

      "'Profoundly worrying'",
      "Reacting to the decision, Rayner told the BBC the Trump administration wanted Europe to step up and had been clear about its intentions to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "Rayner said the prime minister was also \"laser-focused on getting peace\".",
      "\"He won't be derailed by announcements,\" Rayner told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"He will continue that dialogue with our oldest and strongest ally, the US, and with European partners and with Ukraine.\"",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK and Europe must \"rearm faster\" following the US announcement.",

      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the pause in aid between the US and Ukraine only helped Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "He posted: \"I hope that Keir Starmer can use his new role to bring the two together and soon.\"",
      "Last week, Sir Keir met Trump at the White House, as the prime minister attempted the shape the American approach to ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Over the weekend, Sir Keir hosted a summit of western leaders, as they scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.",
      "The UK and France are taking a leading role and have both committed to send soldiers to Ukraine, under one proposal.",
      "But apart from increasing spending on defence, there appears to be no consensus on a plan to end the war among European leaders.",

      "On Monday, Rwanda's government spokesperson Yolande Makolo said the UK had asked Rwanda to \"quietly forgo\" the remaining payment - reportedly amounting to \u00a350m ($64m) - based on \"trust and good faith\".",

      "In a statement, a UK government spokesperson said that \"no further payments in relation to this policy will be made and Rwanda has waived any additional payments\".",
      "The row over payments linked to the Rwanda scheme comes after the UK government announced it would halt bilateral aid to the east African country last month, except for \"support to the poorest and most vulnerable\".",
      "The UK took the decision to cut aid after accusing the country of supporting M23, a rebel group that has captured swathes of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a deadly uprising.",
      "The aid cuts have amounted to \"unjustified punitive measures to coerce Rwanda into compromising our national security\", Makolo said on Monday.",
      "Rwanda has often denied backing the M23 rebel group, but has recently been more defensive, saying it has had to take measures to deal with the \"existential threat\" posed by genocidal militia near its borders.",
      "UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.",

      "Now King Charles seems to be in demand as never before to help out the politicians and to get involved, playing an unexpectedly pivotal role in dramatic times for international diplomacy.",
      "He met Canada's PM on Monday in the latest phase of this mixture of bridge building and fire-fighting.",
      "Last week an invitation from the King for a second state visit was offered to President Trump, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presenting it, with no shortage of flattery, as an \"unprecedented\" sign of friendship and respect.",
      "Then in the fallout of the disastrous Trump meeting with Zelensky in the White House, it was the King, as well as Sir Keir, who embraced the Ukrainian leader and offered a visible image of support for his embattled country.",
      "It was a vital element in the diplomatic balancing act taking place, as the UK government tries to shore up Western support for Ukraine, without alienating and aggravating the Trump administration in the US.",
      "It's placed the double act of King Charles and Sir Keir Starmer at the centre of some huge shifts in international relations.",
      "The King greeting President Zelensky so warmly and publicly, on a visit to Sandringham, was an important message of solidarity that he had not been abandoned and that there was still support for Ukraine, three years after it was invaded by Russia.",
      "With Trump's enthusiasm for the royals, and his evident keenness for a state visit, it provides a diplomatic bridge, with the King keeping open friendly channels with both Trump and Zelensky.",
      "Trump described the King as a \"beautiful man\", as he looked forward to the opulence of a state visit, with its carriage ride up the Mall and glittering banquet. Invitations for such visits are sent by the monarch, but the decisions on who gets invited are made in government.",
      "The King has decades of experience of getting along with people from remarkably different backgrounds and viewpoints. He seems to enjoy chatting to people, asking them about themselves, while saying little about his own views. He's also known generations of previous US leaders, all the way back to visiting Nixon in the White House and meeting Eisenhower at Balmoral.",
      "For King Charles, there has also been a very personal sense of support for Ukraine, he's been outspoken in a way that is unusual. He has attacked the \"indescribable aggression\" against Ukraine, in what he called an \"unprovoked attack on their land\".",
      "Soon after the invasion he went to see refugees arriving in Romania. On visits to France and Germany he singled out the importance of Western allies standing firm with Ukraine to protect democratic values.",
      "He's made repeated visits to meet the Ukrainian community in the UK and last month went to see a project providing medical assistance for injured Ukrainian military personnel.",
      "But these are complicated times for the monarch, not least because as well as being the UK's head of state, King Charles is also the head of state of Canada - and on Monday he faced a different set of agendas when he met Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "The words exchanged in those meetings are not revealed - but as well as discussing Ukraine, there would be no need to guess the other topic of conversation.",
      "\"Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation,\" said Trudeau ahead of the meeting.",
      "Canada is facing President Trump's calls for his northern neighbour, and longstanding Nato ally, to become the 51st state of the US. This unsurprisingly has deeply angered and offended many Canadians.",
      "They might look to King Charles as their head of state, and head of the Commonwealth too, to strongly speak up for them and to rebuff such expansionist claims from the US president.",
      "Except that from a UK perspective, the King is being deployed to keep President Trump on board and to keep alive the \"special relationship\" between the US and UK. So there will be no appetite for a royal denunciation over Canada.",

      "Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind",

      "\u200cIt won't be an easy balancing act, when so much of the King's diplomacy has to be in symbols as much as words. He has to speak on the advice of ministers, in Canada and the UK.",
      "It seems like a long time since one of the famous moments of unspoken royal commentary, when the late Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of a big bunch of flowers in the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow, in the weeks after the Russian invasion.",

      "His finance spokesman Sam Rowlands said the budget was \"merely a sticking plaster over the problems that far too many people face in Wales\".",
      "\"It won't lead to greater prosperity for our people. It won't put more money in people's pockets and it won't give us the public services that the people of Wales are crying out for.\"",

      "By Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales political editor",
      "Labour is asking voters to stick with it \u2013 in Wales and in Westminster \u2013  and to allow time for public services to improve.",
      "That could be a challenge, with forecasts suggesting tighter public spending in future years, low economic growth in the UK and global economic and political uncertainty \u2013 all of which could mean less money coming from Westminster for Welsh ministers to spend.",
      "And what if voters simply want change after what will be 27 years of Labour in power come the 2026 Senedd election?",
      "The other parties sense that change in the air and will spend the next year arguing that two Labour governments working together are not doing enough for Wales and that the Welsh government's spending priorities are wrong.",
      "Labour for its part tried to put Plaid on the defensive during the budget debate, accusing it of jeopardising billions of pounds of funding by not backing the spending plans."

      "International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds has resigned over the prime minister's cuts to the aid budget.",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Dodds said the cuts to international aid, announced earlier this week to fund an increase in defence spending, would \"remove food and healthcare from desperate people - deeply harming the UK's reputation\".",
      "She told the PM she had delayed her resignation until after his meeting with President Trump, saying it was \"imperative that you had a united cabinet behind you as you set off for Washington\".",
      "The Oxford East MP, who attended cabinet despite not being a cabinet minister, said it was with \"sadness\" that she was resigning.",
      "She said that while Sir Keir had been clear he was not \"ideologically opposed\" to international development, the cuts were \"being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAID\".",
      "Ahead of his trip to meet the US president, Sir Keir announced aid funding would be reduced from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to fund an increase in defence spending.",
      "In his reply to Dodds's resignation letter, the prime minister thanked the departing minister for her \"hard work, deep commitment and friendship\".",
      "He said cutting aid was a \"difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly\" adding: \"We will do everything we can...to rebuild a capability on development.\"",

      "In her resignation letter, Dodds said she welcomed an increase to defence spending at a time when the post-war global order had \"come crashing down\".",
      "She added that she understood some of the increase might have to be paid for by cuts to ODA [overseas development assistance].",
      "However, she expressed disappointment that instead of discussing \"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\", the prime minister had opted to allow the ODA to \"absorb the entire burden\".",
      "She said the cuts would \"likely lead to a UK pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations - at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence\".",
      "\"It will likely lead to withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank; the UK being shut out of numerous multilateral bodies; and a reduced voice for the UK in the G7, G20 and in climate negotiations.\"",
      "The spending cuts mean \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. The aid budget is already used to pay for hotels for asylum seekers in the UK, meaning the actual amount spend on aid overseas will be around 0.15% of gross national income.",
      "The prime minister's decision to increase defence spending came ahead of his meeting in Washington - the US president has been critical of European countries for not spending enough on defence and instead relying on American military support.",
      "He welcomed the UK's commitment to spend more, but Sir Keir has been attacked by international development charities and some of his own MPs for the move.",
      "Dodds held off her announcement until the prime minister's return from Washington, in order not to overshadow the crucial visit, and it was clear she did not want to make things difficult for the prime minister.",
      "But other MPs have been uneasy about the decision, including Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development committee, who said that cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that would \"only make the world less safe\".",
      "Labour MP Diane Abbott, who had been critical of the cuts earlier in the week, said it was \"shameful\" that other ministers had not resigned along with Dodds.",
      "Dodds's resignation also highlights that decisions the prime minister feels he has to take will be at odds with some of the views of Labour MPs, and those will add to tensions between the leadership and backbenchers.",

      "\"He may not be able to convince the ministers in his own cabinet, but on this subject, I will back him.\"",
      "However one of her backbenchers - and a former international development minister - Andrew Mitchell backed Dodds, accusing Labour of trying \"disgraceful and cynical actions\". \"Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Dodds had done \"the right thing\" and urged the government to find alternative ways to pay for increases to defence spending.",
      "He suggested raising money through increases to the digital services tax or setting up a European rearmament bank, which would lend money to governments to buy military equipment or the private sector to expand their manufacturing capacity.",
      "Sir Ed argued that if the UK cut back on overseas aid, China and Russia would \"fill the vacuum\".",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said she was \"sorry to hear\" of Dodds's resignation.",

      "Dodds first became a Labour MP in 2017 when she was elected to represent the Oxford East constituency.",
      "Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party she served as a shadow Treasury minister and was promoted to shadow chancellor when Sir Keir took over.",
      "Following Labour's poor performance in the 2021 local elections, she was demoted to the women and equalities brief.",

      "President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion.",
      "As far as the UK is concerned, it will not change Sir Keir Starmer's approach, but makes the issues he has been focusing on for the past few days more acute and more urgent.",
      "The prime minister still views his core tasks as finding a way to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together, and drawing up the foundations of a workable peace deal that can be presented to the US.",
      "As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum.",

      "But to be a bridge between both countries, Sir Keir will in time need evidence that he has influence on both sides of that bridge.",
      "Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid.",
      "He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong.",
      "We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days.",
      "But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not.",
      "It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do.",
      "Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister.",
      "Vance comments row",
      "As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administration's decision and how it will work.",
      "And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume.",
      "Or, this may be the clearest example that  - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different.",
      "Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's \"armed forces and border defences\" to ensure that \"Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself,\" according to the official conclusions of the summit.",

      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",

      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "It's unclear what, if any, role Donald Trump's administration may have played in their release, but one of Trump's top envoys is said to have raised the case with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at a security conference in Munich earlier this month.",
      "Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media.",
      "The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.",
      "They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".",
      "On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending.",
      "Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings.",
      "What is the White House saying?",
      "When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: \"I know nothing about that.\"",
      "But the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania.",
      "Romanian officials say US counterparts brought up the brothers' case with the Romanian government earlier this month, a story first reported by the Financial Times.",

      "He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate \"an extraordinary human being\" who was offering \"a dying West some hope for renewal\".",
      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.",
      "Trump Jr once called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\".",
      "Musk reinstated Andrew Tate's account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.",
      "Joseph McBride, a lawyer representing the Tates in a defamation case they have filed against several of their accusers in Florida, said in a statement: \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president.\"",

      "The 'manosphere'",
      "Trump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere \u2013 a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits.",
      "It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.",
      "The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.",
      "The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist \u2013 women-hating \u2013 and sexist views.",
      "On podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men.",
      "In extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape.",
      "Tate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms.",
      "He told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\"",

      "And support for the Tates is far from universal among Trump supporters and American conservatives, many of whom moved to immediately distance themselves from the brothers.",

    "story": [
      "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
      "A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"",
      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",
      "\"A lot better than where I was before.\"",
      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",
      "What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"",
      "As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.",

      "More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.",
      "Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.",
      "\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.",
      "It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.",
      "\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.",

      "\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"",
      "It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?",

      "\"The future of all icebergs is that they will die. It's very surprising to see that A23a has lasted this long and only lost about a quarter of its area,\" said Prof Huw Griffiths, speaking to BBC News from the Sir David Attenborough polar research ship currently in Antarctica.",
      "On Saturday the 300m tall ice colossus struck the shallow continental shelf about 50 miles (80km) from land and now appears to be firmly lodged.",
      "\"It's probably going to stay more or less where it is, until chunks break off,\" says Prof Andrew Meijers from British Antarctic Survey.",
      "It is showing advancing signs of decay. Once 3,900 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in size, it has been steadily shrinking, shedding huge amounts of water as it moves into warmer seas. It is now an estimated 3,234 sq km.",
      "\"Instead of a big, sheer pristine box of ice, you can see caverns under the edges,\" Prof Meijers says.",
      "Tides will now be lifting it up and down, and where it is touching the continental shelf, it will grind backwards and forwards, eroding the rock and ice.",
      "\"If the ice underneath is rotten - eroded by salt - it'll crumble away under stress and maybe drift somewhere more shallow,\" says Prof Meijers.",
      "But where the ice is touching the shelf, there are thousands of tiny creatures like coral, sea slugs and sponge.",
      "\"Their entire universe is being bulldozed by a massive slab of ice scraping along the sea floor,\" says Prof Griffiths.",

      "\"Where it is destroying something in one place, it's providing nutrients and food in other places,\" he adds.",
      "There had been fears for the islands' larger creatures. In 2004 an iceberg in a different area called the Ross Sea affected the breeding success of penguins, leading to a spike in deaths.",
      "But experts now think that most of South Georgia's birds and animals will escape that fate.",
      "Some Macaroni penguins that forage on the shelf where the iceberg is stuck could be affected, says Peter Fretwell at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "The iceberg melts freshwater into salt water, reducing the amount of food including krill (a small crustacean) that penguins eat.",
      "The birds could move to other feeding grounds, he explains, but that would put them in competition with other creatures.",
      "The ice could block harbours or disrupt sailing when the fishing season starts in April.",
      "\"This will be the most ice from an iceberg we will have ever dealt with in a fishing season, but we are well-prepared and resourced,\" says Andrew Newman from Argos Froyanes.",
      "But scientists working in Antarctica currently are also discovering the incredible contributions that icebergs make to ocean life.",
      "Prof Griffiths and Prof Johnston are working on the Sir David Attenborough ship collecting evidence of what their team believe is a huge flow of nutrients from ice in Antarctica across Earth.",

      "A sign that this nutrient release has started around A23a will be when vast phytoplankton blooms blossom around the iceberg. It would look like a vast green halo around the ice, visible from satellite pictures over the next weeks and months.",
      "The life cycle of icebergs is a natural process, but climate change is expected to create more icebergs as Antarctica warms and becomes more unstable.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:01:51 GMT",
    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "summary": "How a new atomic clock might be the way to tackle attacks on plane GPS systems",
    "story": [
      "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.",
      "The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".",
      "This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.",
      "The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.",
      "To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.",
      "Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.",
      "The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.",
      "With this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.",
      "The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.",
      "In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.",
      "A new way of measuring time",
      "The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.",
      "Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.",
      "\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.",
      "In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.",
      "The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.",
      "The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.",
      "But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.",
      "\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"",
      "The 'Time Lords'",
      "Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.",
      "GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.",
      "The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.",
      "When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.",
      "\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.",
      "Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"",
      "While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".",
      "By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.",
      "But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.",
      "Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".",
      "Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.",
      "GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.",
      "\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.",
      "\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".",
      "Atomic clocks in our pockets",
      "The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.",
      "This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.",
      "QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.",
      "That process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.",

      "But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.",
      "\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.",
      "\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"",
      "Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.",
      "Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?",
      "One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.",

      "Loro Parque, a marine zoo in Spain that wants to receive the killer whales from Marineland, told the BBC this week the current proposal was \"wholly unsuitable\" and that they were best positioned to care for them.",
      "Christoph Kiessling, vice-president of the facility in Tenerife, said whale sanctuaries were \"currently unable to meet the complex physiological, social and environmental needs\" of killer whales.",
      "Most designs involve cordoning off a bay and employing staff to ensure Wikie and Keijo - who were born in captivity and cannot be released into the wild - are properly fed and looked after.",
      "Kiessling did say such a solution might be possible if there was more extensive research and planning but \"such a process could take years, leaving the two Marineland [orcas] in a facility that is being wound down\".",
      "Campaigners point out that several orcas have died at Loro Parque in the last few years, including three between March 2021 and September 2022.",
      "Managers at the marine zoo said scientific examination of those orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria showed the deaths were unavoidable.",
      "They also fear Wikie might be used for breeding. Loro Parque announced in January that Morgan, the only female of the three orcas currently kept there, is pregnant.",
      "Katheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection, said Loro Parque was ultimately an entertainment business that used orcas to make money.",
      "She added: \"Morgan's pregnancy underlines the fact that Loro Parque could never be a suitable option for Wikie and Keijo and should be removed as an option.\"",
      "Marineland, who are still paying to look after the orcas, said a move to Loro Parque as soon as possible was in the best interests of the animals' welfare. They have asked the ecology ministry to approve the transfer.",
      "'The water is too warm for orcas'",
      "The whale sanctuary in Canada applied to the French government to take in the orcas last year but their bid was rejected in January.",
      "They were told the site they had selected in Nova Scotia was too far away and that the water there was too cold for Wikie and Keijo, who have spent their whole lives in southern France.",
      "Following Pannier-Runacher's proposal for a sanctuary in Europe, which she announced a fortnight ago in a video on Instagram, the directors of the rejected Canadian project criticised the idea of one being built in the Mediterranean.",
      "They wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland. These two orcas do not belong to the ecotypes seen in the Mediterranean.\"",
      "He added: \"The possibility of building a sanctuary for them in the Mediterranean is probably the worst of the possible options.\"",
      "The directors also said, unlike the European proposal, their sanctuary was ready to begin construction as the design had already been finalised.",
      "Other animal rights groups have been more welcoming of Pannier-Runacher's announcement, saying a European sanctuary would still be better for the orcas' welfare than life in another marine zoo.",
      "Sea Shepherd, a marine conservation society, replied to the minister on Instagram saying this was a chance to achieve what the zoo industry calls \"impossible\" - the building of an ocean sanctuary where captive orcas can enjoy the rest of their lives.",
      "Pannier-Runacher said in her video she was keenly aware of the strong feelings people had about where Wikie and Keijo should be rehomed.",
      "She did not rule out sending them to Loro Parque or other marine zoos, only that she would \"oppose any transfer to a site that is not suitable for accommodating\" orcas.",
      "Last November she blocked an application by Marineland to send the killer whales to a marine zoo in Japan, citing lower animal welfare regulations in the country.",
      "The 'Year of the Sea' is currently underway in France, a government initiative to raise awareness about the importance of the ocean, and Pannier-Runacher believes the creation of a European whale sanctuary would be a fitting testament to it.",

      "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.",
      "The decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.",
      "Hunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.",
      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",
      "\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon.",
      "\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.",
      "The beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England.",
      "It says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure.",
      "That's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.",
      "NFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\".",
      "\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"",
      "We met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",
      "Since then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.",
      "\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.",
      "\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"",
      "Along the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

      "Nearly 2,000 years after a young man died in the Vesuvius volcanic eruption, scientists have discovered that his brain was preserved when it turned to glass in an extremely hot cloud of ash.",
      "Researchers found the glass in 2020 and speculated that it was a fossilised brain but did not know how it had formed.",
      "The pea-sized chunks of black glass were found inside the skull of the victim, aged about 20, who died when the volcano erupted in 79 AD near modern-day Naples.",
      "Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.",
      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",
      "\"This is a unique finding,\" he said.",

      "But the company says it has been misjudged and that the mouse is an important tool on the path to restoring Earth's depleted nature.",
      "Colossal Biosciences says that the experiments with hairy mice was a step towards genetically modifying elephants to be hairy and better able to withstand the cold.",
      "Its stated goal is to create herds of what it calls mammoth-like creatures to live in the arctic tundra. The company says the creatures' grazing habits would encourage grasslands to flourish and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being released from melting permafrost.",

      "She adds that the firm has other research programmes running in parallel, such as studying embryo development and creating artificial wombs for the genetically modified elephants to grow in, and which the company says will ensure that they achieve their target of creating cold adapted elephants in a few years.",
      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",
      "The genetic tools it is developing in the meantime are already helping species at risk of extinction, she adds. These include developing a vaccine for elephants against a deadly virus; the creation of genetically modified marsupials in Australia known as quoll to be resistant to neurotoxins produced by the cane toad; and reintroducing genetic diversity in the pink pigeon in Mauritius.",
      "And Prof Shapiro says that elephants won't suffer. The team is developing techniques to screen only viable embryos, and she believes that they won't be treated as outcasts either.",

    "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.",
      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",
      "What is a cat qubit?",
      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",
      "Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.",
      "Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.",
      "The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.",
      "Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\".",
      "Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.",
      "Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:",
      "\"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\"",
      "\"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently \u2013 mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\"",

      "Pivot point",
      "Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?",
      "Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.",
      "She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough.",
      "All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\".",

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",

      "The US and Israel have rejected an Arab plan for the post-war reconstruction of the Gaza Strip that would allow the 2.1 million Palestinians living there to stay in place.",
      "The proposal, endorsed by Arab leaders at a summit in Cairo, is their alternative to President Donald Trump's idea for the US to take over Gaza and permanently resettle its population.",
      "The Palestinian Authority and Hamas welcomed the Arab plan, which calls for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed there.",
      "But both the White House and Israeli foreign ministry said it failed to address realities in Gaza and stood by Trump's vision.",

      "A statement endorsing the plan stressed \"the categorical rejection of any form of displacement of the Palestinian people\", describing such an idea as \"a gross violation of international law, a crime against humanity and ethnic cleansing\".",
      "The plan envisages reconstruction taking place over three phases and taking five years, during which some 1.5 million displaced Gazans would be moved into 200,000 prefabricated housing units and 60,000 repaired homes.",
      "In the first phase, which would last six months and cost $3bn, millions of tonnes of rubble and any unexploded ordnance would be cleared.",

    "summary": "A key meeting has begun to revive China's lagging economy, which is now facing a trade war with the US.",
    "story": [
      "China has set an economic growth target for this year of \"around 5%\" and pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy, which is now facing a trade war with the US.",
      "Its leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors.",
      "But the week-long gathering is closely watched for clues on Beijing's policy changes - and this year is more significant than most.",
      "President Xi Jinping had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment, before Donald Trump's new 10% levy on Chinese imports came into effect on Tuesday.",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "This follows the 10% tariff imposed in early February, taking the total US levy to 20%. And it hits what has been a rare bright spot for the Chinese economy: exports.",
      "Beijing hit back almost immediately on Tuesday, just as it did last month. It announced retaliatory action that included 10%-15% tariffs on certain agriculture imports from the US. This is key because China is the biggest market for these goods, such as American corn, wheat and soybeans.",
      "At the opening of this week's meeting, known as Two Sessions, China vowed to make domestic demand the \"main engine and anchor\" of its economic growth.",
      "Beijing was able to meet its 5% target for the last two years but growth was driven by strong exports, which resulted in a nearly trillion-dollar record trade surplus.",
      "Repeating that is going to be much harder this year.",
      "\"If the tariffs linger, Chinese exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China economics at Moody's Analytics.",
      "Beijing is going to have to rely more than ever on domestic spending to achieve 5% growth - but that has been one of its biggest challenges.",
      "The spending crunch",
      "On Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said consumption has been sluggish and pledged to \"vigorously boost\" household demand.",
      "\"Domestically, the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough.\"",
      "\"Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,\" Li said, as he noted the rise of protectionism around the world.",
      "Beijing has already rolled out schemes to encourage its people to spend more, including allowing them to trade in and replace consumer goods like kitchen appliances, cars, phones and electronic devices.",
      "The government now aims to put more money into ordinary Chinese people's pockets and help cut the country's reliance on exports and investment.",
      "Beijing's plans include issuing 1.3 trillion yuan ($179bn; \u00a3140bn) in special treasury bonds this year to help fund its stimulus measures. Local governments will also be allowed to increase the amount of money they borrow to 4.4 trillion yuan, up from 3.9 trillion yuan, according to the annual \"Work Report\".",
      "In a rare move, Beijing raised its fiscal deficit - the difference between the government's spending and revenue - by one percentage point to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the highest level in decades.",
      "The hike signals Beijing's commitment to increase spending to shore up growth. It has long sought to keep the deficit at or below 3% of GDP to demonstrate fiscal discipline.",
      "It also announced plans to create more than 12 million jobs in cities, setting a target for urban unemployment at around 5.5% for 2025. The figure stood at 5.1% last year.",
      "The government also pledged to provide more support to high-tech industries, restore stability in the property market, and expand elderly care programmes for its ageing population.",
      "Whether these measures will be enough to boost consumption is the key question.",
      "Harsh pandemic-era restrictions along with a prolonged real estate crisis and a government crackdown on tech and finance companies have fuelled pessimism among Chinese people. And a weak social safety net means savings have become especially crucial in case of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.",
      "But China's leadership is optimistic. CPCC spokesman Liu Jieyi told reporters ahead of the session that while the economy was facing challenges such as low demand, it was \"important to recognise that China's economic fundamentals are stable, there are many advantages, resilience is strong, and potential is significant\".",
      "'High quality' development",
      "Investment in what President Xi calls \"high-quality development\", which covers high-tech industries from renewables to artificial intelligence (AI), is also expected to be a major focus.",
      "The world's second-largest economy, China has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West.",
      "State media has already touted recent examples like DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics, both of which have caught global attention, as examples of China's \"technological progress\".",
      "The success of DeepSeek in particular saw an AI-driven stock rally, with analysts noting renewed interest in China among foreign investors.",
      "A commentary in the state-run Xinhua newspaper said \"China's new energy industries and overall green transition, driven by its cutting-edge technologies, will continue to be important growth drivers\".",
      "But the new US levies - which come on top of tariffs from Trump's first term - could  stymie these plans, not least because they could dampen investor sentiment.",
      "\"The chaos that tariffs leave in their wake is kryptonite for investment,\" Mr Murphy Cruise says. \"Tariffs are set to deliver a one-two punch to China's economy, landing blows to both exports and investment.\"",
      "Also on Wednesday, China announced a 7.2% increase in its national defence budget, the same rate of growth as last year.",

      "A British man detained in India for six years without trial over a high-profile corruption case must be released on bail, the Delhi High Court has ruled.",
      "Christian James Michel, an arms consultant, is accused of bribing Indian officials to win a multimillion-dollar helicopter contract for British-Italian defence company AgustaWestland. He denies the charge.",
      "He was extradited to India from the United Arab Emirates in 2018 and has been in custody ever since, in what a judge called an \"exceptional\" situation.",
      "The AgustaWestland controversy was one of several corruption cases linked to India's former ruling Congress party, some of which fizzled out eventually.",
      "In 2010 the Indian government signed a deal with AgustaWestland's parent company to purchase 12 helicopters.",
      "The alleged irregularities came to light when India's federal auditor reported that the government may have vastly overpaid for the $753m (\u00a3455m) deal, which was eventually scrapped in 2014.",
      "According to court documents, Mr Michel is alleged to have received around \u20ac42m ($44.7m, \u00a325m) for securing the contract. His lawyer has argued that there is no evidence to connect him with the alleged offence.",
      "India's financial crime fighting agency and domestic crime bureau have held separate investigations into Mr Michel.",
      "But both of those investigations have yet to be concluded and trials have yet to begin, leading to a \"prolonged incarceration\" of Mr Michel, the Delhi High Court noted.",
      "The judge said his six years in pre-trial custody was also \"alarmingly close\" to the maximum punishment of seven years' imprisonment for money laundering, which is one of the charges he faces.",
      "The court decided to grant him bail in one of the cases, after the Supreme Court did the same in another case on 18 February.",
      "This means that Mr Michel is now free to leave Delhi's high-security Tihar jail, but he cannot leave India as his passport has been seized.",
      "The deal for 12 three-engine AW-101 helicopters was signed in February 2010 after AgustaWestland beat off competition from US and Russian rivals.",
      "The aircraft were intended for an elite squadron of the Indian air force which ferries around the president, the prime minister and other VIPs.",
      "Only three of the helicopters were delivered to India before the deal was scrapped.",
      "Italian prosecutors suspected that kickbacks worth almost $67.6m were paid to Indian officials to secure the contract.",
      "Giuseppe Orsi, the former chief of AgustaWestland's parent company which at the time was called Finmeccanica, and Bruno Spagnolini, the former head of AgustaWestland, were tried in Italy on fraud and corruption charges.",
      "Both were acquitted in 2018. Indian officials have said their acquittals would have no bearing on the case in India.",
      "India's air force chief at the time of the deal was arrested for bribery in 2016, and later released on bail.",

      "The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely.",
      "The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well.",
      "Europe is scrambling to react effectively.",
      "There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday.",
      "It is a huge moment in European history.",
      "Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake \u2014 with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War.",
      "Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears \"not to care about the fate of Europe\", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany.",
      "But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving?",
      "Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for \"action not words\". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine\", with urgent, extra arms deliveries.",
      "Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities.",
      "Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold:",
      "First, to show Donald Trump that \u2014 in the words of the UK prime minister \u2014 Europe will now do the \"heavy lifting\" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer \"freeloading\" off the United States.",
      "But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms.",

      "Russia is watching too.",
      "The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable.",
      "Moscow has already gloated about the \"splits\" it sees in Western unity.",

      "Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that \u2014 at least in the short-to-medium term \u2014 Europe still needs the US.",
      "That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump.",
      "The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War.",
      "The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support.",
      "If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed \u2014 that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences.",
      "That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that \"coalition\". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe.",
      "Can Europe fill the gap now the US has paused military support for Ukraine?",
      "What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine",
      "But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as \"enablers\".",
      "Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia.",
      "But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces.",
      "Any European peacekeeping or \"reassurance\" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary.",
      "These enablers \"can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry\", as one European politician put it to me.",
      "This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible.",
      "\"Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,\" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me.",
      "We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday.",
      "\"Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation.",
      "\"Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind.\"",
      "Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence.",
      "On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it.",
      "Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future.",
      "Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine \u2013 and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little.",
      "As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that \"Europe is in an era of re-armament\".",
      "She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by:",
      "Using its joint budget more creatively",
      "Providing 150bn euros in loans to benefit the defence of the EU as a whole \u2014 so, for example, in air and missile defence, anti-drone systems, and military mobility",

      "Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future.",
      "Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence.",
      "In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities.",

      "He returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending.",
      "BBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims.",
      "Did Trump inherit an economic catastrophe?",
      "Trump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden.",
      "This is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.",
      "The International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.",
      "On rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\".",
      "Inflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.",
      "The 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.",
      "Inflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.",
      "Did Biden let egg prices get out of control?",
      "Trump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\".",
      "Prices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.",
      "Egg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.",
      "The USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (\u00a3780m) plan to help combat the issue.",
      "The outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it.",
      "The Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.",

      "However, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.",
      "US media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.",

      "There is no evidence for a figure this high.",
      "Encounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.",
      "It is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.",

      "It says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.",

      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Slotkin a \"rising star\" in the party last week as he announced her as the pick to provide the Democratic Party's rebuttal. He said she was \"great on both economic and national security\" topics.",

      "The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely.",
      "The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well.",
      "Europe is scrambling to react effectively.",
      "There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday.",
      "It is a huge moment in European history.",
      "Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake \u2014 with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War.",
      "Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears \"not to care about the fate of Europe\", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany.",
      "But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving?",
      "Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for \"action not words\". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine\", with urgent, extra arms deliveries.",
      "Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities.",
      "Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold:",
      "First, to show Donald Trump that \u2014 in the words of the UK prime minister \u2014 Europe will now do the \"heavy lifting\" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer \"freeloading\" off the United States.",
      "But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms.",
      "It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove.",
      "Russia is watching too.",
      "The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable.",
      "Moscow has already gloated about the \"splits\" it sees in Western unity.",
      "Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator.",
      "Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that \u2014 at least in the short-to-medium term \u2014 Europe still needs the US.",
      "That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump.",
      "The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War.",
      "The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support.",
      "If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed \u2014 that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences.",
      "That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that \"coalition\". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe.",
      "Can Europe fill the gap now the US has paused military support for Ukraine?",
      "What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine",
      "But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as \"enablers\".",
      "Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia.",
      "But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces.",
      "Any European peacekeeping or \"reassurance\" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary.",
      "These enablers \"can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry\", as one European politician put it to me.",
      "This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible.",
      "\"Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,\" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me.",
      "We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday.",
      "\"Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation.",
      "\"Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind.\"",
      "Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence.",
      "On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it.",
      "Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future.",
      "Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine \u2013 and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little.",
      "As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that \"Europe is in an era of re-armament\".",
      "She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by:",
      "Using its joint budget more creatively",
      "Providing 150bn euros in loans to benefit the defence of the EU as a whole \u2014 so, for example, in air and missile defence, anti-drone systems, and military mobility",
      "Suspending EU fiscal rules to allow individual EU countries to spend more on defence",
      "EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday \u2013 including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine.",
      "But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics.",
      "Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way.",
      "Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future.",
      "Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence.",
      "In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities.",
      "But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow.",
      "European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says.",
      "If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.",

    "summary": "There are efforts under way to recycle and reuse more at what has been dubbed \"the greatest show on Earth\".",
    "story": [
      "From dazzling costumes to exuberant parties, Trinidad's carnival is often dubbed \"the greatest show on Earth\".",
      "But some of its elements are not exactly eco-friendly and the festivities are estimated to produce 3.4 tonnes of waste every year according to Carnicycle, a local initiative aiming to make festivities more sustainable.",
      "Danii McLetchie, who co-founded Carnicycle in 2018, says that while carnival \"is a big part of our culture\" it also has a very negative environmental impact \"from the events, to the textiles, to costumes\" used by the masqueraders, spectators and vendors taking part in the annual parade on the two days preceding Ash Wednesday.",
      "Producing and transporting just a single carnival costume bra can generate approximately 37.68kg (83lb) of CO2 emissions, Carnicycle estimates based on calculations made using an online tool provided by Swedish tech company Doconomy.",
      "Danii and her team are working to have that estimate verified by a third party, but with tens of thousands of masqueraders parading every year, she says the amount of emissions is cause for concern.",
      "To reduce those emissions, Carnicycle has started a recycling programme, collecting unused costumes that would have been dumped or burned by masquerade bands, which use new costume designs every year.",
      "Carnicycle also puts up collection bins at hotels and other venues so discarded costumes can be reused.",
      "\"Up until last year we collected around 10,000 pieces of costume materials,\" Danii told the BBC, describing the arduous task of completely stripping down truckloads of costumes to preserve feathers, beads and other materials for future use.",
      "The salvaged materials are sold to costume designers, ravers, and people in the burlesque industry, who save by buying second hand.",
      "Carnicycle also rents out the large backpack pieces which are a popular part of the costumes worn at Trinidad's carnival. Their price can run up to $700 (\u00a3550), depending on size.",
      "Danii explains that they came up with the idea after hearing revellers complain not just about the expense but also about the weight of the backpack pieces. \"'I'm paying this much money but then it's heavy and by the time it's lunch I just want to throw it away',\" Danni recalls people saying.",
      "Carnicycle rents the backpacks to masqueraders long enough so that they can pose for photos, but are freed from carrying their load during the parade.",
      "Danii and Carnicycle's co-founder Luke Harris \u2013 who both hold down full-time jobs in addition to their environmental initiative - are not the only ones dedicating their spare time to making Trinidad's carnival both fun and eco-friendly",
      "Lawyer Aliyah Clarke and fashion designer Kaleen Sanois started a side business called 2nd Closet - a pop-up thrift shop where people can buy and sell pre-owned clothing.",
      "The two have also been making video tutorials with tips on how to transform costumes into beachwear and outfits for other occasions.",
      "Aliya told the BBC it was something she first did for herself: \"After I was finished with my costume I would rip it apart, literally down to the wire, and figure out how to make this into something else to wear outside of carnival.\"",
      "Now she is sharing her ideas in a video segment the two millennials have dubbed \"Tipsy Tuesday\".",
      "They also offer a closet-sorting service, which involves coming to a person's home and sorting through unwanted clothing, to rescue items fit for sale at their pop-up thrift shop.",
      "In what Kaleen believes is a testament to the work they have been doing, they were asked to sort the sprawling closet of Machel Montano, a musician known as the \"King of Soca\" and a superstar in the carnival world.",
      "\"Clothes are personal things, especially for somebody like Machel who has so many big moments tied to his pieces,\" Kaleen explains.",
      "After sorting through Machel's shoes and clothes, 2nd Closet organised a two-day pop-up shop, giving people a chance to buy items worn by Machel on stage and in his music videos.",
      "\"People came with pictures, and were like 'I'm looking for this piece',\" Aliyah recalls of fans' enthusiasm for the second-hand items.",
      "But costumes and outfits are not the only items being recycled to make Trinidad's festivities more environmentally friendly.",
      "At Fete with the Saints, a party many regard as one of the best of Trinidad's carnival, food is eaten with biodegradable wooden cutlery and the drinks are poured into reusable cups.",
      "The organisers of the fete -  a fundraiser for one of Trinidad and Tobago's top secondary schools \u2013 also hire \"bin detectives\" to ensure patrons properly sort and dispose their rubbish for recycling.",
      "It is estimated that this year the bin detectives helped to more than double the amount of recyclables captured, compared with the two previous years combined.",
      "\"Over the past three years we've actually prevented over one million single-use plastics from entering the landfill, I think maybe over five tonnes of glass,\" says Vandana Mangroo, co-founder of Close the Loop Caribbean, a company which started working with the organisers of Fete with the Saints in 2023 to make the event more sustainable.",
      "Joseph Hadad, co-chairman of the party's organising committee, says that those behind the event knew that their efforts to make it greener would \"add some layer of costs and more labour\". But he is adamant \"it worked\" and insists that the party spirit has not been dampened.",

    "story": [
      "Actor Ione Skye, known for her breakout role in the 1989 film \"Say Anything,\" is giving fans a look behind her glamorous but tumultuous Hollywood life in a new memoir titled \"Say Everything.\"",
      "In her memoir, the 54-year-old actress reflects on a journey that began when she was just 15, starring alongside Keanu Reeves in \"River's Edge\" before sharing the screen with River Phoenix, Matthew Perry and John Cusack in the films that would cement her status as a teen idol.",
      "\"When I look back on the pictures, I almost can't take in how young I look,\" Skye said.",
      "The memoir also details her relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis, which began when she was 16 and he was 24.",
      "\"I liked the idea of this dangerous dark prince of a rock n' roller,\" she writes, though her perspective has shifted with time.",
      "\"It shocks me. And I also feel bad for myself,\" Skye said. \"I'm happy I knew Anthony Kiedis and \u00a0[Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist] Flea, but I wish I'd met them ten years later and never dated them.\"",
      "Kiedis struggled with heroin addiction during their relationship. When asked why she stayed, Skye said: \"I thought I had to save him.\"",
      "The actress later married Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys at age 21, a relationship that lasted seven years before ending due to affairs Skye had with women. The end of this relationship in particular, Skye said, is difficult to look back on \u2013 even more than 25 years later.",
      "\"I discovered writing this book, it was very clear that I'm not good with grief. I'm not good with loss at all,\" she said. \"I still find it painful. I can't even listen to a Beastie Boys song. It feels like a death to me.\"",
      "She said she feels the pain comes from not only hurting a \"sweet person\" but also hurting herself.",
      "Much of Skye's memoir explores how her relationships were shaped by the absence of her father, Scottish singer Donovan Leitch, who left when she was born.",
      "\"Hearing his beautiful music was very painful sometimes because it's hard to see someone do beautiful art and think, 'Where is that for me?,\" she said.",
      "The book reveals a disturbing chapter when Leitch's attorney sent a letter requesting a paternity test when Skye was already a successful actress.",
      "\"I couldn't believe it,\" she said.",
      "Ultimately, Skye decided against taking the paternity test. Skye says she didn't meet her father until just before her 18th birthday.",
      "\"It was strange. I was really self-conscious in thinking we're touching right now for the first time and hugging,\" she recalled. \"The sad thing is I wanted more. Yeah, I just, and I still do. I wanted to just see him again.\"",
      "Skye would have another revelation when she was pregnant and splitting up with her fianc\u00e9, designer David Netto.",
      "\"I was in the shower, pregnant and sobbing because it was so stressful. And then I thought my mother probably was pregnant with me in a shower in 1969,\" she said. \"That's a very direct repeat of a pattern.\"",
      "Now living in Australia with her husband, musician Ben Lee, and their family, Skye says they share the same unique experience of early fame.",
      "\"Our careers were really big when we were teenagers and we've both had to deal with the ups and downs of keeping our careers going,\" she said.",
      "Five years ago, Skye took her family to visit her father and stepmother in Ireland, a trip she describes as healing. She also found connection with her father through her role in the film \"Zodiac,\" which featured one of his songs.",
      "Reflecting on completing her memoir, Skye called it \"an act of self-forgiveness.\"",
      "\"I felt very proud. I felt like I learned a lot about myself,\" she said. \"I felt like it's a bit of whiplash for a long time, but I do settle in a nice place.\"",

      "\"America demanded it and now it's happening: Taco Bell's new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I'm hosting the Oscars,\" O'Brien said in a statement when he was announced as host.",
      "O'Brien kept things moving in the broadcast and delivered some few comedic interludes, including a musical number in which he sang about not wasting the audience's time.",
      "The Oscars ceremony was broadcast on ABC on Sunday night from the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood, in Los Angeles. \"Anora\" went home with five awards, including best picture. See the full list of winners here.",
      "Who is Conan O'Brien?",
      "Conan O'Brien is best known for hosting the late-night talk shows \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" and \"Conan.\"",
      "O'Brien, now 61, spent nearly three decades as a late-night host. In 2015, he became the \"longest-working current late night talk show host\" in the U.S., following David Letterman's retirement, according to TBS.",
      "This was his first time as the Oscar host, but he has done the honors for other high-profile awards shows, including hosting the Emmys in 2002 and 2006.",
      "Before he became a well-known TV personality, O'Brien was a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons.\"",
      "Who hosted the Oscars in the past?",
      "O'Brien joined an illustrious list of Oscar hosts that includes the likes of Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal, David Letterman, Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Neil Patrick Harris.",
      "\"He joins an iconic roster of comedy greats who have served in this role, and we are so lucky to have him center stage for the Oscars,\" said Craig Erwich, president of the Disney Television Group, when O'Brien was named.",

      "That year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided against having a host for the first time in 30 years and didn't have an official host again until 2022, when Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes co-hosted the ceremony. That show, however, was overshadowed by\u00a0Will Smith slapping Chris Rock\u00a0in the face onstage over a joke Rock made about Smith's wife,\u00a0Jada Pinkett Smith.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-hollywood-has-changed-filmmaking-in-the-age-of-streaming/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:58:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:05:52 -0500",
    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

    "summary": "Many actors have launched their careers in horror movies. But two of our most acclaimed stars are now headlining a low-budget horror film: \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" about a psychopath terrorizing his fellow nursing home residents with a sinister doll puppet.",
    "story": [
      "It might be known as winter elsewhere, but in Hollywood, they call it \"awards season\" \u2026 and just about everyone's in town for tonight's grand finale. One of the stars of \"Conclave,\" John Lithgow, is looking forward to it. \"Yes, I haven't been to the Oscars in years.\"",
      "Lithgow says he really likes playing the bad guy.",
      "\"Everything you do seems like it's a lot of fun for you,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I try to find things that are fun,\" Lithgow said. \"I don't go looking for them. They come to me. By now, I'm on a short list of actors, who is well known for being ready, willing, and able to do just about anything. So, wild roles come my way. Nothing normal!\"",
      "Also in town: esteemed actor Geoffrey Rush. He might live Down Under, but he's picked up a few awards up here, including a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy, or as he puts it, \"a TOE.\"",
      "We got both Rush and Lithgow in the same room to talk about something they've done together. In \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" Rush plays a wheelchair-bound stroke patient recovering in a nursing home, and Lithgow is the merciless bully who terrorizes his fellow residents, often with a sinister doll puppet, named Jenny Pen.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" click on the video player below:",
      "If it looks like a low-budget horror film, that's because it is!",
      "\"Lot of times, this is how people get their start in the business \u2013 they do a low-budget horror movie,\" I said.",
      "\"This is where we ended up!\" said Rush.",
      "\"Geoffrey's just one of the great actors,\" said Lithgow. \"And you just read the script and said, 'This is a hell of a double act.'\"",
      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

    "story": [
      "The top communications official under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly resigned last week, just two weeks after being sworn in to be the department's assistant secretary for public affairs.",
      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not comment, when asked about Kennedy's remarks. Instead, Nixon re-sent a previous statement attributed to principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear about Kennedy making measles a \"top priority\" for his team.",
      "Spear is one of a handful of aides now at HHS to have worked for Kennedy during his longshot presidential campaign. Many others were hired from the ranks of Trump supporters and alumni of other federal agencies.",
      "This includes Nixon, who previously handled press for Trump's campaign. Nixon had reported to Corry alongside Michael Brady, a former top Army public affairs official.",
      "Corry previously served as a communications official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the COVID-19 pandemic, under the first Trump administration.",
      "Multiple current CMS officials praised Corry as highly competent, trusted and well-liked among career federal health officials, as well as by Trump aides.",
      "Spear, who also has the title of a senior counselor to Kennedy, has been tightly controlling communications across the department, multiple officials said.",
      "Before Kennedy's confirmation, Spear ordered the unprecedented department-wide communications \"pause\" that froze the release of information across HHS.",
      "Other factors have contributed to challenges within the communications shop, including a shortfall in staffing, a former HHS official said.",
      "During the Biden administration, when top-ranking civil servants within the communications office retired in recent years, they were replaced by political appointees, not career executives who would stay on after the White House changed hands.",
      "That complicated the transition and left the incoming Trump administration with a deficit of institutional knowledge.",
      "More changes could be coming soon to the communications officials who remain. A current HHS official said staff within the team were asked to provide explanations of their \"roles and responsibilities\" by noon on Tuesday.",

      "Other factors driving spread that were cited by PAHO include increased movement of people around the Americas and an uptick in dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection that can mask the spread of measles due to similar symptoms.",
      "What is measles elimination?",
      "The U.S. achieved measles elimination in 2000, after documenting a year of no endemic spread of the virus. WHO officials declared North and South America free of measles in 2016, making the Americas the first region to reach this milestone in the world.",
      "Health officials define \"measles elimination\" as proof of no endemic spread of the highly contagious virus within an area for at least 12 months. A continuous chain of transmission persisting for at least a year would reverse that goal.",
      "While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually reports hundreds of measles cases every year around the U.S., many are from short-lived outbreaks linked to unvaccinated young children who were recently outside the U.S.",
      "The last large outbreak of the virus in the U.S. was in Illinois last year. It was largely confined to migrant shelters in Chicago.",

It's used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman's immune system attacks her fetus' red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh-negative blood type and her baby's is Rh-positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors. They help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",

    "summary": "The cancelation upends the usual process to start manufacturing next winter's flu shots.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration unexpectedly canceled an annual meeting of its advisers to update next season's influenza vaccines, an adviser on the panel and multiple officials tell CBS News, upending the usual process to start manufacturing next winter's flu shots.",
      "\"We're all left trying to understand what is going on. Why was this meeting canceled? It's an important meeting. What's the plan for flu vaccines this year,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News.",
      "Offit said he received the notification that the meeting was canceled shortly after 4 p.m. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee was supposed to meet on March 13 to discuss how to update the shots for the next flu season, Offit said.",
      "Some of the other committee members said they had not received any notification about the upcoming meeting being canceled. Offit said the email he received was addressed to all of the committee's members.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Thursday that the meeting had been canceled.",
      "\"The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,\" the spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "It is possible for the FDA to make the pick for flu shots without consulting the panel, a former federal health official said, though it would be unprecedented in recent history.",
      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "\"Because the vaccine is grown in eggs, for the most part, it requires six months to produce. So March is six months before September, which is when these vaccines roll out,\" said Offit.",
      "Last year, the FDA asked the committee to meet on March 5 to decide on how to update the influenza shots for the 2024 to 2025 season.",
      "The agency usually announces these meeting dates around a month in advance. Next month's meeting had not yet been publicly disclosed.",
      "Which strains are picked to be targeted by the vaccines can have a significant impact on how effective the shots are.",
      "Early data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's testing suggests that this past season's vaccine may have been a poor match for one of the common strains of the virus. More data on the effectiveness of the vaccine is expected to be released Thursday.",
      "The cancellation is just the latest federal vaccine meeting to be disrupted.",
      "A quarterly meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was unexpectedly postponed earlier this month, citing the need \"to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 13:15:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Overall effectiveness against flu hospitalization was still high, the CDC said.",
    "story": [
      "This season's influenza vaccines may have been less effective against emergency room visits for some kids compared to last year, a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests, though effectiveness was still high against hospitalization.",
      "So far this season, the vaccine's protection against flu hospitalization was at least 63% for children and at least 41% for adults. These estimates of effectiveness against hospitalization, released Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, are considered high for flu vaccines.",
      "But another metric of the shot's effectiveness, looking at protection against infections that result in outpatient visits to places like urgent care clinics or emergency rooms, was worse. Effectiveness was 32% for children and adolescents, from the CDC's U.S. Flu VE network of health care systems. That's down from 67% in last year's estimates.",
      "Those figures are lower than from another network of outpatient providers in the report. The study's authors suspect the decline is because of a difference in how many kids were infected in each by a strain of the flu virus called H3N2.",
      "\"The U.S. Flu VE network did not find statistically significant VE against influenza A(H3N2) in the outpatient setting among child and adolescent patients or among adult patients,\" the study's authors wrote.",
      "Earlier data reported by the CDC suggested that this season's flu vaccines might be poorly matched against many H3N2 strains this season. Around half of infections this past fall and winter were H3N2.",
      "Scientists say that the protection offered by flu shots varies widely based on several drivers, not just how well-matched the shots are to what strains are circulating. A major factor is what kind of immunity people have from previous infections and vaccinations.",
      "Estimates for effectiveness in adults from the same network was 36%. That is similar to the 33% at this time last year.",
      "The new data comes as the U.S. is now seeing signs of a slowdown in influenza, after a record wave that reached some of the worst levels since the 2009 swine flu pandemic.",

      "The predominant symptoms reported are diarrhea and vomiting, the Vessel Sanitation Program said. The ship's crew increased cleaning and disinfection procedures, isolated ill passengers and crew members, and collected stool specimens for testing, the program said. The crew will stay in contact with the Vessel Sanitation Program to consult on sanitation procedures and report any additional illnesses.",
      "\"During its current voyage, a number of guests onboard Eurodam reported symptoms of gastrointestinal illness. The cases were mostly mild and quickly resolved,\" a Holland America Line spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"We initiated enhanced sanitation protocols in conjunction with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to minimize further transmission, including continuous disinfection of the ship.\"",
      "Norovirus is a very contagious illness that causes vomiting and diarrhea. Most people who are sickened with it report feeling better in one to three days, but remain contagious for a few days afterward, according to the CDC. In addition to vomiting and diarrhea, patients may experience nausea, stomach pain, fever, headaches and body aches. Patients may also become dehydrated.",

Another outbreak on the Viking Ocean Cruises ship Viking Mars affected 62 passengers and nine crew members. The first norovirus outbreak investigated by the Vessel Sanitation Program this year was aboard another Holland America Line ship.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-stock-market-impact-on-your-401k-plan/",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 15:07:37 -0500",
    "summary": "The stock market has swung wildly since President Trump placed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Here's what to know about your 401(k).",
    "story": [
      "During his Tuesday night address\u00a0to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause \"a little disturbance.\" But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings.",
      "The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",
      "\"And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success,\" he added. \"They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market.\"",

      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "The goal is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",

      "In a press release, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings, in a deal valued at $22.8 billion. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing.",
      "\"This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP's combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth,\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a joint announcement with TilL of the deal. \"Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \"give China ready observation posts\" to take action. \"This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\" Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",

      "With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal \u2014 a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans \u2014 is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",
      "The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China.",

      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",

And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",

      "What is the average Social Security retroactive payment?",
      "The retroactive payments are due to the law's elimination of two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",

      "Products imported directly from Canada, Mexico and China could see price hikes as businesses pass along the tariff costs, either in full or in part, to consumers.

      "Vegetables, fruit, beef, beer and spirits",

Fresh produce prices could increase by about 3%, while food prices overall may increase by 2%, according to a new analysis from Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee.",
      "According to the\u00a0Atlanta Fed, the tariffs on three key U.S. trading partners would bring up prices on everyday purchases, including food and beverages, by as much as 1.63%, if businesses pass along anywhere from half to all of the added costs to consumers.",

      "\"I don't think China will buy any more U.S. farm products. The orders will go to South America,\" Lun said. \"I think all in all, it's a lose-lose situation. Nobody gains anything.\"",
      "Anxiety over tariffs is also bleeding into the corporate side of the economic equation. Target reported Tuesday that sales and profit in the crucial holiday quarter both fell from a year ago, though they were better than expected. The Minnesota retailer said there will be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs.",
      "Shares of Target and Best Buy fell after the retailers warned of pressure on sales and higher prices for consumers. Target shares tumbled $3.62, or 3.0%, to $117.14.",
      "Many had hoped Mr. Trump would choose a less painful path on global trade. Monday's loss shaved the S&P 500's gain since Election Day down to just over 1% from a peak of more than 6%. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies from Mr. Trump that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses.",
      "After the S&P 500 set a record  last month following a parade of fatter-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies, the market began diving following weaker-than-expected reports  on the U.S. economy, including a couple showing U.S. households are getting much more pessimistic  about inflation because of the threat of tariffs. Such pessimism is not unwarranted, according to analysts.",
      "\"Inflation is set to surge as the cost of everyday goods rises, squeezing corporate margins and reshaping supply chains across industries,\" warns Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm\u00a0deVere Group which forecasts that inflation in the US could rise by as much as 2.1%, \"putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to maintain a more hawkish stance for longer than markets had anticipated,\" as a result of tariffs.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",

      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",

      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

    "story": [
      "A recent Harvard Business Review\u00a0article identified a phenomenon called \"meeting hangovers\" which new research shows can derail productivity well beyond the meeting itself.",
      "A survey conducted by University of North Carolina Charlotte and other institutions found that more than 90% of employees occasionally experience these \"meeting hangovers,\" with over half reporting that these negative effects hurt their overall workflow and productivity.",
      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",
      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

      "\"The circumstances of your appointment raise questions about the truthfulness of President Trump's assertion that 'Social Security will not be touched [by DOGE],'\" Warren wrote in the letter.

    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",

      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Mr. Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 16:19:37 -0500",
    "summary": "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\"one Social Security Administration employee said of the agency's plans to slash its workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security Administration workers are warning that the Trump administration's plan to significantly shrink the agency could cause chaos and hinder their ability to provide service to the millions of retirees, disabled people and other Americans who rely on the program.",
      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",
      "Americans fund the Social Security Administration's services through their payroll taxes, or FICA contributions, noted Rich Couture, the spokesman for the Social Security General Committee of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "\"The public paid for access to services with their FICA contributions,\" Couture said. \"We're at a 50-year staffing low in the midst of a customer service crisis \u2014 now is the time for us to invest in Social Security with proper staffing to make further improvements.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 15:45:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The man who launched the Economic Blackout said he is \"trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians,  to stand for the people.\"",
    "story": [
      "After years of railing against corporate greed on social media, John Schwarz had an idea that suddenly caught fire: an \"economic blackout\" aimed at resisting what he maintains is an alliance between corporations and politicians to rig the system against ordinary Americans.",
      "The 57-year-old Chicago resident, founder of the People's Union USA, the fledgling advocacy group leading the campaign, expresses surprise at suddenly finding himself and his movement in the spotlight. Yet while he initially found the attention overwhelming, Schwarz said that in other ways it's a moment he's been preparing for all of his life.",
      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",
      "What's the point of the boycotts?",
      "Schwarz doesn't expect the Economic Blackout to change things for the better overnight but he does think it will send corporations a message.",
      "\"We want companies to bend the knee \u2014 we've been kissing the ring our entire lives. It's time to turn that around,\" he said, adding \"We're the consumers. We are the economy. Without us, they're nothing.\"",
      "Schwarz said messages of support for the Economic Blackout have also been pouring in from people outside of the U.S. \"It's gone international, from Australia to Spain. Every country has messaged me, people from all over the world commenting on the videos. 'How can we stand in solidarity?'\"",
      "\"I just started telling them, you too, in your country, don't buy anything that day,\" he added.",
      "The Feb. 28 blackout began at 12 a.m. EST Friday and is scheduled to go on until 11:59 p.m. the same day. For the boycott, the People's Union is asking participants to refrain from making purchases, which includes avoiding fast food or filling their gas tanks. It adds that shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support local small businesses and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "The group plans to hold a second broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing targeted boycotts against specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",

      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:40:40 -0500",
    "summary": "IRS data shows that the average refund check so far is about $2,200, or $1,000 less than a year earlier. Here's what experts say.",
    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said.

      "In recent years, funding the government has created a headache for Johnson and his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, because of the narrow GOP majority in the House and opposition to temporary funding measures by a group of conservative hardliners. The dynamic has repeatedly forced Republicans to rely on Democrats to keep the government funded, fueling frustration among members of the House GOP ranks.",
      "But Democrats, now in the minority in both chambers and with few opportunities for leverage, are in a different position. As the Trump administration works to dramatically and quickly downsize large swaths of the executive branch, Democrats have been seeking guardrails on Mr. Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress and are intent on including language in the funding measure. Without the guardrails, Democrats argue that the stopgap measure would give the administration more opportunities to cut federal programs.",
      "Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he thinks what Democrats are requesting is \"unconstitutional,\" saying \"this should be a conversation about numbers, and not about limiting the other branch of government.\"",
      "Without support from Democrats, House Republicans must keep their conference in line to approve the stopgap measure. Johnson has touted the approach in recent days, which he billed as one that would keep the government open while House Republicans work to incorporate savings from the DOGE effort and revenue brought in by Trump administration policies. He noted on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that the DOGE cuts wouldn't be included in the forthcoming continuing resolution, while promising a \"very different process\" on next year's funding.",
      "During the last funding fight in December, Johnson pushed for an extension until March to set Republicans up to reach an agreement on new spending bills with a GOP trifecta in Washington. And he noted at the time that House Republicans were aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline. But the existing dynamics have persisted, even with Republican majorities in both chambers.",
      "Amid the standoff and approaching deadline, Republicans and Democrats have begun blaming each other. While Republicans say Democrats are flirting with a shutdown with their demands, Democrats argue that the GOP majorities would be responsible for any possible shutdown, and they claim Republicans have left the negotiating table.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that she's urging Republican leadership to work on new, full-year funding bills and prevent a shutdown with a shorter continuing resolution. She stressed that Democrats \"cannot stand by and accept\" what she called a \"power grab CR that would help Elon take a chainsaw to programs that families rely on.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to pass a short-term CR immediately to take down the risk of a shutdown so that we can finish our negotiations and write our full-year spending bills, which is our job to do,\" Murray added.",
      "Even if House Republicans can approve the six-month funding measure along party lines, a 60-vote threshold in the Senate means the measure would require the backing of at least seven Democrats to be approved in the upper chamber. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, who has said \"Republicans are responsible for funding the government,\" called for collaboration on a solution.",
      "\"We believe, we've always believed, the only solution is a bipartisan solution,\" Schumer said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump, in his 2025 address to the joint session of Congress, on March 4, 2025, sought to highlight the\u00a0accomplishments\u00a0of the opening weeks of his second administration. Over an hour and 40 minutes, the longest address of its kind, Mr. Trump spoke of his efforts to contain illegal immigration, the executive orders he has signed and his vision for how Congress should enact his sweeping legislative agenda. He also praised the work of Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency task force, or DOGE, for the drastic cuts they have enacted across the executive branch.",
      "Read the full text of his prepared remarks:",
      "Speaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the first lady of the United States, members of the United States Congress, thank you very much and to my fellow citizens: America is back. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years, 8 years \u2014 and we are just getting started. I return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back. And the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.",
      "The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again. Never been anything like it. The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an Electoral College victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.",
      "Now, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction \u2014 in fact it's an astonishing record, 27-point swing \u2014 the most ever. Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, a 41-point jump. Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive Orders and taken more than 400 Executive Actions, a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it. In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, it's our presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation. By many.",
      "And what makes it even more impressive, is that you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? I don't know about that list but we'll take it. Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they've done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way.",
      "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?",
      "This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what, five, five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.",
      "So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let's work together and let's truly make America great again. Every day my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future America deserves and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action.",
      "Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization, and I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council. We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction. To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.",
      "We ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job. We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me. How did that work out? Not too good, not too good. And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America, it's back. And two days ago I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America.",
      "I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again. Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska. We've ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.",
      "We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. You should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you, thank you very much. We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.",
      "I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding.",
      "And if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours. It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer.",
      "What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now because of us sweeping the entire world, common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, never going to let that happen. Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they've never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they're not sure. As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.",
      "Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg prices out of control. And we are working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that, you inherited a total mess from that administration. Do a good job. A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now. And frankly, we have never seen anything like it.",
      "That's why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency. As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.",
      "My administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. It's never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go. The permitting has gotten and later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.",
      "To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "And to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you've heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you're working very hard. He didn't need this, he didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it I believe. They just don't want to admit that.",
      "Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens, $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma, $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender.",
      "This is real. $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab \"Sesame Street\" in the Middle East, it's a program, $20 million for program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee \u2014 headed up and we know she's involved just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City, real estate developers done very well. $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia, $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda, $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we're doing? Should use it ourselves. A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. The most ever paid, nothing even like it. Under the Trump administration, all of these scams and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them, they're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.",
      "And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on.",
      "Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You're going to find it. But a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country, 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.",
      "Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229, one person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age \u2014 more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. But we're going to find out where that money is going, and it's not going to be pretty, by slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft. And theft we can find. We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.",
      "And today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It's about time. And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years \u2014 balance the federal budget, we're gonna balance it.",
      "With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out. Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.",
      "So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people. They're going to pay a lot of money, and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.",
      "Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America's potential in every possible way. The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead, take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again. Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately.",
      "Because we are draining the swamp, it's very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there, they're waiting for you to vote. And I'm sure that the people on my right \u2014 I don't mean the Republican right, but my right, right here \u2014 I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut. A very, very big part of our plan, we had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.",
      "And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. Oh, and by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made like never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it? That that along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today. All three, the top people and they're so excited. In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world. And this has taken place since a great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025.",
      "And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term. And if you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea.",
      "But that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. That's what one day would cost us, a lot of money, but we're going to do it in April. I'm a very superstitious person. April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.",
      "If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. It's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in that market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because there was so much money. They couldn't do anything about it. We've been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.",
      "They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico, have hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States, will not be doing that any longer. We're not going to do it any longer.",
      "Thanks to our America First policies we're putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies that people love. SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me, said, I cannot spend it fast enough, it's got to be much higher than that. I believe they'll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world's most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount \u2014 97% of the market \u2014 announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the U.S.A. And we're not giving them any money.",
      "Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. All that meant to them. We're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they're building. And many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money, we just want to protect our businesses and our people, and they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.",
      "A new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. I love the farmer. We'll now be selling it to our home market in the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.",
      "The tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period, we had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said, just bear with me. And they did, they did. You really have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great. But Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers. But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you too.",
      "And I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel because if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly we just won't have a country very long. Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.",
      "They're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much. No you're not, oh. And look, look where Biden took us, it's very low, the lowest we've ever been.",
      "Jeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, her very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States. Melania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce.",
      "Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive. Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Ladies Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education, become a teacher. And Allison Berry, who became a victim of an illicit, deepfake image produced by a peer. With Allison's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.",
      "And thank you to John Thune and the Senate. Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. Just terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind. There's nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody. That's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.",
      "But if we truly care about protecting America's children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies. They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast. And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you, and Paul and Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they've all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.",
      "Last year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken's beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.",
      "Last year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. Very strong, powerful act. It's called the Laken Riley Act. So, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. Thank you very much.",
      "Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history. And we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you. The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. Joe Biden didn't just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed. Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.",
      "Here tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis' 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.",
      "The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.",
      "Alexis. Moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that's not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or, if they are too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country because we don't want them to come back ever.",
      "With us this evening is a warrior on the frontline of that battle. Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz, great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. Doesn't sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed to great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. We honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman. The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation. posing a grave threat to our national security.",
      "The cartels are waging war in America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels. Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. But we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the U.S.A. They're going to stop it.",
      "I have sent Congress a detailed funding request, laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history. Larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you're going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast you won't even believe it.",
      "And as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.",
      "Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. Starting at the FBI and the DOJ, Pam. Good luck. Kash, wherever you may be. Good luck, good luck. Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Gonna to do a great job. Kash. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Kash.",
      "They have already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're going to be very proud of them. We're also once again giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they show dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job. But we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.",
      "This also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers. So I have no choice.",
      "One year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. A vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests -- and they were rough arrests, too. He was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests, and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them. I attended Officer Tiller's service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow's name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Thank you very much Stephanie. Thank you very much.",
      "Stephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero. New York's finest. And we're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we're going to do it fast. Gotta stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats. We got to get him out of here.",
      "I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And tonight, I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.",
      "I'm also asking for a new crime bill getting tougher on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don't want to be killed. We're not going to let them be killed.",
      "Joining us to the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is D.J. Daniel. He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. But in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. And D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. Actually, a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight, D.J., we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States secret Service. Thank you, D.J.",
      "D.J.'s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again, chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. With a name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.",
      "Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago \u2014 and you can't even believe these numbers \u2014 one in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it's one in 36. There's something wrong. One in 36. Think of that. So, we're going to find out what it is, and there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby. Good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you.",
      "My administration is also working to protect children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging their daughter to use a new name and pronouns--they/them pronouns, actually \u2014 or without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you. Thank you.",
      "Stories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology. I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth. And now, I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie. And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.",
      "Because we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it's already out, and it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don't we? Don't we feel better? Our service members won't be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country and Pete, congratulations, secretary of defense. And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.",
      "I am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference. And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results.",
      "And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results just about that we've ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see. People love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.",
      "We're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, when he was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete \u2014 a really good athlete, they say. A brilliant student with a 4.46 \u2014 that's good \u2014 GPA and his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",
      "And Jason, that's a very big deal getting in. That's a hard one to get into. But I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You'll soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.",
      "Thank you. Jason, you're going to be on the Long Gray Line, Jason. As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state of the art \"golden dome\" missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A.",
      "Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn't there. Not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually.",
      "And other place \u2014 they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right? Kim. Right. They should have it too. So I want to thank you, but it's a very, very important. This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we're going to protect our citizens like never before.",
      "To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.",
      "We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.",
      "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.",
      "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.",
      "But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work.",
      "They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's history if you bring it up to modern-day costs. It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely.",
      "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.",
      "Now we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Marco has been amazing, and he's going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman. And I feel very certain, so let's assume we got 100 votes. And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it.",
      "But he's already proven \u2014 I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you. He's doing a great job. Great job.",
      "And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.",
      "We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security. And I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.",
      "We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.",
      "It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.",
      "America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.",
      "Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.",
      "Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.",
      "And I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly, over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.",
      "What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.",
      "I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. It's happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.",
      "In the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords. And now we're going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.",
      "A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven't been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. A rough neighborhood actually.",
      "I'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight.",
      "The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense, with no security, with no way. Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say, \"Pocahontas says yes.\"",
      "2000 people are being killed every single week. More than that. They are Russian young people. They're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans. But I want it to stop.",
      "Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending.",
      "And we've spent perhaps $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby. That's what happened. And they've spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us. And they don't. But we're getting along very well with them. And lots of good things are happening.",
      "Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let's equalize. You got to be equal to us. That didn't happen.",
      "Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The letter reads: 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" he said. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\"",
      "I appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, we've had serious discussion with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.",
      "Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful?",
      "It's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end this senseless war.",
      "If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.",
      "Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years at a penal colony. Rough stuff. The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin.",
      "But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that. And they are here tonight.",
      "To Mark and his great mom: We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.",
      "As fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally.",
      "That was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did that, did I? Never forgot.",
      "Less than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.",
      "My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector. When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs. Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors- \u2014 we thought they were gone and they were saved \u2014 so those doctors had great talent. We're joined by Corey's wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. Thank you.",
      "To Helen, Allison and Kaylee: Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on. Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot. It was love like Corey's that built our country and it's love like Corey's that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before.",
      "I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that. Thank you very much.",
      "From the patriots of Lexington and Concord, to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware, to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk, to the astronauts who touched the moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.",
      "As we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people. Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it 'til death. We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.",
      "Our ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel. We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.",
      "Now it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era. With God's help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.",
      "We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars, and even far beyond.",
      "And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.",

    "summary": "Read the full text of Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin's prepared remarks for her 2025 Democratic response to Trump's speech to Congress, as released.",
    "story": [
      "Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin in her brief Democratic response to President Trump's joint address to Congress warned that Mr. Trump, in the his first few weeks of his second presidential term, has taken \"reckless\" approaches to managing the U.S. economy and foreign affairs.",
      "Here's the full text of her remarks, which ran just 10 minutes, compared to Mr. Trump's speech, which was an hour and 40 minutes long:",
      "Hi everyone. I'm Elissa Slotkin. I'm honored to have the opportunity to speak tonight. It's late \u2014 so I promise to be a lot shorter than what you just watched.",
      "I won't take it personally if you've never heard of me. I'm the new senator from the great state of Michigan, where I grew up. I've been in public service my entire life, because I happened to be in New York City on 9/11 when the twin towers came down. Before the smoke cleared, I knew I wanted a life in national security.",
      "I was recruited by the CIA and did three tours in Iraq, alongside the military. In between, I worked at the White House under President Bush and President Obama, two very different leaders who both believed that America is exceptional.",
      "You can find that same sense of patriotism here in Wyandotte, Michigan, where I am tonight. It's a working-class town just south of Detroit. President Trump and I both won here in November. It might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist all across the United States \u2013 places where people believe that if you work hard, and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids do better.",
      "It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat. But it was never a big deal. Because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party.",
      "We just went through another fraught election season. Americans made it clear that prices are too high and that government needs to be more responsive to their needs. America wants change. But there is a responsible way to make change, and a reckless way. And, we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country, and as a democracy.",
      "So that's what I'm going to lay out tonight.",
      "Because whether you're in Wyandotte or Wichita, most Americans share three core beliefs: That the Middle Class is the engine of our country. That strong national security protects us from harm. And that our democracy, no matter how messy, is unparalleled and worth fighting for.",
      "Let's start with the economy.",
      "Michigan literally invented the Middle Class: the revolutionary idea that you could work at an auto plant and afford the car you were building. That's the American Dream. And in order to expand and protect the Middle Class, we have to do a few, basic things:",
      "We need to bring down the price of things we spend the most money on: Groceries. Housing. Healthcare. Your car.",
      "We need to make more things in America with good-paying, union jobs \u2014 and bring our supply chains back home from places like China.",
      "We need to give American businesses the certainty they need to invest and create the jobs of the future.",
      "And we need a tax system that's fair for people who don't happen to make a billion dollars.",
      "Look, President Trump talked a big game on the economy, but it's always important to read the fine print. So: do his plans actually help Americans get ahead?",
      "Not even close.",
      "President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America. And to do that, he's going to make you pay in every part of your life.",
      "Grocery and home prices are going up, not down \u2014 and he hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either.",
      "His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber, cars \u2014 and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers.",
      "Your premiums and prescriptions will cost more because the math on his proposals doesn't work without going after your health care.",
      "Meanwhile, for those keeping score, the national debt is going up, not down. And if he's not careful, he could walk us right into a recession.",
      "And one more thing: In order to pay for his plan, he could very well come after your retirement \u2013 the Social Security, Medicare, and VA benefits you worked your whole life to earn. The President claims he won't, but Elon Musk just called Social Security \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\"",
      "While we're on the subject of Elon Musk, is there anyone in America who is comfortable with him and his gang of 20-year-olds using their own computer servers to poke through your tax returns, your health information, and your bank accounts? No oversight. No protections against cyber-attack. No guardrails on what they do with your private data.",
      "We need more efficient government. You want to cut waste, I'll help you do it. But change doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe.",
      "The mindless firing of people who work to protect our nuclear weapons, keep our planes from crashing, and conduct the research that finds the cure for cancer \u2014 only to re-hire them two days later? No CEO in America could do that without being summarily fired.",
      "OK, so we've talked about our economic security. How about national security?",
      "Let's start with the border. As someone who spent my whole career protecting our homeland, every country deserves to know who and what is coming across its border. Period. Democrats and Republicans should all be for that.",
      "But securing the border without actually fixing our broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom not the disease. America is a nation of immigrants. We need a functional system, keyed to the needs of our economy, that allows vetted people to come and work here legally. So I look forward to the President's plan on that.",
      "Because here's the thing: Today's world is deeply interconnected. Migration, cyber threats, AI, environmental destruction, terrorism \u2014 one nation cannot face these issues alone. We need friends in all corners \u2014 and our safety depends on it.",
      "President Trump loves to promise \"peace through strength.\" That's actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling over in his grave. We all want an end to the war in Ukraine, but Reagan understood that true strength required America to combine our military and economic might with moral clarity.",
      "And that scene in the Oval Office wasn't just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump's whole approach to the world. He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends, like Canada, in the teeth. He sees American leadership as merely a series of real estate transactions.",
      "As a Cold War kid, I'm thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s. Trump would have lost us the Cold War.",
      "Donald Trump's actions suggest that, in his heart, he doesn't believe we are an exceptional nation. He clearly doesn't think we should lead the world.",
      "Look, America's not perfect. But I stand with most Americans who believe we are still exceptional. Unparalleled. And I would rather have American leadership over Chinese or Russian leadership any day of the week.",
      "Because for generations, America has offered something better.",
      "Our security and our prosperity, yes. But our democracy, our very system of government, has been the aspiration of the world. And right now, it's at risk.",
      "It's at risk when a president decides he can pick and choose what rules he wants to follow, when he ignores court orders or the Constitution itself, or when elected leaders stand idly by and just let it happen.",
      "But it's also at risk when the President pits Americans against each other, when he demonizes those who are different, and tells certain people they shouldn't be included.",
      "Because America is not just a patch of land between two oceans. We are more than that. Generations have fought and died to secure the fundamental rights that define us. Those rights and the fight for them make us who we are.",
      "We are a nation of strivers. Risk-takers. Innovators. And we are never satisfied.",
      "That is America's superpower.",
      "And look, I've lived and worked in many countries. I've seen democracies flicker out. I've seen what life is like when a government is rigged. You can't open a business without paying off a corrupt official. You can't criticize the guys in charge without getting a knock at the door in the middle of the night.",
      "So as much as we need to make our government more responsive to our lives today, don't for one moment fool yourself that democracy isn't precious and worth saving.",
      "But how do we actually do that? I know a lot of you have been asking that question.",
      "First, don't tune out. It's easy to be exhausted, but America needs you now more than ever. If previous generations had not fought for democracy, where would we be today?",
      "Second, hold your elected officials, including me, accountable. Watch how they're voting. Go to town halls and demand they take action. That's as American as apple pie.",
      "Three, organize. Pick just one issue you're passionate about \u2014 and engage. And doom scrolling doesn't count. Join a group that cares about your issue, and act. And if you can't find one, start one.",
      "Some of the most important movements in our history have come from the bottom up.",
      "In closing, we all know that our country is going through something right now. We're not sure what the next day is going to hold, let alone the next decade.",
      "But this isn't the first time we've experienced significant and tumultuous change as a country. I'm a student of history, and we've gone through periods of political instability before. And ultimately, we've chosen to keep changing this country for the better.",
      "But every single time, we've only gotten through those moments because of two things: Engaged citizens and principled leaders.",
      "Engaged citizens who do a little bit more than they're used to doing to fight for the things they care about. And principled leaders who are ready to receive the ball and do something about it.",
      "So thank you tonight for caring about your country. Just by watching, you qualify as engaged citizens. And I promise that I, and my fellow Democrats, will do everything in our power to be the principled leaders that you deserve.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to halt a lower court order that required the Trump administration to unfreeze nearly $2 billion in foreign-aid funding, clearing the way for the money to flow to groups that have done work for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development overseas.",
      "The decision from the high court ends a pause Chief Justice John Roberts issued last week to allow the high court time to more fully consider a request from the Trump administration to intervene in the ongoing court battle over a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funds.",
      "The chief justice issued a brief administrative last Wednesday \u2014 with a midnight deadline for foreign aid payments approaching \u2014 before the full court acted on President Trump's bid for emergency relief.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in denying the request from the Trump administration, with Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining with the three liberal justices. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissented from the denial.",
      "\"Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?\" Alito wrote in a dissent joined by the three other conservative justices. \"The answer to that question should be an emphatic 'No,' but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned.\"",
      "Proceedings in the case are ongoing, and the district court is set to hold a hearing on the contractors' request for longer relief Thursday.",
      "Pointing to those ongoing hearings, the court said that the \"district court should clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines.\"",
      "The order is among the first the Supreme Court issued as dozens of legal challenges to the president's policies move through the federal courts. The high court has been asked to intervene in one other case so far, arising out of Mr. Trump's removal of the head of the federal agency that oversees whistleblowers. It put off the president's request to allow him to fire that official, special counsel Hampton Dellinger, amid ongoing legal proceedings and has not yet weighed in further.",
      "The legal fight over foreign aid",
      "The Trump administration came to the high court for emergency relief last week after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered the government to pay all invoices and reimbursement requests to USAID and State Department contractors for work finished before Feb. 13.",
      "Ali is overseeing a challenge to Mr. Trump's 90-day pause on foreign assistance brought by a group of nonprofits and businesses that receive foreign aid funding and argue the freeze is an unconstitutional exercise of presidential power. Last month, he temporarily barred the administration from halting the foreign-assistance funding. Then, after State Department and USAID contractors said last week that they were still not receiving money they were owed, Ali issued an order requiring the Trump administration to comply with his earlier Feb. 13 directive and pay all invoices and funding requests on contracts, grants and other agreements for work finished before that date.",
      "The judge required the government to pay the contractors by 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 26.",
      "The Justice Department appealed Ali's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but it declined to intervene after finding that order could not be appealed.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris asked the court to first temporarily halt the district court's order \u2014 pausing last Wednesday night's deadline for the administration to unfreeze foreign aid funds \u2014 and then toss it out altogether.",
      "Harris said that Ali's order was not limited to payments to the nonprofits and companies that brought the case, but was more broad and required it to pay nearly $2 billion on thousands of payment requests.",
      "\"This new order requiring payment of enormous sums of foreign-assistance money in less than 36 hours intrudes on the prerogatives of the Executive Branch,\" she wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"The president's power is at its apex \u2014 and the power of the judiciary is at its nadir \u2014 in matters of foreign affairs.\"",
      "The acting solicitor general said the district court's order prevents the executive branch from not only \"ensuring that foreign-aid payments are consistent with the president's policy priorities, but from conducting even basic diligence to ensure that payments are free from fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Harris reiterated that in seeking emergency relief, the Trump administration wanted to ensure agencies were not at risk of violating a federal court order requiring the foreign aid payments. But restarting the funding required multiple stages and multiple agencies, she said, making compliance with Ali's deadline effectively impossible.",
      "\"The Executive Branch takes seriously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts,\" she said.",
      "But lawyers for the company and nonprofits urged the Supreme Court to deny Mr. Trump's request, in part because it lacks jurisdiction to review a district court order that directed the government to comply with its temporary measure.",
      "\"The government's application, in this posture, amounts to a request for license to continue defying\" a temporary restraining order that requires it to administer USAID and State Department programs established under the law, they argued.",
      "The lawyers said in a filing that Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 executive order and subsequent State Department and USAID memoranda halting foreign aid and ordering contractors to stop work \"plunged\" the organizations into \"financial turmoil\" and forced them to layoff employees. Some are even facing civil and regulatory actions for employment violations, evictions, insolvency and \"physical threats to personnel in conflict areas,\" the lawyers wrote in the Supreme Court filing.",
      "\"Respondents' work advances U.S. interests abroad and improves \u2014 and, in many cases, literally saves \u2014 the lives of millions of people across the globe. In doing so, it helps stop problems like disease and instability overseas before they reach our shores,\" the nonprofits wrote. \"The government's actions have largely brought this work to a halt. With Americans out of work, businesses ruined, food rotting, and critical medical care withheld, the public interest weighs heavily against the government. These are the fruits of the government's actions.\"",
      "They also noted that since Feb. 13, when the district court issued the initial order, the Trump administration \"never once voiced concerns about the feasibility of compliance.\"",
      "In his dissent, Alito wrote that because of the Supreme Court's order, the government must pay the $2 billion at issue \"not because the law requires it, but simply because a district judge so ordered.\"",
      "\"As the nation's highest court, we have a duty to ensure that the power entrusted to federal judges by the Constitution is not abused,\" he wrote. \"Today, the court fails to carry out that responsibility.\"",
      "Alito also took issue with the scope of relief granted by the district court, which required the federal government to pay all invoices and reimbursement requests on all contracts for work completed before the temporary restraining order was put in place.",
      "The lower court, he wrote, \"offered no reason why universal relief to nonparties is appropriate here.\"",
      "\"Today, the court makes a most unfortunate misstep that rewards an act of judicial hubris and imposes a $2 billion penalty on American taxpayers,\" Alito wrote. He added that while the nonprofit organizations and businesses challenging the funding freeze raise \"serious concerns about nonpayment for completed work,\" the relief ordered by the district court is \"too extreme a response.\"",
      "\"A federal court has many tools to address a party's supposed nonfeasance,\" Alito said. \"Self-aggrandizement of its jurisdiction is not one of them.\"",

      "Green, a 77-year-old congressman, was ejected for shouting early on during Mr. Trump's speech, in which the president reviewed his administration's sweeping legislative agenda and outlined, for an hour and 40 minutes, his vision for how Congress should start to implement it.",
      "How long has Al Green been in Congress?",

      "He was arrested in 2012 outside of the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C., where he and other lawmakers at the time protested the civil war policies of Sudan's then-president, and again in 2021, outside of the U.S. Capitol while protesting a voting rights bill.",

Green continued as Johnson told him to sit down. The House Speaker ultimately instructed the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and remove Green from the chamber.",
      "Green later told reporters he was \"willing to suffer whatever punishment is available to me.\"",
      "\"I'm not fighting the punishment,\" Green said. \"This is about the people who are being punished by virtue of losing their health care.

    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has signaled it will move in court to let Idaho enforce its strict abortion ban\u200b, a dramatic reversal from the Biden administration's stand.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration signaled Tuesday it will move to let Idaho enforce its strict abortion ban, even in the treatment of pregnant women suffering medical emergencies, a dramatic reversal from the previous administration in a closely watched lawsuit.",
      "The state's largest hospital system said it could be forced to airlift women out of state for care if the federal lawsuit is dismissed. That persuaded a judge to quickly grant a temporary order allowing doctors to keep providing abortions they deem necessary to treat emergencies.",
      "The move to dismiss the lawsuit originally filed by the Biden administration could come as soon as Wednesday, St. Luke's Health System wrote in a court filing, citing communication with the Justice Department.",
      "Dropping the case would be among the new administration's first major moves on abortion. In his first term, President Trump appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn the nationwide right to abortion in 2022. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "History of legal battle over Idaho abortion ban",
      "In its original lawsuit against Idaho, the Biden administration argued that federal law required doctors to perform abortions in emergency situations if a patient's health or life were at serious risk - even if ending the pregnancy could run afoul of the state's abortion ban, one of the country's most restrictive.",
      "Idaho has pushed back, saying that its state law allows for abortions in life-threatening situations and that the Democratic administration was trying to improperly expand its exceptions.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year and ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations.",
      "The high court did not, however, resolve key legal questions in the case, and it was argued before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. The appeals court hasn't ruled yet.",
      "Idaho Deputy Attorney General Brian Church had urged the court to reject St. Luke's request for a restraining order, saying the hospital system was trying to reinterpret federal law and wrest control from the state legislature now that, \"the United States is abandoning its erroneous interpretation\" that federal law requires emergency abortions.",
      "\"It is now seeking to usurp the role of the Idaho Legislature in setting statewide medical standards of care,\" Church wrote. He said any changes to state policy should come from the ballot box, not the courts.",
      "When might emergency abortions be performed?",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "When Idaho was able to fully enforce its ban during medical emergencies, some Idaho doctors reported that pregnant women were facing delays in care and in some cases being flown to out-of-state hospitals for treatment they would have previously been able to get at home.",
      "\"My colleagues and I lived in constant fear that patients would present in an emergency room who were not stable enough to transfer, yet the medically indicated stabilizing care-termination-could not be provided because it was not yet needed to prevent the patient's death,\" one doctor said in court documents.",
      "While the law does allow for life-saving abortions, it's still impossible to tell exactly when a dire case crosses the line to potentially fatal in the eyes of the law, she wrote.",
      "In another abortion-related case this week, the Trump administration received additional time to make a filing - which would also give it time to change the government's position on the issue. In that case, the states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are seeking to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone. Under Mr. Biden, the government was defending access.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022.

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014\u00a0President Trump's address to a joint session of Congress was quickly interrupted Tuesday night, as Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas stood and shouted in protest when Mr. Trump began touting his victory in the 2024 election. Green was quickly escorted from the House chamber.",
      "Who is Al Green?",
      "Green, 77, has represented a Houston, Texas, district in the House since 2005.",
      "The Texas Democrat has previously pushed to remove Mr. Trump from office, authoring articles of impeachment against him during the president's first term. He threatened to do so again last month after the president suggested the U.S. would take over Gaza.",
      "Why was Congressman Green escorted out of Trump's joint address?",
      "After Mr. Trump kicked off his speech declaring that \"America is back,\" to applause and chants of \"USA\" from Republicans, he celebrated his victory in the 2024 election, saying \"the presidential election of Nov. 5 was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades.\"",
      "As the president cited his victory in the swing states and claimed to have won the popular vote by \"big numbers,\" Green could be seen shouting as he stood and raised his cane in the president's direction.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, seated behind Mr. Trump on the dais, gaveled down and warned Green to be quiet, saying \"members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the house and to cease any further disruptions.\"",
      "\"That's your warning,\" Johnson said.",
      "As Green continued, Johnson repeatedly urged him to take his seat, before directing the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"",
      "After he was removed from the chamber, Green told reporters that he was \"willing to suffer whatever punishment is available to me.\"",
      "\"Whatever the punishment is,\" Green said. \"I'm not fighting the punishment. This is about the people who are being punished by virtue of losing their health care. This is the richest country in the world, and we have people who don't have good health care. We've got to do better and now we're about to cut Medicaid, which is for poor.\"",
      "Have other Democrats protested during Trump's speech?",
      "Green's interruption came after questions swirled about how Democrats would conduct themselves during Mr. Trump's address. A group of House Democratic women wore pink Tuesday night to protest how they say the president's policies are \"devastating women,\" while other lawmakers held up signs or otherwise displayed their discontent.",
      "Other Democrats conducted acts of protests, with four House Democratic women taking off their pink blazers, stood up, and turned around to reveal black tee shirts with wording on the back \u2014 at least one of them said \"RESIST.\" They then walked out of the chamber.",
      "Several other members also walked out of the chamber.",
      "Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, meanwhile, displayed a white board that said \"start by paying your taxes\" when Mr. Trump asked Congress to extend his 2017 tax cuts, which are set to sunset at the end of 2025.",
      "Another Democrat, Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, held a sign that said \"this is not normal\" while Mr. Trump walked out. Republican Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas then snatched it out of her hands and threw the paper into the air. Gooden posted on social media afterward \"No one will disrespect President @realdonaldtrump in front of me.\"",
      "During his speech, Mr. Trump addressed some of the Democrats who protested, saying \"I look at the Democrats in front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do.\"",
      "\"I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what. Five times I've been up here, it's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.\"",
      "A small number of Democrats opted not to attend Tuesday night's address, including Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But Democrats didn't stage a large-scale boycott of the speech.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries outlined expectations in a letter to colleagues, saying that while the decision to attend is a \"personal one\" he emphasized that it's \"important to have a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber.\"",

    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

      "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts\u00a0\u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"",
      "\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",

The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",

Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",

      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",

    "summary": "The Blue Ghost touchdown kicks off two weeks of around-the-clock research by NASA science and technology payloads.",
    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crises \u2014 in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",
      "\"Engine shutdown confirmed,\" a flight controller verified.",
      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",
      "\"IMU (inertial measurement unit) reports lunar gravity, and it is stable,\" another controller reported, prompting the start of applause from onlookers.",
      "Will Coogan, the chief engineer, then came on the line with the official results: \"You all stuck the landing! We're on the moon!\"",
      "The assembled Fireflies instantly burst into cheers, hugs and raucous applause. A few minutes later, \"Make Space Great Again\" hats were handed out.",
      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling. So, yeah, the next full moon, I just won't sleep. I'll just stare at it all night.\"",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations, built for $44 million, to the moon as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program aims to encourage private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Nicky Fox, director of space science at NASA Headquarters.",
      "\"We learned so many lessons during the Apollo era, and the technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments, and, most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Firefly's instruments include three designed to study how landing thrusters disturb the lunar soil, how fine-grained dust particles adhere to spacecraft surfaces and whether electrodynamic techniques for removing accumulated contamination will work in the lunar environment.",
      "A drill will bore into the surface below the Blue Ghost to measure soil temperatures at different depths while a novel sample collection system will attempt to literally blow surface particles into a capture device, foregoing the need for robot arm-type retrieval systems.",
      "A radiation-tolerant computer will be tested, another instrument will attempt to pull in and process GPS navigation satellite data from Earth, a retroreflector will serve as a positioning target for Earth-based lasers and another instrument will take X-ray images showing interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.",
      "Along with its initial Blue Ghost mission, Firefly holds a $130 million CLPS contract for a second flight in 2026, this one to the moon's far side featuring a Blue Ghost lander and an orbital spacecraft called Elytra. Another CLPS contract valued at $179 million is helping pay for a Blue Ghost lander, a rover and another orbiter.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Blue Ghost is the first of three commercially-developed landers, all launched within the last month and a half, to reach the lunar surface.",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket last January was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent its first lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "The appropriately-named Resilience took a different route to the moon than Blue Ghost, a low-energy trajectory utilizing lunar gravity to help reach the desired descent orbit for a landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6. The company's first lander, Odysseus, successfully landed on the moon last year, but it tipped over on touchdown and was unable to complete all its planned research.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a small rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",

      "Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York was expected to have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 06:12:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Law enforcement agencies from Australia to Canada helped detain dozens of suspects linked to a Denmark-based AI child sex abuse platform, Europol says.",
    "story": [
      "The Hague\u00a0\u2014 A global campaign has led to at least 25 arrests over child sexual abuse content generated by artificial intelligence and distributed online, Europol said Friday.",
      "\"Operation Cumberland has been one of the first cases involving AI-generated child sexual abuse material, making it exceptionally challenging for investigators due to the lack of national legislation addressing these crimes,\" the Hague-based European police agency said in a statement.",
      "The majority of the arrests were made Wednesday during the world-wide operation led by the Danish police, and which also involved law enforcement agencies from the EU, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. U.S. law enforcement agencies did not take part in the operation, according to Europol.",
      "It followed the arrest last November of the main suspect in the case, a Danish national who ran an online platform where he distributed the AI material he produced.",
      "After a \"symbolic online payment, users from around the world were able to obtain a password to access the platform and watch children being abused,\" Europol said.",
      "Online child sexual exploitation remains one of the most threatening manifestations of cybercrime in the European Union, the agency warned.",
      "It \"continues to be one of the top priorities for law enforcement agencies, which are dealing with an ever-growing volume of illegal content,\" it said, adding that more arrests were expected as the investigation continued.",
      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",
      "According to a report by CBS News' Jim Axelrod in December that focused on one girl who had been targeted for such abuse by a classmate, there were more than 21,000 deepfake pornographic pictures or videos online during 2023, an increase of more than 460% over the year prior. The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",
      "Just weeks ago the Senate passed a bipartisan bill called the \"TAKE IT DOWN Act\" that, if signed into law, would criminalize the \"publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \"deepfake revenge pornography\"), and requires social media and similar websites to implement procedures to remove such content within 48 hours of notice from a victim,\" according to a description on the U.S. Senate website.",
      "As it stands, some social media platforms have appeared unable or unwilling to crackdown on the spread of sexualized, AI-generated deepfake content, including fake images depicting celebrities. In mid-February, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said it had removed over a dozen fraudulent sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on Facebook.",
      "\"This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement sent by email at the time.",

      "The top administration officials are in the border town of Eagle Pass, Texas, roughly 100 miles west of San Antonio. Vance and Hegseth represent the highest-ranking administration officials to visit the southern border since Mr. Trump's inauguration. They arrived one day after the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on nearly all imported goods from Mexico, citing Mexico's handling of the situation at the border, a move that sent\u00a0stocks tumbling.",
      "\"We need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the USA,\" the president said Tuesday night. \"They're going to stop it. I have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history.\"",
      "Illegal border crossings at the U.S. southern border\u00a0have plummeted since Mr. Trump took office. In February, his first full month in office, the White House says illegal border crossings reached the lowest level in at least 25 years. And the administration says more than 50,000 people in the country illegally have been removed from the U.S., a figure that includes migrants with violent criminal histories.",
      "Two U.S. officials say there are no Department of Defense flights scheduled to take migrants in the U.S. illegally to Guantanamo or to other foreign countries, after the Pentagon began supplying costly deportation flights.

Sharifullah used an interpreter to communicate with the judge. Attorneys argued he has no assets and needs a federal public defender.",
      "U.S. officials said Sharifullah was one of two masterminds involved in the planning of the bombing. He is described as a regional Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K, commander.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-stock-market-impact-on-your-401k-plan/",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 15:07:37 -0500",
    "summary": "The stock market has swung wildly since President Trump placed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Here's what to know about your 401(k).",
    "story": [
      "During his Tuesday night address\u00a0to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause \"a little disturbance.\" But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings.",
      "The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",
      "\"And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success,\" he added. \"They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market.\"",

    "summary": "Automakers will get a one-month reprieve from 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is giving a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of tariffs that took effect on March 4, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "The goal is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "Shares of U.S. automakers jumped on Wednesday afternoon, with Ford Motor rising 47 cents, or 5.1%, to $9.58. GM shares gained about 7%, while Stellantis climbed 9.2%.",

      "The resolution was introduced as \"privileged,\" which forces the House to vote on the matter within two legislative days. It says Green's behavior \"was a breach of proper conduct.\"",
      "Green was quickly removed from the House chamber just minutes into Mr. Trump's speech after he stood and raised his cane in the president's direction and shouted. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, warned Green to take his seat \"maintain decorum,\" but the Texas Democrat continued. Johnson then directed the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"",
      "After his removal, Green said he was \"willing to suffer whatever punishment is available to me.\"",

    "summary": "The controversial Chilean artist had said the exhibition was meant to raise awareness of mass meat production processes.",
    "story": [
      "Three piglets which were being allowed to starve as part of a controversial art exhibition in Denmark that had drawn international attention have been stolen, the artist said on Wednesday.",
      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti said he had been aiming to raise awareness of the suffering caused by mass meat production with his art installation that opened last week in Copenhagen. The piglets were being denied food and water and would have been allowed to starve to death.",
      "But in an unexpected twist Evaristti has revealed that the piglets \u2014 dubbed Lucia, Simon and Benjamin \u2014 were taken by animal rights activists who were assisted by his friend, Caspar Steffensen.",
      "\"I called up police on Saturday to report the piglets stolen and I had to shut down the entire exhibition because of that \u2014 so I was very disappointed when Caspar told me on Tuesday that he was involved in the theft,\" said Evaristti, who claimed to have received hate mail.",
      "\"But then I thought about it for a few hours and realized that at least this way the piglets would have a happy life,\" he added.",
      "Copenhagen police confirmed Wednesday that it had received reports \"that the pigs had been stolen from the exhibition.\"",
      "Evaristti's \"And Now You Care\" exhibition involved a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing the three piglets. He said the intention of the art installation was to raise awareness about the cruelties of modern pig production in Denmark.",
      "The Animal Protection Denmark welfare group says that sows are bred in the Danish pig industry to produce about 20 piglets at a time, but only have 14 teats, forcing the piglets to compete for breastmilk, leading to starvation of many.",
      "However, several animal rights groups expressed concern about Evaristti's exhibition, saying that while they welcomed initiatives to raise awareness they did not condone the abuse of animals.",
      "Steffensen said he could not allow the three animals to face a painful death after his 10-year-old daughter had begged him to \"make sure the piggies won't die.\"",
      "\"So when I was approached by an activist to help free the animals, I let them into the gallery secretively on Saturday,\" Steffensen told the AP.",
      "He said he wasn't initially planning to tell Evaristti about the removal of the pigs, but when the animal advocate group De Glemte Danske posted a statement online Tuesday saying it had rescued the piglets, the secret operation became public.",
      "Evaristti says he is already developing ways to revive the exhibition. One idea is to steal dead piglets from meat processing plants and present them to the public. He also wants to buy another three piglets \u2014 not to starve, but to auction to the highest bidder promising them a happy life.",
      "\"I got a lot of hate messages from around the world \u2014 I think people don't get that my art is about animals rights,\" Evaristti said.",

    "summary": "House Republicans are pursuing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, with just 10 days left to head off a shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans are pursuing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, looking to shore up support for the continuing resolution with less than 10 days to prevent a government shutdown.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson has outlined plans for the measure, which is expected to extend funding at current levels through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30, and has the backing of President Trump. But Republicans are facing pressure to do so without support from Democrats. And whether Johnson can get the measure through the House, with a razor-thin Republican majority, remains to be seen.",
      "Members of the House Freedom Caucus, who often oppose the temporary funding measures, are meeting with the president at the White House Wednesday as Republicans move forward with the funding plan, which could be voted on early next week. Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he's hoping to release the text of the continuing resolution by the end of the week.",
      "In recent years, funding the government has created a headache for Johnson and his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, because of the narrow GOP majority in the House and opposition to temporary funding measures by a group of conservative hardliners. The dynamic has repeatedly forced Republicans to rely on Democrats to keep the government funded, fueling frustration among members of the House GOP ranks.",
      "But Democrats, now in the minority in both chambers and with few opportunities for leverage, are in a different position. As the Trump administration works to dramatically and quickly downsize large swaths of the executive branch, Democrats have been seeking guardrails on Mr. Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress and are intent on including language in the funding measure. Without the guardrails, Democrats argue that the stopgap measure would give the administration more opportunities to cut federal programs.",
      "Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he thinks what Democrats are requesting is \"unconstitutional,\" saying \"this should be a conversation about numbers, and not about limiting the other branch of government.\"",
      "Without support from Democrats, House Republicans must keep their conference in line to approve the stopgap measure. Johnson has touted the approach in recent days, which he billed as one that would keep the government open while House Republicans work to incorporate savings from the DOGE effort and revenue brought in by Trump administration policies. He noted on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that the DOGE cuts wouldn't be included in the forthcoming continuing resolution, while promising a \"very different process\" on next year's funding.",
      "During the last funding fight in December, Johnson pushed for an extension until March to set Republicans up to reach an agreement on new spending bills with a GOP trifecta in Washington. And he noted at the time that House Republicans were aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline. But the existing dynamics have persisted, even with Republican majorities in both chambers.",
      "Amid the standoff and approaching deadline, Republicans and Democrats have begun blaming each other. While Republicans say Democrats are flirting with a shutdown with their demands, Democrats argue that the GOP majorities would be responsible for any possible shutdown, and they claim Republicans have left the negotiating table.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that she's urging Republican leadership to work on new, full-year funding bills and prevent a shutdown with a shorter continuing resolution. She stressed that Democrats \"cannot stand by and accept\" what she called a \"power grab CR that would help Elon take a chainsaw to programs that families rely on.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to pass a short-term CR immediately to take down the risk of a shutdown so that we can finish our negotiations and write our full-year spending bills, which is our job to do,\" Murray added.",
      "Even if House Republicans can approve the six-month funding measure along party lines, a 60-vote threshold in the Senate means the measure would require the backing of at least seven Democrats to be approved in the upper chamber. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, who has said \"Republicans are responsible for funding the government,\" called for collaboration on a solution.",
      "\"We believe, we've always believed, the only solution is a bipartisan solution,\" Schumer said.",
      "Caitlin Yilek, \n                                                  \n                      Kristin Brown and \n                                                  \n                      Jaala Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump, in his 2025 address to the joint session of Congress, on March 4, 2025, sought to highlight the\u00a0accomplishments\u00a0of the opening weeks of his second administration. Over an hour and 40 minutes, the longest address of its kind, Mr. Trump spoke of his efforts to contain illegal immigration, the executive orders he has signed and his vision for how Congress should enact his sweeping legislative agenda. He also praised the work of Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency task force, or DOGE, for the drastic cuts they have enacted across the executive branch.",
      "Read the full text of his prepared remarks:",
      "Speaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the first lady of the United States, members of the United States Congress, thank you very much and to my fellow citizens: America is back. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years, 8 years \u2014 and we are just getting started. I return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back. And the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.",
      "The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again. Never been anything like it. The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an Electoral College victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.",
      "Now, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction \u2014 in fact it's an astonishing record, 27-point swing \u2014 the most ever. Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, a 41-point jump. Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive Orders and taken more than 400 Executive Actions, a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it. In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, it's our presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation. By many.",
      "And what makes it even more impressive, is that you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? I don't know about that list but we'll take it. Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they've done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way.",
      "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?",
      "This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what, five, five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.",
      "So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let's work together and let's truly make America great again. Every day my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future America deserves and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action.",
      "Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization, and I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council. We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction. To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.",
      "We ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job. We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me. How did that work out? Not too good, not too good. And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America, it's back. And two days ago I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America.",
      "I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again. Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska. We've ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.",
      "We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. You should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you, thank you very much. We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.",
      "I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding.",
      "And if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours. It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer.",
      "What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now because of us sweeping the entire world, common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, never going to let that happen. Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they've never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they're not sure. As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.",
      "Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg prices out of control. And we are working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that, you inherited a total mess from that administration. Do a good job. A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now. And frankly, we have never seen anything like it.",
      "That's why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency. As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.",
      "My administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. It's never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go. The permitting has gotten and later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.",
      "To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "And to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you've heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you're working very hard. He didn't need this, he didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it I believe. They just don't want to admit that.",
      "Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens, $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma, $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender.",
      "This is real. $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab \"Sesame Street\" in the Middle East, it's a program, $20 million for program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee \u2014 headed up and we know she's involved just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City, real estate developers done very well. $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia, $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda, $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we're doing? Should use it ourselves. A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. The most ever paid, nothing even like it. Under the Trump administration, all of these scams and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them, they're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.",
      "And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on.",
      "Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You're going to find it. But a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country, 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.",
      "Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229, one person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age \u2014 more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. But we're going to find out where that money is going, and it's not going to be pretty, by slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft. And theft we can find. We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.",
      "And today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It's about time. And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years \u2014 balance the federal budget, we're gonna balance it.",
      "With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out. Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.",
      "So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people. They're going to pay a lot of money, and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.",
      "Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America's potential in every possible way. The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead, take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again. Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately.",
      "Because we are draining the swamp, it's very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there, they're waiting for you to vote. And I'm sure that the people on my right \u2014 I don't mean the Republican right, but my right, right here \u2014 I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut. A very, very big part of our plan, we had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.",
      "And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. Oh, and by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made like never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it? That that along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today. All three, the top people and they're so excited. In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world. And this has taken place since a great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025.",
      "And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term. And if you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea.",
      "But that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. That's what one day would cost us, a lot of money, but we're going to do it in April. I'm a very superstitious person. April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.",
      "If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. It's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in that market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because there was so much money. They couldn't do anything about it. We've been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.",
      "They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico, have hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States, will not be doing that any longer. We're not going to do it any longer.",
      "Thanks to our America First policies we're putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies that people love. SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me, said, I cannot spend it fast enough, it's got to be much higher than that. I believe they'll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world's most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount \u2014 97% of the market \u2014 announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the U.S.A. And we're not giving them any money.",
      "Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. All that meant to them. We're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they're building. And many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money, we just want to protect our businesses and our people, and they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.",
      "A new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. I love the farmer. We'll now be selling it to our home market in the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.",
      "The tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period, we had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said, just bear with me. And they did, they did. You really have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great. But Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers. But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you too.",
      "And I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel because if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly we just won't have a country very long. Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.",
      "They're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much. No you're not, oh. And look, look where Biden took us, it's very low, the lowest we've ever been.",
      "Jeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, her very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States. Melania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce.",
      "Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive. Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Ladies Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education, become a teacher. And Allison Berry, who became a victim of an illicit, deepfake image produced by a peer. With Allison's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.",
      "And thank you to John Thune and the Senate. Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. Just terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind. There's nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody. That's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.",
      "But if we truly care about protecting America's children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies. They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast. And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you, and Paul and Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they've all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.",
      "Last year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken's beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.",
      "Last year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. Very strong, powerful act. It's called the Laken Riley Act. So, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. Thank you very much.",
      "Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history. And we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you. The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. Joe Biden didn't just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed. Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.",
      "Here tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis' 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.",
      "The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.",
      "Alexis. Moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that's not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or, if they are too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country because we don't want them to come back ever.",
      "With us this evening is a warrior on the frontline of that battle. Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz, great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. Doesn't sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed to great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. We honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman. The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation. posing a grave threat to our national security.",
      "The cartels are waging war in America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels. Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. But we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the U.S.A. They're going to stop it.",
      "I have sent Congress a detailed funding request, laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history. Larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you're going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast you won't even believe it.",
      "And as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.",
      "Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. Starting at the FBI and the DOJ, Pam. Good luck. Kash, wherever you may be. Good luck, good luck. Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Gonna to do a great job. Kash. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Kash.",
      "They have already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're going to be very proud of them. We're also once again giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they show dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job. But we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.",
      "This also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers. So I have no choice.",
      "One year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. A vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests -- and they were rough arrests, too. He was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests, and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them. I attended Officer Tiller's service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow's name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Thank you very much Stephanie. Thank you very much.",
      "Stephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero. New York's finest. And we're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we're going to do it fast. Gotta stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats. We got to get him out of here.",
      "I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And tonight, I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.",
      "I'm also asking for a new crime bill getting tougher on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don't want to be killed. We're not going to let them be killed.",
      "Joining us to the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is D.J. Daniel. He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. But in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. And D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. Actually, a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight, D.J., we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States secret Service. Thank you, D.J.",
      "D.J.'s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again, chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. With a name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.",
      "Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago \u2014 and you can't even believe these numbers \u2014 one in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it's one in 36. There's something wrong. One in 36. Think of that. So, we're going to find out what it is, and there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby. Good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you.",
      "My administration is also working to protect children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging their daughter to use a new name and pronouns--they/them pronouns, actually \u2014 or without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you. Thank you.",
      "Stories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology. I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth. And now, I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie. And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.",
      "Because we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it's already out, and it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don't we? Don't we feel better? Our service members won't be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country and Pete, congratulations, secretary of defense. And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.",
      "I am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference. And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results.",
      "And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results just about that we've ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see. People love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.",
      "We're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, when he was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete \u2014 a really good athlete, they say. A brilliant student with a 4.46 \u2014 that's good \u2014 GPA and his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",
      "And Jason, that's a very big deal getting in. That's a hard one to get into. But I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You'll soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.",
      "Thank you. Jason, you're going to be on the Long Gray Line, Jason. As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state of the art \"golden dome\" missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A.",

      "And other place \u2014 they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right? Kim. Right. They should have it too. So I want to thank you, but it's a very, very important. This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we're going to protect our citizens like never before.",
      "To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.",
      "We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.",
      "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.",
      "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.",
      "But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work.",
      "They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's history if you bring it up to modern-day costs. It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely.",
      "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.",
      "Now we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Marco has been amazing, and he's going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman. And I feel very certain, so let's assume we got 100 votes. And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it.",
      "But he's already proven \u2014 I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you. He's doing a great job. Great job.",
      "And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.",
      "We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security. And I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.",
      "We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.",

      "America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.",
      "Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.",
      "Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.",
      "And I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly, over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.",
      "What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.",
      "I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. It's happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.",
      "In the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords. And now we're going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.",
      "A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven't been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. A rough neighborhood actually.",
      "I'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight.",
      "The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense, with no security, with no way. Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say, \"Pocahontas says yes.\"",
      "2000 people are being killed every single week. More than that. They are Russian young people. They're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans. But I want it to stop.",
      "Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending.",
      "And we've spent perhaps $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby. That's what happened. And they've spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us. And they don't. But we're getting along very well with them. And lots of good things are happening.",
      "Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let's equalize. You got to be equal to us. That didn't happen.",
      "Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The letter reads: 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" he said. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\"",

      "Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years at a penal colony. Rough stuff. The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin.",
      "But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that. And they are here tonight.",
      "To Mark and his great mom: We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.",
      "As fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally.",
      "That was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did that, did I? Never forgot.",

      "My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector. When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs. Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors- \u2014 we thought they were gone and they were saved \u2014 so those doctors had great talent. We're joined by Corey's wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. Thank you.",
      "To Helen, Allison and Kaylee: Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on. Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot. It was love like Corey's that built our country and it's love like Corey's that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before.",
      "I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that. Thank you very much.",
      "From the patriots of Lexington and Concord, to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware, to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk, to the astronauts who touched the moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.",
      "As we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people. Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it 'til death. We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.",
      "Our ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel. We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.",
      "Now it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era. With God's help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.",
      "We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars, and even far beyond.",
      "And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.",

      "A toddler who was kidnapped by her non-custodial parent in 1999 has been found, according to forensic genetic genealogy company Othram.",
      "Andrea Michelle Reyes was 23 months old when she was allegedly abducted from New Haven, Connecticut, by her mother, Rosa Tenorio, who did not have custody of the child. An investigation was launched, and a felony warrant for custodial interference was issued, Othram said in a news release.",
      "Officials believed that Tenorio had taken Reyes to Puebla, Mexico, according to Othram and the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, but the pair were never located. Another felony warrant was released in 2009, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System.",
      "Investigations into her disappearance continued. Authorities released multiple age progression photos showing how she might have looked as the years passed. Reyes' father \"searched tirelessly\" over the years, Othram said, but there were no developments in the case. Othram said that \"individuals\" even went to Mexico to Reyes' reported location, but she could not be found.",
      "In 2023, the New Haven Police Department began to re-investigate the case, Othram said. That led to a woman claiming to be Reyes making contact with the man she believed to be her father. The New Haven Police Department and Othram worked together to confirm the two were related.",
      "The woman provided a DNA sample, which was compared to Reyes' father's DNA. The comparison confirmed \"that the woman who reached out is, in fact, the nearly two-year-old girl kidnapped in October of 1999,\" Othram said.",
      "Reyes, now 27, lives in Mexico. It's not clear what her relationship with her mother is. Othram did not say if she had reunited with her father since the positive identification was made. CBS News has reached out to the New Haven Police Department for more information.",

The case was investigated as part of Othram's Project 525 initiative.

    "summary": "Read the full text of Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin's prepared remarks for her 2025 Democratic response to Trump's speech to Congress, as released.",
    "story": [
      "Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin in her brief Democratic response to President Trump's joint address to Congress warned that Mr. Trump, in the his first few weeks of his second presidential term, has taken \"reckless\" approaches to managing the U.S. economy and foreign affairs.",
      "Here's the full text of her remarks, which ran just 10 minutes, compared to Mr. Trump's speech, which was an hour and 40 minutes long:",
      "Hi everyone. I'm Elissa Slotkin. I'm honored to have the opportunity to speak tonight. It's late \u2014 so I promise to be a lot shorter than what you just watched.",
      "I won't take it personally if you've never heard of me. I'm the new senator from the great state of Michigan, where I grew up. I've been in public service my entire life, because I happened to be in New York City on 9/11 when the twin towers came down. Before the smoke cleared, I knew I wanted a life in national security.",
      "I was recruited by the CIA and did three tours in Iraq, alongside the military. In between, I worked at the White House under President Bush and President Obama, two very different leaders who both believed that America is exceptional.",
      "You can find that same sense of patriotism here in Wyandotte, Michigan, where I am tonight. It's a working-class town just south of Detroit. President Trump and I both won here in November. It might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist all across the United States \u2013 places where people believe that if you work hard, and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids do better.",
      "It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat. But it was never a big deal. Because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party.",
      "We just went through another fraught election season. Americans made it clear that prices are too high and that government needs to be more responsive to their needs. America wants change. But there is a responsible way to make change, and a reckless way. And, we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country, and as a democracy.",
      "So that's what I'm going to lay out tonight.",
      "Because whether you're in Wyandotte or Wichita, most Americans share three core beliefs: That the Middle Class is the engine of our country. That strong national security protects us from harm. And that our democracy, no matter how messy, is unparalleled and worth fighting for.",
      "Let's start with the economy.",
      "Michigan literally invented the Middle Class: the revolutionary idea that you could work at an auto plant and afford the car you were building. That's the American Dream. And in order to expand and protect the Middle Class, we have to do a few, basic things:",
      "We need to bring down the price of things we spend the most money on: Groceries. Housing. Healthcare. Your car.",
      "We need to make more things in America with good-paying, union jobs \u2014 and bring our supply chains back home from places like China.",
      "We need to give American businesses the certainty they need to invest and create the jobs of the future.",
      "And we need a tax system that's fair for people who don't happen to make a billion dollars.",
      "Look, President Trump talked a big game on the economy, but it's always important to read the fine print. So: do his plans actually help Americans get ahead?",
      "Not even close.",
      "President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America. And to do that, he's going to make you pay in every part of your life.",
      "Grocery and home prices are going up, not down \u2014 and he hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either.",
      "His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber, cars \u2014 and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers.",
      "Your premiums and prescriptions will cost more because the math on his proposals doesn't work without going after your health care.",
      "Meanwhile, for those keeping score, the national debt is going up, not down. And if he's not careful, he could walk us right into a recession.",
      "And one more thing: In order to pay for his plan, he could very well come after your retirement \u2013 the Social Security, Medicare, and VA benefits you worked your whole life to earn. The President claims he won't, but Elon Musk just called Social Security \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\"",
      "While we're on the subject of Elon Musk, is there anyone in America who is comfortable with him and his gang of 20-year-olds using their own computer servers to poke through your tax returns, your health information, and your bank accounts? No oversight. No protections against cyber-attack. No guardrails on what they do with your private data.",
      "We need more efficient government. You want to cut waste, I'll help you do it. But change doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe.",
      "The mindless firing of people who work to protect our nuclear weapons, keep our planes from crashing, and conduct the research that finds the cure for cancer \u2014 only to re-hire them two days later? No CEO in America could do that without being summarily fired.",
      "OK, so we've talked about our economic security. How about national security?",
      "Let's start with the border. As someone who spent my whole career protecting our homeland, every country deserves to know who and what is coming across its border. Period. Democrats and Republicans should all be for that.",
      "But securing the border without actually fixing our broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom not the disease. America is a nation of immigrants. We need a functional system, keyed to the needs of our economy, that allows vetted people to come and work here legally. So I look forward to the President's plan on that.",
      "Because here's the thing: Today's world is deeply interconnected. Migration, cyber threats, AI, environmental destruction, terrorism \u2014 one nation cannot face these issues alone. We need friends in all corners \u2014 and our safety depends on it.",
      "President Trump loves to promise \"peace through strength.\" That's actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling over in his grave. We all want an end to the war in Ukraine, but Reagan understood that true strength required America to combine our military and economic might with moral clarity.",
      "And that scene in the Oval Office wasn't just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump's whole approach to the world. He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends, like Canada, in the teeth. He sees American leadership as merely a series of real estate transactions.",
      "As a Cold War kid, I'm thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s. Trump would have lost us the Cold War.",
      "Donald Trump's actions suggest that, in his heart, he doesn't believe we are an exceptional nation. He clearly doesn't think we should lead the world.",
      "Look, America's not perfect. But I stand with most Americans who believe we are still exceptional. Unparalleled. And I would rather have American leadership over Chinese or Russian leadership any day of the week.",
      "Because for generations, America has offered something better.",
      "Our security and our prosperity, yes. But our democracy, our very system of government, has been the aspiration of the world. And right now, it's at risk.",
      "It's at risk when a president decides he can pick and choose what rules he wants to follow, when he ignores court orders or the Constitution itself, or when elected leaders stand idly by and just let it happen.",
      "But it's also at risk when the President pits Americans against each other, when he demonizes those who are different, and tells certain people they shouldn't be included.",
      "Because America is not just a patch of land between two oceans. We are more than that. Generations have fought and died to secure the fundamental rights that define us. Those rights and the fight for them make us who we are.",
      "We are a nation of strivers. Risk-takers. Innovators. And we are never satisfied.",
      "That is America's superpower.",
      "And look, I've lived and worked in many countries. I've seen democracies flicker out. I've seen what life is like when a government is rigged. You can't open a business without paying off a corrupt official. You can't criticize the guys in charge without getting a knock at the door in the middle of the night.",
      "So as much as we need to make our government more responsive to our lives today, don't for one moment fool yourself that democracy isn't precious and worth saving.",
      "But how do we actually do that? I know a lot of you have been asking that question.",
      "First, don't tune out. It's easy to be exhausted, but America needs you now more than ever. If previous generations had not fought for democracy, where would we be today?",
      "Second, hold your elected officials, including me, accountable. Watch how they're voting. Go to town halls and demand they take action. That's as American as apple pie.",
      "Three, organize. Pick just one issue you're passionate about \u2014 and engage. And doom scrolling doesn't count. Join a group that cares about your issue, and act. And if you can't find one, start one.",
      "Some of the most important movements in our history have come from the bottom up.",
      "In closing, we all know that our country is going through something right now. We're not sure what the next day is going to hold, let alone the next decade.",
      "But this isn't the first time we've experienced significant and tumultuous change as a country. I'm a student of history, and we've gone through periods of political instability before. And ultimately, we've chosen to keep changing this country for the better.",
      "But every single time, we've only gotten through those moments because of two things: Engaged citizens and principled leaders.",
      "Engaged citizens who do a little bit more than they're used to doing to fight for the things they care about. And principled leaders who are ready to receive the ball and do something about it.",
      "So thank you tonight for caring about your country. Just by watching, you qualify as engaged citizens. And I promise that I, and my fellow Democrats, will do everything in our power to be the principled leaders that you deserve.",
      "Goodnight everyone.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to halt a lower court order that required the Trump administration to unfreeze nearly $2 billion in foreign-aid funding, clearing the way for the money to flow to groups that have done work for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development overseas.",
      "The decision from the high court ends a pause Chief Justice John Roberts issued last week to allow the high court time to more fully consider a request from the Trump administration to intervene in the ongoing court battle over a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funds.",
      "The chief justice issued a brief administrative last Wednesday \u2014 with a midnight deadline for foreign aid payments approaching \u2014 before the full court acted on President Trump's bid for emergency relief.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in denying the request from the Trump administration, with Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining with the three liberal justices. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissented from the denial.",
      "\"Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?\" Alito wrote in a dissent joined by the three other conservative justices. \"The answer to that question should be an emphatic 'No,' but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned.\"",
      "Proceedings in the case are ongoing, and the district court is set to hold a hearing on the contractors' request for longer relief Thursday.",
      "Pointing to those ongoing hearings, the court said that the \"district court should clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines.\"",
      "The order is among the first the Supreme Court issued as dozens of legal challenges to the president's policies move through the federal courts. The high court has been asked to intervene in one other case so far, arising out of Mr. Trump's removal of the head of the federal agency that oversees whistleblowers. It put off the president's request to allow him to fire that official, special counsel Hampton Dellinger, amid ongoing legal proceedings and has not yet weighed in further.",
      "The legal fight over foreign aid",
      "The Trump administration came to the high court for emergency relief last week after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered the government to pay all invoices and reimbursement requests to USAID and State Department contractors for work finished before Feb. 13.",
      "Ali is overseeing a challenge to Mr. Trump's 90-day pause on foreign assistance brought by a group of nonprofits and businesses that receive foreign aid funding and argue the freeze is an unconstitutional exercise of presidential power. Last month, he temporarily barred the administration from halting the foreign-assistance funding. Then, after State Department and USAID contractors said last week that they were still not receiving money they were owed, Ali issued an order requiring the Trump administration to comply with his earlier Feb. 13 directive and pay all invoices and funding requests on contracts, grants and other agreements for work finished before that date.",
      "The judge required the government to pay the contractors by 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 26.",
      "The Justice Department appealed Ali's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but it declined to intervene after finding that order could not be appealed.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris asked the court to first temporarily halt the district court's order \u2014 pausing last Wednesday night's deadline for the administration to unfreeze foreign aid funds \u2014 and then toss it out altogether.",
      "Harris said that Ali's order was not limited to payments to the nonprofits and companies that brought the case, but was more broad and required it to pay nearly $2 billion on thousands of payment requests.",
      "\"This new order requiring payment of enormous sums of foreign-assistance money in less than 36 hours intrudes on the prerogatives of the Executive Branch,\" she wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"The president's power is at its apex \u2014 and the power of the judiciary is at its nadir \u2014 in matters of foreign affairs.\"",
      "The acting solicitor general said the district court's order prevents the executive branch from not only \"ensuring that foreign-aid payments are consistent with the president's policy priorities, but from conducting even basic diligence to ensure that payments are free from fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Harris reiterated that in seeking emergency relief, the Trump administration wanted to ensure agencies were not at risk of violating a federal court order requiring the foreign aid payments. But restarting the funding required multiple stages and multiple agencies, she said, making compliance with Ali's deadline effectively impossible.",
      "\"The Executive Branch takes seriously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts,\" she said.",
      "But lawyers for the company and nonprofits urged the Supreme Court to deny Mr. Trump's request, in part because it lacks jurisdiction to review a district court order that directed the government to comply with its temporary measure.",
      "\"The government's application, in this posture, amounts to a request for license to continue defying\" a temporary restraining order that requires it to administer USAID and State Department programs established under the law, they argued.",
      "The lawyers said in a filing that Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 executive order and subsequent State Department and USAID memoranda halting foreign aid and ordering contractors to stop work \"plunged\" the organizations into \"financial turmoil\" and forced them to layoff employees. Some are even facing civil and regulatory actions for employment violations, evictions, insolvency and \"physical threats to personnel in conflict areas,\" the lawyers wrote in the Supreme Court filing.",
      "\"Respondents' work advances U.S. interests abroad and improves \u2014 and, in many cases, literally saves \u2014 the lives of millions of people across the globe. In doing so, it helps stop problems like disease and instability overseas before they reach our shores,\" the nonprofits wrote. \"The government's actions have largely brought this work to a halt. With Americans out of work, businesses ruined, food rotting, and critical medical care withheld, the public interest weighs heavily against the government. These are the fruits of the government's actions.\"",
      "They also noted that since Feb. 13, when the district court issued the initial order, the Trump administration \"never once voiced concerns about the feasibility of compliance.\"",
      "In his dissent, Alito wrote that because of the Supreme Court's order, the government must pay the $2 billion at issue \"not because the law requires it, but simply because a district judge so ordered.\"",

      "A man pretending to represent a professional basketball player allegedly swallowed hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stolen Tiffany jewelry, according to court documents.",
      "Jaythan Gilder, 32, of Houston, Texas, allegedly robbed a Tiffany & Co. jewelry store in a mall in Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 26, according to an arrest affidavit reviewed by CBS News. Gilder allegedly entered the store wearing a red hat, a red Polo-brand shirt, and very ripped blue jeans, police said. He allegedly told store staff that his name was Shawn and he was a negotiating a sale on behalf of a player on the Orlando Magic basketball team.",
      "Gilder was brought into the store's VIP room because of the value of the jewelry involved in the transaction, store staff told police. The merchandise included two pairs of diamond earrings and a diamond ring. The pairs of earrings are valued at $160,000 and $609,500 each, and the ring is valued at $587,000, store staff told police.",
      "During the consultation in the VIP room, Gilder allegedly jumped out of his seat and grabbed the merchandise. He then allegedly attempted to leave the VIP room by \"violently pushing and pulling\" at the sliding doors. Store associate Amit Nayee tried to stop Gilder, according to court documents, but Gilder \"violently pushes and pulls his arms.\" Police said they saw visible injuries on Nayee's arms.",
      "During the scuffle, the diamond ring was dropped. Gilder was able to keep possession of the earrings and get the doors open enough to escape, police said. He allegedly ran through the store and dodged other staff members. One store employee told police that she feared Gilder had a gun. He left through the store's front doors and left the mall, police said.",
      "A man matching Gilder's description was seen on mall parking lot security cameras getting into a blue 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander. They were able to follow the car through public safety cameras and toll records. Florida Highway Patrol was notified on the vehicle's make, model and license plate number.",
      "Shortly before 8 p.m. local time on Feb. 26, the highway patrol pulled over a car matching that description for a traffic violation. The driver of the car allegedly resisted the investigation and was arrested on resisting charges separate from the incident. Highway patrol officials identified the driver as Gilder. Earring forms and price tags from Tiffany & Co. were found on the floor of the vehicle.",
      "As he was being taken into custody, Gilder allegedly swallowed several items. The highway patrol officers transporting him to jail heard him allegedly say \"I should have thrown them out the window.\"",
      "Gilder was then taken to Washington County Jail, where a live scan showed several foreign objects in his stomach. Police suspect the items are the Tiffany earrings he left the store with. The two pairs have a combined value of $769,500.",
      "Nayee identified Gilder in a lineup at the jail.",
      "At the jail, Gilder allegedly asked staff \"Am I going to be charged with what's in my stomach?\"",
      "Court documents do not confirm if police were able to recover the earrings. An official with Washington County Jail said the earrings were not recovered while Gilder was there. \u00a0Gilder is currently being held in the Orange County Jail, police told CBS News.",
      "Gilder was charged with grand theft in the first degree, and robbery with a mask, according to court documents. Gilder was not masked at the time of the robbery, but was wearing a gauze nose covering and arm bandage, as well as a hat, and police said this \"indicates by state statute\" that he committed robbery with a mask, since the items were used to conceal his identity. Both are felonies.",
      "Police said that a search of Gilder's criminal history found he was charged in a near-identical robbery from a Tiffany & Co. store in Texas in 2022. He is also being held on 48 separate \"failure to appear\" warrants out of the state of Colorado.",

      "Zelenskyy's Feb. 28 White House visit was intended to be capped by the signing of a landmark agreement granting the U.S. hundreds of billions in potential benefits from mining Ukraine's minerals agreement. The signing was abruptly scrapped after the meeting descended into finger pointing over Russia and its unprovoked invasion of the country, and whether Zelenskyy had properly thanked the American president.",
      "Zelenskyy had previously repeatedly thanked Mr. Trump and the U.S., and continued to do so afterward. Mr. Trump's top advisers privately shared disbelief about what they viewed as Zelenskyy's badgering of the president in front of cameras.",
      "Zelenskyy has since said he's ready to get back to the negotiating table.",
      "Ratcliffe said in the interview that Mr. Trump made the decision to halt intelligence sharing.",
      "The president \"said 'let's pause.' I want to give you a chance to think about that, and you saw the response, that President Zelenskyy put out a statement saying 'I'm ready for peace, and I want Donald Trump's leadership to bring about that peace,'\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Ratcliffe later added that the U.S. still intends to work with Ukraine in the ongoing confrontation against Russia.",

But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling in his grave,\" Slotkin said, implying the president who led the U.S. through most of the late-Cold War 1980s would be more supportive of Russia's adversaries than Mr. Trump is.",

      "Bryan Kohberger's defense attorneys and prosecutors have made secrecy the norm rather than an exception, 4th District Judge Steven Hippler wrote in a court order on Monday.",
      "\"This runs counter to the public's First Amendment rights to know what is going on in its courts,\" Hippler wrote. He ordered the attorneys to use the least restrictive steps necessary to protect confidential information in the case, such as redacting some lines or using initials instead of an individual's full name.",
      "Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, students who were killed in the early morning of Nov. 13, 2022, at a rental home near their campus in Moscow, Idaho. When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.",
      "Hippler's directive came as a flurry of new motions were filed ahead of the August trial, including a sealed defense motion to take the death penalty off the table that cited autism spectrum disorder.",
      "Other sealed motions include one on whether the terms \"psychopath\" or \"sociopath\" can be used during the trial, and one from prosecutors about the presence of immediate family members in the courtroom during the trial. Some of the currently sealed documents will be redacted and made public, and others will remain sealed, the judge ruled.",
      "A trial is expected to begin Aug. 11 and last for more than three months. The judge has said no one would be allowed into the\u00a0courtroom\u00a0but that the open portions of the trial would be livestreamed from the court's YouTube page.",
      "Last month, Hippler declined to throw out key evidence against Kohberger, saying that the genetic investigation process that it hinges on was not unconstitutional. Hippler was not swayed by\u00a0legal arguments made by Kohberger's defense\u00a0team that law enforcement violated his constitutional rights when they used a process called Investigative Genetic Genealogy, or IGG, to identify possible suspects.",
      "In November, Kristi and Steve Goncalves, the parents of Kaylee Goncalves, said the details of the case show the\u00a0death penalty\u00a0is merited.",
      "\"You've got four victims, all in one house \u2014 that's more than enough,\" Steve Goncalves said.",
      "Kristi Goncalves said she talked to the coroner and knows what happened to her daughter.",
      "\"If he did anything like he did to our daughter to the others, then he deserves to die,\" she said.",
      "Steve Goncalves\u00a0told \"48 Hours\"\u00a0last year that \"there's evidence to show that she awakened and tried to get out of that situation,\" saying \"she was trapped\" based on the way the bed was set up.",

      "Washington\u00a0\u2014\u00a0President Trump's address to a joint session of Congress was quickly interrupted Tuesday night, as Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas stood and shouted in protest when Mr. Trump began touting his victory in the 2024 election. Green was quickly escorted from the House chamber.",
      "Who is Al Green?",
      "Green, 77, has represented a Houston, Texas, district in the House since 2005.",
      "The Texas Democrat has previously pushed to remove Mr. Trump from office, authoring articles of impeachment against him during the president's first term. He threatened to do so again last month after the president suggested the U.S. would take over Gaza.",
      "Why was Congressman Green escorted out of Trump's joint address?",
      "After Mr. Trump kicked off his speech declaring that \"America is back,\" to applause and chants of \"USA\" from Republicans, he celebrated his victory in the 2024 election, saying \"the presidential election of Nov. 5 was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades.\"",
      "As the president cited his victory in the swing states and claimed to have won the popular vote by \"big numbers,\" Green could be seen shouting as he stood and raised his cane in the president's direction.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, seated behind Mr. Trump on the dais, gaveled down and warned Green to be quiet, saying \"members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the house and to cease any further disruptions.\"",
      "\"That's your warning,\" Johnson said.",
      "As Green continued, Johnson repeatedly urged him to take his seat, before directing the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"",
      "After he was removed from the chamber, Green told reporters that he was \"willing to suffer whatever punishment is available to me.\"",
      "\"Whatever the punishment is,\" Green said. \"I'm not fighting the punishment. This is about the people who are being punished by virtue of losing their health care. This is the richest country in the world, and we have people who don't have good health care. We've got to do better and now we're about to cut Medicaid, which is for poor.\"",
      "Have other Democrats protested during Trump's speech?",
      "Green's interruption came after questions swirled about how Democrats would conduct themselves during Mr. Trump's address. A group of House Democratic women wore pink Tuesday night to protest how they say the president's policies are \"devastating women,\" while other lawmakers held up signs or otherwise displayed their discontent.",
      "Other Democrats conducted acts of protests, with four House Democratic women taking off their pink blazers, stood up, and turned around to reveal black tee shirts with wording on the back \u2014 at least one of them said \"RESIST.\" They then walked out of the chamber.",
      "Several other members also walked out of the chamber.",
      "Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, meanwhile, displayed a white board that said \"start by paying your taxes\" when Mr. Trump asked Congress to extend his 2017 tax cuts, which are set to sunset at the end of 2025.",
      "Another Democrat, Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, held a sign that said \"this is not normal\" while Mr. Trump walked out. Republican Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas then snatched it out of her hands and threw the paper into the air. Gooden posted on social media afterward \"No one will disrespect President @realdonaldtrump in front of me.\"",
      "During his speech, Mr. Trump addressed some of the Democrats who protested, saying \"I look at the Democrats in front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do.\"",
      "\"I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what. Five times I've been up here, it's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.\"",
      "A small number of Democrats opted not to attend Tuesday night's address, including Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But Democrats didn't stage a large-scale boycott of the speech.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries outlined expectations in a letter to colleagues, saying that while the decision to attend is a \"personal one\" he emphasized that it's \"important to have a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber.\"",

    "story": [
      "Arab nations, led by Egypt, that have strongly rejected President Trump's proposal for the U.S. to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip and displace its more than 2 million Palestinian residents so the enclave can be turned into a luxury real estate development have offered an alternative plan. Leaders from the 22-nation Arab League attended a summit in Cairo Tuesday and unanimously adopted the Egyptian proposal, which does not foresee any of Gaza's residents being forced to leave during reconstruction.",
      "The Trump administration, along with its close allies in Israel, quickly rejected the plan, with the White House reiterating the president's contention that the destruction wrought on Gaza during Israel's 15-month war with Hamas has made the enclave uninhabitable.",
      "Palestinians who have spoken with CBS News in Gaza have all vehemently rejected any bid to force them from the territory, and the head of the United Nations and some others have suggested that making them leave would amount to ethnic cleansing.",
      "Hamas backed the Arab plan, but has consistently refused to disarm as part of any ceasefire agreement, something Israel considers essential.",
      "Israel and the U.S. reject the Arab Gaza plan",
      "Israel was quick to dismiss the Egyptian-made plan, with the Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv saying in a statement that the proposal, \"continues to rely on the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA \u2014 Both have repeatedly demonstrated corruption, support for terrorism, and failure in resolving the issue.\"",
      "Speaking after the summit on Tuesday, Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty dismissed that stance, telling reporters that \"any talks about rejecting UNRWA or rejecting the PA is just nonsense and cannot be accepted, because this represents international legitimacy, and it should be accepted.\" He accused Israel of violating international laws and U.N. resolutions and said international law must be implemented.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused neighboring Arab nations of having \"used Palestinians as pawns against Israel\" since the country's creation, and its statement reiterated the Netanyahu administration's backing for \"President Trump's idea.\"",
      "The ministry claimed the U.S. president's plan was \"an opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will,\" despite Mr. Trump saying they would not be permitted to return to Gaza.",
      "U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement, meanwhile, that the Arab proposal \"does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.\"",
      "\"President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" Hughes said, adding: \"We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"",
      "In his speech, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said he believed the time had come to find a pathway to \"a just and sustainable solution\" to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian crisis, adding: \"I firmly believe that U.S. President Trump possesses the capacity to realize this objective, aligning with our sincere aspirations to bring an end to tensions and hostilities in our region.\"",
      "Next week, at another summit in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and its Arab League partners will seek the backing of other predominantly Islamic countries for their plan. A senior European Union official was at the summit in Cairo on Tuesday, but there has been no statement from the bloc to date offering its clear backing for the Arab proposal.",
      "What is in the Arab proposal to rebuild Gaza?",
      "The Egyptian plan, as explained by Foreign Minister Abdelatty after Tuesday's summit, would involve three phases. The first would focus on urgent relief operations and initial recovery, including building 200,000 temporary housing units in Gaza.",
      "That first phase would take between six months and a year and would cost $3 billion.",
      "The second stage would involve the construction of 200,000 permanent housing units and efforts to reestablish vital infrastructure. That phase is envisioned to take about two years, with a $20 billion price tag.",
      "The final phase would add another 200,000 permanent housing units and more service facilities, including reconstructing ports and an airport over the ensuing two years, requiring roughly $30 billion.",
      "On the key question of who or what would oversee the operations and administer Gaza, which has been ruled by the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group Hamas for almost two decades, Egypt's plan calls for an administrative committee comprised of independent Palestinian technocrats to manage the territory for six months, before the Palestinian Authority returns to control Gaza.",
      "The PA currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the other, much larger Palestinian territory. It is widely unpopular among Palestinians and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently ruled out either Hamas or the PA taking control in Gaza.",
      "Abdelatty also said Egypt would train Palestinian security personnel, in Egypt, to return and help maintain security throughout the Gaza Strip, but he didn't say which phase of the proposed plan that would commence during.",
      "The foreign minister acknowledged that before any of this could happen \u2014 even if the plan or some version of it is backed by Israel, which maintains firm control over goods and people entering and exiting Gaza and is currently blocking all aid entry \u2014 there must first be a permanent ceasefire.",
      "A call for international support - and a lot of money",
      "Addressing the summit, el-Sissi called on other nations to back the roughly $53 billion plan \u2014 including financially \u2014 and to participate in a reconstruction conference Egypt is hosting next month.",
      "\"Let us unite to make the channeling of support for this fund a noble goal and a moral imperative,\" el-Sissi said, \"ensuring every Palestinian child and every Palestinian family the right to live in a safe and civilized environment, equal to that of all peoples.\"",

      "But pressure is building from the Trump administration for Taiwan to do more \u2014 similar to the pressure aimed at the United Kingdom and the European Union to bolster their defense spending as the White House seeks to shift the financial burden of supporting Ukraine onto its neighbors, and to get America's NATO allies to contribute more to the alliance.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump's nominee for undersecretary of defense for policy said Taiwan should quadruple its defense spending.",
      "\"I agree with President Trump that they should be [spending] more like 10%, or at least something in that ballpark, really focused on their defense,\" nominee Elbridge Colby told the Senate Armed Services Committee.",
      "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te quickly offered a proposal to boost his administration's defense spending to over 3%, a move that would require approval by Taiwan's congress, the Legislative Yuan.",
      "Lai has not spoken directly with Mr. Trump since the American president won reelection in November, but he conveyed his congratulations through Mr. Trump's former national security advisor, Ambassador Robert O'Brien.",
      "That was in stark contrast to Lai's predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen. Mr. Trump, in the weeks just after his first election win in 2016, controversially accepted a congratulatory call from then-Taiwanese President Tsai, breaking decades of U.S. diplomatic protocol that was aimed at keeping relations with Beijing cordial.",
      "Mr. Trump's transition team said at the time that the presidents had spoken about, \"close economic, political, and security ties,\" which angered Beijing.",
      "Up until that point, no U.S. president-elect or sitting president had spoken directly with a Taiwanese leader since 1979, when Washington switched its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Communist Party-ruled China during a detente with the Nixon administration.",
      "Taiwan may have \"a better hand\" with Trump",
      "While the difference in their personal engagement may be some cause for concern in Taipei, Hsiao, at the Global Taiwan Institute, played down anxiety this week, using Mr. Trump's own framing of geopolitics as a game of cards, after he told Zelenskyy that Ukraine, \"does not have the cards\" to make demands for U.S. security guarantees.",
      "\"Taiwan does have a better hand in terms of what it can offer to the United States in terms of a reciprocal bilateral relationship,\" said Hsiao. \"That remains a robust economic partnership, a strong security relationship and certainly a very critically-important high-tech industry.\"",
      "Despite its size \u2014 Taiwan covers significantly less ground than West Virginia \u2014 the densely populated island is one of the United States' top trade partners. According to U.S. government data, in 2024 it was the seventh biggest, with total estimated trade worth almost $160 billion dollars.",
      "This week, with Ukraine's critical minerals deal with the U.S. hanging in unsigned-limbo, Taiwan's most important, most valuable company, TSMC, which supplies semiconductors to some of the world's biggest companies, including Nvidia, Apple and Google, agreed a new $100 billion deal with Mr. Trump to build five new semiconductor facilities in Arizona.",
      "President Trump said it would \"create thousands of jobs \u2014 many thousands of jobs, and they're high-paying jobs.\"",
      "He said the announcement would bring Taiwan's U.S. semiconductor investment to about $165 billion in total.",
      "\"We're going to produce many chips to support AI progress and to support the smartphones' progress, and we thank President Trump again for his support,\" said TSMC CEO C.C. Wei, standing side-by-side with the president at the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump has frequently accused Taiwan of \"stealing\" from the U.S. semiconductor industry, and taking American jobs.",
      "With the agreement signed, Mr. Trump said TSMC would now be immune from the 25% tariffs he is levying across the foreign semiconductor industry.",
      "The deal likely drew a sigh of relief from leaders in Taipei, but with an increasingly pushy, vastly larger and better-armed China less than 100 miles away, they are unlikely to let their guard down.",
      "\"It's very key for Taipei, its leaders, to maintain calm and [be] cool headed with regards to dealing with the Trump administration,\" Hsiao told CBS News. \"But more needs to be done in order to make sure that the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, which is of course the most important security partnership for Taiwan, remains robust and strong under the Trump administration.\"",

    "story": [
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his Tuesday address to a joint session of Congress that his administration was \"reclaiming\" the Panama Canal.",
      "Mr. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Hong-Kong based group that operates ports near both ends of the Panama Canal. The announcement came after the president alleged Chinese interference with operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group's operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. \"reclaiming\" of the canal. Panama's government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction.",
      "Mulino,\u00a0in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. \"I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,\" he wrote in the post translated from Spanish. He accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" Mulino continued. CBS News fact-checked the president's remarks to Congress here, reviewing his claims about the Panama Canal in addition to other issues.",
      "Mr. Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. Mulino previously denied publicly the U.S. State Department's claim that his country had reached a deal to allow U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free. The Panamanian leader said in early February that he had told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that he could not set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them, adding at the time that he was surprised the State Department had issued a statement suggesting otherwise.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino around the same time and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal's operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations.",
      "\"Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,\" Mulino wrote. \"It doesn't have anything to do with 'reclaiming the canal' nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.\"",
      "In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt.",
      "The deal has to be approved by Panama's government.",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Trump has claimed that Carter \"foolishly\" gave the canal away.",
      "Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was \"the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.\"",
      "\"I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,\" Sixt said.",

    "summary": "Three days into Israel's Gaza aid freeze, one aid group says a resumption is imperative: \"With humanitarian needs sky high, more aid access is required, not less.\"",
    "story": [
      "The blockade that Israel put in place on all humanitarian good entering Gaza amid a standoff with the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group Hamas over how to keep the ceasefire in Gaza going has sent humanitarian groups into overdrive. Organizations say they're trying to figure out how to distribute dwindling supplies to the most vulnerable of the enclave's roughly 2 million people, and there's fear the situation is only going to get worse.",
      "Officials in the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah said Wednesday \u2014 three days into\u00a0Israel's freeze on food, fuel, medicine and other supplies entering the decimated Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory \u2014 that Israel had also cut off electricity to two desalination plants that supply around 70% of the area's residents with fresh water.",
      "The aid freeze has imperiled the tenuous progress humanitarian workers say they were making to stave off famine in Gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire that Israel and Hamas agreed to in January. That first phase ended on March 1, and it's unclear what comes next as Israel pushes for an extension of phase-one, and Hamas demands a transition two a second phase.",
      "\"Israel's decision, to block aid to over two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as Ramadan begins, is a reckless act of collective punishment, explicitly prohibited under international humanitarian law,\" the U.K.-based charity Oxfam said in a statement. \"Humanitarian aid is not a bargaining chip for applying pressure on parties, but a fundamental right of civilians experiencing urgent need in challenging and life-threatening circumstances.\"",
      "Israel says the aid blockade is aimed at pressuring Hamas to accept a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire, which it says was drafted by the Trump administration. Under the proposal, Israel has demanded that Hamas hand over half of the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza immediately, which would be a significant change in the terms initially agreed under the deal brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he was prepared to increase the pressure on Hamas, and he would not rule out cutting off electricity to all of Gaza as part of that pressure campaign.",
      "Human rights and humanitarian, including Oxfam, have accused Israel for months of using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza",
      "Aid group says cutoff will have \"catastrophic result\"",
      "After more than 16 months of war, Gaza's population is entirely dependent on trucked-in food and other aid. Most residents are displaced from their homes, and many need shelter. Fuel is needed to keep hospitals, water pumps, bakeries and telecommunications \u2014 as well as trucks delivering aid \u2014 operating.",
      "An estimated 70% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged during the war, and there is no significant stockpile of tents or other temporary shelters in the enclave for Palestinians to rely on during the aid freeze, according to Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council. The aid that came in during the ceasefire's first phase was \"nowhere near enough to address all of the needs,\" she said.",
      "Noting that six infants in Gaza died from hypothermia during the first phase of the ceasefire deal, Low said, \"if it was enough, we wouldn't have had infants dying from exposure because of lack of shelter materials and warm clothes and proper medical equipment to treat them.\"",
      "\"We're trying to figure out, what do we have? What would be the best use of our supply?\" said Jonathan Crickx, chief of communication for UNICEF. \"We never sat on supplies, so it's not like there's a huge amount left to distribute.\"",
      "Crickx predicted a \"catastrophic result\" if the aid freeze continues.",
      "During the ceasefire's first phase, humanitarian agencies rushed in supplies and quickly ramped up their capabilities. Aid workers set up more food kitchens, health centers and water distribution points. With more fuel coming in to power pumps, they were able to double the amount of water drawn from wells, according to the U.N. humanitarian coordination agency, or OCHA.",
      "The U.N. and associated nongovernmental organizations brought in around 100,000 tents as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians tried to return to their homes to find them destroyed or too damaged to live in. But progress relied on the flow of aid continuing.",
      "The International Organization for Migration has 22,500 tents sitting in its warehouses in Jordan after supply trucks brought back their undelivered cargo following Israel's entry ban, Karl Baker, the agency's regional crisis coordinator, said.",
      "The International Rescue Committee has 14,771 pounds of medicines and medical supplies waiting to enter Gaza, the delivery of which is now \"highly uncertain,\" said Bob Kitchen, vice president of the Emergencies and Humanitarian Action Department.",
      "\"It's imperative that aid access is now immediately resumed. With humanitarian needs sky high, more aid access is required, not less,\" Kitchen said.",
      "The Medical Aid for Palestinians organization said it has trucks stuck at the border carrying medicine, mattresses and assistive devices for people with disabilities. The organization has some medicine and materials in reserve in Gaza, said MAP spokesperson  Tess Pope, but, \"we don't have stock that we can use during a long closure.\"",
      "The U.N.'s humanitarian office said Tuesday that prices of vegetables and flour had shot up in Gaza after Israel closed the border crossings.",
      "Sayed Mohamed al-Dairi walked through a bustling market in Gaza City just after the cutoff was announced. Prices that had just started to come down during the ceasefire had jumped back up, as sellers hiked the prices of their dwindling wares.",
      "\"The traders are massacring us, the traders are not merciful to us,\" he said. \"In the morning, the price of sugar was five shekels. Ask him now, the price has become 10 shekels.\"",
      "In the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, 2.2 pounds of chicken that had sold for 21 shekels \u2014 around $5.76 \u2014 is now 50 shekels, or about $14. Cooking gas has soared from 90 shekels \u2014 $24.70 \u2014 for 26 pounds to the equivalent of $406.24.",
      "Following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that sparked the war, Israel cut off all aid to Gaza for two weeks. That move was central to South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice. That took place as Israel launched the most intense phase of its aerial bombardment campaign on Gaza, one of the most aggressive in modern history.",
      "With the the fate of the ceasefire deeply uncertain and aid again frozen, Palestinians fear a repeat of that period.",
      "\"We are afraid that Netanyahu or Trump will launch a war more severe than the previous war,\" said Abeer Obeid, a Palestinian woman from northern Gaza.",
      "\"The crossings are the means by which people obtain the basic necessities of life, why are they closing them,\" she asked. \"For the extension of the truce, they must find any other solution.\"",

Now facing 20% tariffs on all exports to the U.S., Beijing has refused to back down \u2014 despite its own economic problems \u2014 and is hitting the U.S. with its own retaliatory tariffs. The air of strength from Beijing was projected clearly on Wednesday at the opening of the National People's Congress.",

Dressed in their finery, including some in traditional garments, they came to Beijing for the most important event in China's political calendar.

      "The creature's flailing snapped \"every single fishing rod we had in the boat\" and severely damaged the bow as the trio clung to the sides of the vessel, said Harrison. One man had minor injuries to his arm where the juvenile male dolphin grazed his back and shoulder, but all three fishermen and the dolphin were otherwise uninjured.",
      "But returning the majestic creature to the sea was not an option for the trio due to its size.",
      "\"We looked at the dolphin still alive and breathing and we thought, we've got to start looking after him and figure out what to do,\" Harrison said. \"Because he's stuck in the boat for now, so he's coming along for the ride.\"",
      "The men alerted New Zealand's conservation agency and were directed to a boat ramp an hour away, where workers waited to help the dolphin. On the way, the trio used a hose to keep the creature wet and protected it from the sun using a damp towel depicting players from the All Blacks rugby team.",
      "On shore, members of a local M\u0101ori tribe prayed for the dolphin before it was returned to the ocean using a tractor. Helpers gave the 2-to-3-year-old creature a name: Tohu, which means \"sign\" in the M\u0101ori language.",

      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",

    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "summary": "Other than Pope Francis, these are the most powerful people at the Vatican.",
    "story": [
      "For more than two weeks, eyes have been on the Vatican, awaiting news about Pope Francis' health. The pope has been at Rome's Gemelli Hospital since Feb. 14, 2025, being treated for double pneumonia and other complications.",
      "When a pope is ill, resigns or passes away, who steps in? And who else helps lead the Holy See? The Conversation U.S. asked Daniel Speed Thompson, a theologian at the University of Dayton, for some insight into Vatican City.",
      "Who are the most powerful people at the Vatican, besides the pope?",
      "The Vatican houses the central government of the Catholic Church and is also an independent city-state. The pope is both the head of the Catholic Church and head of state.",
      "In order to govern both, he has the Roman Curia, meaning \"court.\" In modern terms, the Curia is the papal bureaucracy. It is an extension of the pope's authority.",
      "In Catholic doctrine, the pope has the highest authority in the church. He can exercise it alone or with the College of Bishops, made up of all the bishops in the world. Bishops named by the pope to the office of \"cardinal\" can, if under 80 years old, vote to elect a new pope. Some cardinals, but by no means all, serve in the papal Curia in Rome.",
      "Besides the pope, curial officials who oversee important aspects of the church's political and religious life are often powerful figures. For example, the secretariat of state, headed by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, oversees relations with other countries and international organizations. It also oversees the Vatican's diplomatic corps.",
      "The Dicastery \u2014 \"department\" \u2014 for the Doctrine of the Faith, led by Cardinal V\u00edctor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, addresses questions about correct Catholic teaching on faith and morals. The Dicastery of Bishops, headed by Cardinal Robert Prevost, coordinates the nominations of new bishops around the world.",
      "All these officials work under the authority of the pope, advocating for and implementing his agenda. For example, Prevost has suggested that all Catholics should be involved in the selection of bishops. This idea is linked with Francis' call for a more \"synodal\" church: one that is less hierarchical and shaped by lay Catholics' concerns and challenges.",
      "If a pope can't fulfill his duties, who steps in?",
      "When a pope dies \u2013 or resigns, like Benedict XVI did in 2013 \u2014 the governance of the Catholic Church formally falls to the College of Cardinals. However, the authority of the college is very limited. On their own, cardinals cannot make any significant decisions concerning faith, morals and worship. Nor can they undo previous papal decisions or change church laws about electing a new pope.",
      "All the heads of the dicasteries lose their office upon the death or resignation of a pope. The College of Cardinals serves as a caretaker government whose primary purpose is to prepare for the election of the new pope and oversee day-to-day workings of the Vatican.",
      "One cardinal, known as the \"camerlengo,\" is responsible for confirming the pope's death or resignation. He then assumes control over the pope's residence and coordinates the funeral, if needed. The camerlengo also takes custody of the Vatican's property in Rome and supervises details for the upcoming conclave.",
      "The day-to-day business of the Catholic Church continues, but no big decisions can be made in the absence of a pope. The church cannot appoint new bishops, and the Vatican cannot start new diplomatic efforts.",
      "Are officials at the Vatican often nominated to be pope?",
      "Sometimes. Francis was a cardinal from Argentina before his election as pope and had not served in the Roman Curia. However, Benedict XVI, Francis' predecessor, did serve as the prefect of the Congregation \u2014 now called Dicastery \u2014 for the Doctrine of the Faith. Some recent popes served in the Curia earlier in their career but not immediately before their election.",
      "What do you wish more people understood about the Vatican?",
      "Three things. First, the Vatican is unlike any organization in the world. Its religious mission and political status rest on nearly 2,000 years of history. This complicated story provides a unique tradition that anchors the institution of the Catholic Church, but can also block the church from critical self-examination and renewal.",
      "Second, the Vatican is like every organization in the world. Vatican officials can be faithful to the highest standards of their religion, truly wishing to serve the church and the common good of humanity.

      "Lawmakers were scheduled to vote on a law that would increase funding for university education, but opposition parties said the ruling majority was also planning to approve dozens of other decisions. They said that was illegal and that lawmakers should first confirm the resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and his government.",

Parliament must confirm the prime minister's resignation for it to take effect.",
      "A rise in education funding has been one of the demands by Serbia's protesting students who have been a key driving force behind almost daily street protests that started after the Nov. 1 canopy collapse in Novi Sad.",
      "Opposition parties have insisted that the government has no authority to pass new laws. Leftist lawmaker Radomir Lazovic said the opposition was ready to support the passing of the student-requested education bill, but not the other decisions listed at the assembly agenda.",
      "Lazovic said \"we can only discuss the fall of the government.\" He said the only way out of the current crisis would be a transitional government that would create conditions for a free a fair election, a demand that the ruling populists have repeatedly rejected.",

    "summary": "The iceberg A23a has run aground in the shallow waters off of South Georgia, a remote British territory in the Southern Atlantic, researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "The world's\u00a0largest and oldest iceberg, named A23a, has run aground in shallow waters off the coast of South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic known for its populations of penguins and elephant seals.",
      "The \"mega-berg,\" as some call it, is a sprawling ice sheet that once covered around 1,500 square miles but on its journey northward from Antarctica lost about 200 square miles of mass. Either way, the near-trillion-ton giant is larger than the state of Rhode Island, with towering cliffs that at certain points top 1,300 feet. It cracked off from continental Antarctica in 1986 and got stuck in the Weddell Sea, where it remained grounded for about three decades, according to the British Antarctic Survey, a research group focusing on polar science. The group has a station in South Georgia, which is a British territory.",
      "The iceberg looks like a \"towering wall emerging from the ocean, stretching from horizon to horizon,\" said British Antarctic Survey oceanographer Andrew Meijers in remarks published by the research group. Meijers studied A23a while aboard the ship RSS David Attenborough in late 2023.",
      "A23a started to drift up through the Southern Ocean in 2020, when currents put it on a possible collision course with South Georgia. The iceberg and the island are about the same size in square miles. Researchers describe its path toward South Georgia as both meandering and intriguing, as the iceberg has charted a somewhat unexpected route to the island and became trapped last year in a rotating column of water that for months left it spinning in place.",
      "At this point, the iceberg appears to be grounded in the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia, settling roughly 50 miles from the island's southwestern coast, according to the British Antarctic Survey. Meijers, citing satellite images, said it seems to be intact right now. But the iceberg will likely break into smaller chunks and begin to melt shortly afterward, in a process that could interrupt shipping operations and disrupt fisheries in the surrounding region.",
      "\"Whilst the berg is large it is easily avoided by Southern Ocean shipping operators \u2014 who are well aware of the dangers bergs pose, and the location of A23a. However, as it breaks up over time, the smaller bergs are much harder to track,\" Meijers said. \"Discussions with fishing operators suggests that past large bergs have made some regions more or less off limits for fishing operations for some time due to the number of smaller \u2014 yet often more dangerous \u2014 bergy bits.\"",
      "Meijers said there's less of a concern about the effects A23a could have on South Georgia's seals and penguins, although huge chunks of ice in the island's vicinity could possibly thwart their paths to feeding sites and result in less food and higher mortality rates for pups and chicks relying on them.",
      "But the melting iceberg may also bring positive changes to the environment, Meijers added, by dispensing huge amounts of nutrients into the water that, in turn, \"could actually boost populations of local predators like seals and penguins.\"",
      "While Meijers noted icebergs like A23a are normal parts of the Antarctic life cycle, human-caused climate change has accelerated the process over the last couple of decades. Since 2000, researchers have recorded ice shelves losing about 6,000 gigatons of their mass, he said. One gigaton is equal to 1 billion metric tons, or 2.2 trillion pounds.",
      "\"This loss of ice shelf mass has significant implications for ocean circulation due to the addition of freshwater, acceleration of sea level rise ... and possible irreversible 'tipping points,' particularly in the vulnerable west Antarctic,\" Meijers said.\u202f\"These are pressing and active areas of research at BAS and elsewhere.\"",

      "Chalmers said the \"nightmare scenario\" would be for the United States and Russia to announce a peace deal, \"and then tell Ukraine and Europe to 'take it or leave it.'\"",
      "Recent estimates show only about 20% of military hardware supplied to Ukraine is from the United States, with 25% provided by Europe and the rest of the world and 55% produced in Ukraine, Chalmers said. But the 20% provided by the U.S., he said, is \"the most lethal and important.\"",

    "summary": "For years, Mexico has been one of the world's most dangerous countries outside a war zone for journalists.",
    "story": [
      "Mexican authorities were investigating the killing of a local reporter Monday in the central state of Guanajuato, the country's homicide leader.",
      "The state prosecutor's office identified the victim only by his first name, but local media outlets said the victim was Kristian Zavala, who covered local goings on in the city of Silao on his Facebook page. Zavala and another person were killed Sunday, according to the office. According local media, Zavala and his companion were shot dead by unknown individuals aboard a vehicle after midnight",
      "It was at least the\u00a0third killing of a media worker\u00a0so far this year, though it remained unclear if the motive was connected to his work. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists and Mexico's chapter of Articulo 19 demanded a thorough investigation.",
      "Violence in Guanajuato is linked to ongoing conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the most powerful in the Latin American nation. Last month, the Trump administration formally\u00a0labeled eight cartels\u00a0as terrorist groups, including the Jalisco cartel.",
      "For years, Mexico has been one of the world's most dangerous countries outside a war zone for journalists. A record number of journalists were killed worldwide in 2024, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report released last month.",
      "How journalist killings are counted",
      "Sometimes authorities say the victim was a journalist, but usually only if it was someone well known. More commonly, press advocacy organizations share the information.",
      "The information, however, can vary between sources. In many cases, like that of Zavala, the victims cover very local events using social platforms rather than for a traditional newspaper, television or radio station. In those cases, it's also common that the coverage is only one of the person's jobs. They may also drive a taxi or do something else to make ends meet.",
      "The same authorities who are looked to for answers in some cases quickly dismiss a journalist's work as a possible motive or suggest they were involved with unseemly people or business.",
      "The number of journalist killings is down, but does that mean it's safer?",
      "No. Mexico had its deadliest year for journalists in 2022 with 13 killings, according to CPJ and Articulo 19. In 2023 and 2024, that fell to half or fewer, but non-lethal attacks shot up.",
      "In 2023, Articulo 19 recorded 561 such attacks, which includes disappearances as well.",
      "Hyperlocal journalists like Zavala are frequently the most exposed. They cover crime in places where cartels operate with impunity or cover local politics where justice is difficult to access and politicians may consider it easier to simply silence a critical voice.",
      "All but a handful of media workers' killings and abductions remain unsolved.",
      "\"Impunity is the norm in crimes against the press,\" the\u00a0the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report\u00a0on Mexico last year.",
      "What do authorities do?",
      "Press advocates criticize authorities for frequently downplaying aggression toward the press and sometimes not investigating at all.",
      "During the administration of former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, he used his daily press briefings frequently to attack journalists, calling them enemies or adversaries and leaving the impression they were fair game.",

      "President Trump spent much of the speech touting his own record, but he slammed former President Biden\u2019s economic and immigration policies, among others.",
      "President Donald Trump did not shy away from throwing political jabs when delivering his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, repeatedly slamming former President Joe Biden. He even declared Biden was \"the worst president in American history.\"",
      "1. \"We really needed a new president.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, Trump hit Biden\u2019s border policies several times in his speech, calling them \"insane and very dangerous.\" Border security was one of his main focuses on the campaign trail in 2024 as well as in 2016, and last night, illegal immigration featured prominently in Trump\u2019s address.",
      "Trump drew contrasts between himself and Biden on the issue, accusing his predecessor of allowing \"terrorists,\" \"killers\" and \"criminals\" into the country. This sentiment was particularly powerful as the mothers of Laken Riley and Jocelyn Nungaray were in attendance. Both Riley and Nungaray were murdered by alleged illegal immigrants.",
      "Trump noted that the first bill he signed into law was the Laken Riley Act, and spoke about its significance. Later in the speech, he revealed an executive order renaming a wildlife refuge in Texas after Nungaray. He spoke about both of their deaths and touted his administration\u2019s crackdown on the border.",
      "At one moment during his speech, Trump said that illegal immigrants \"chose not to come\" based on his words, in contrast to Biden and the Democrats insisting that legislation was needed to stop the migrant influx.",
      "\"The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation. \u2018We must have legislation to secure the border.\u2019 But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president,\" Trump said as the room erupted with applause.",

      "Trump repeatedly slammed Biden for sending billions in aid to help Ukraine fight Russia, which sparked applause from the Democrats. Trump quickly responded and asked if they wanted it to continue \"for another five years.\" He then insulted Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., saying that she would like to see the war continue.",
      "Trump said it was unfair that the U.S., under the Biden administration, spent more than Europe did on Ukraine\u2019s defense, despite America being an ocean away. He also slammed Biden for not trying to get Europe to \"equalize\" its spending to at least match U.S. contributions.",
      "In his address, Trump said that he had received a letter from Zelenskyy earlier that day indicating that Ukraine is \"ready to come to the negotiating table\" and \"to bring lasting peace.\" Trump praised Zelenskyy for the letter and doubled down on his calls for peace talks, saying, \"If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.\"",
      "3. \"We ended the weaponized government.\"",
      "Trump said that he brought an end to the weaponization of government, referring to multiple lawsuits that were brought against him that required him to spend days in court during his 2024 campaign. He held the Biden administration responsible for those legal battles.",
      "\"And we ended weaponized government where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me,\" Trump said. The crowd had a strong reaction to the statement, prompting Trump to turn to Democrats and ask, \"How did that work out?\"",
      "Trump has long claimed that the numerous legal cases open against him were politically motivated. He also called for an end to the weaponization of law enforcement against political opponents, once again using himself as an example.",

Not long after making that promise, Trump was nearly killed when a gunman opened fire at the rally. Corey Comparatore, whose family was at the joint session, was killed in the attack, while then-candidate Trump was shot in the ear and two others were injured.",
      "Trump slammed the Biden administration for not doing more to secure Fogel\u2019s release after he was arrested and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. The president said the Biden administration \"barely lifted a finger to help\" Fogel, who was released from Russia last month.",

      "Trump placed the blame for rising egg prices on former Biden\u2019s policies, saying he let them \"get out of control.\" Trump seemed to focus on eggs for a moment while staring down Democrats, who were reportedly planning on using eggs or empty egg cartons as protest props during the speech, according to Axios.",
      "He also addressed energy prices and said the previous administration\u2019s cutting of new oil and gas leases was a major contributor to rising prices and inflation. Trump then promised to go after the \"liquid gold under our feet\" and \"drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "In addition to eggs and energy, Trump pointed to government spending as a source of inflation. He read a long list of alleged Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) findings, saying it was just \"some of the appalling waste\" that was uncovered.

In 2022, he signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the largest investment in climate policy in U.S. history.",
      "Trump, however, used Biden\u2019s climate change policies as a point to bash his predecessor.",

      "Ordering the Trump administration to make payments on a timeline of the lower court\u2019s choosing, and \"without regard to whether the requests are legitimate, or even due yet,\" Harris said, \"intrudes on the president\u2019s foreign affairs powers\" and executive branch oversight when it comes to distributing foreign aid.",

The company\u2019s entire business model was built around collecting data from public sources to create detailed user profiles for people in the U.S. and beyond.

The Texas-based firm serves more than 55,000 businesses, including a third of Fortune 500 companies, offering background checks, drug and alcohol testing and compliance solutions.",
      "The breach began on Feb. 9, 2024, when an unauthorized party gained access to part of DISA\u2019s network. Shockingly, the intrusion went undetected for more than two months until the company discovered the \"cyber incident\" on April 22, 2024. Following the breach, DISA launched an internal investigation with help from third-party forensic experts to assess the damage.",
      "It's still unclear how the attack happened. DISA hasn\u2019t confirmed whether phishing, malware or another method was used. However, the fact that hackers had access for months without detection points to serious gaps in the company\u2019s monitoring systems. Adding to the concern, nearly a year passed before the public was notified, which raises serious questions about DISA\u2019s cybersecurity measures and response time.",

      "1) Monitor your financial accounts: Regularly check your bank statements, credit card transactions and credit reports for suspicious activity. The breach exposed financial details, making unauthorized transactions a real risk. Consider setting up alerts for any unusual activity.",
      "2) Enroll in credit monitoring: DISA is offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian. Take advantage of this by enrolling before the June 30 deadline to keep tabs on your credit and detect potential misuse early.",
      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0In light of these recurring data breaches, taking proactive steps to protect your personal information is crucial. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The DISA Global Solutions data breach isn\u2019t just an apparent mistake. It seems to be a complete failure. A company that handles sensitive data for millions, including Fortune 500 clients, let hackers lurk in its systems for more than two months. Worse, it took 10 months to tell the public. Now, 3.3 million people are left dealing with the fallout while DISA offers a token year of credit monitoring. The real cost is years of potential identity theft and financial damage.",

      "A new malware strain called FrigidStealer is targeting macOS users as part of a broader campaign involving fake update scams, cybersecurity firm Proofpoint\u00a0reported. FrigidStealer spreads through compromised websites that display deceptive browser update prompts. When users click on these prompts, they unknowingly download a malicious DMG file. Once executed, the malware requests the user\u2019s system password to gain elevated privileges before stealing sensitive information, including browser cookies, password-related files, cryptocurrency data and Apple Notes.",
      "Proofpoint identified two new threat actors behind the operation: TA2726, which functions as a traffic distribution service provider, and TA2727, which delivers FrigidStealer to Mac users. The campaign also deploys malware on Windows and Android devices, signaling a multi-platform attack strategy. The cybersecurity firm assessed with high confidence that TA2726 distributes traffic for other malware campaigns as well. Some operations previously attributed to TA569 have now been reclassified under TA2726 and TA2727.",

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "As the digital landscape evolves, so do the nasty threats we face. FrigidStealer is just the latest reminder that no platform, not even macOS, is immune to the growing sophistication of cybercriminals. With infostealers like Lumma, StealC and Redline already compromising millions of devices and billions of credentials in 2024, the rise of AI-driven attacks and social engineering scams signals a challenging road ahead.",

      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data. The fact that the attacker managed to gain domain admin access suggests a highly sophisticated attack, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Zacks' network security.",

The leaked data includes email addresses, IP addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, usernames, and unsalted SHA-256 hashed passwords.",
      "This kind of information can be misused for phishing, identity theft, credential stuffing, harassment, SIM swapping and even physical threats. Alarmingly, 93% of the leaked email addresses had already been exposed in previous breaches, making reused passwords an even bigger problem. The use of unsalted SHA-256 hashes \u2014 widely considered outdated \u2014 only adds to the risk, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords and compromise accounts.",

      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Zacks Investment breach highlights just how real the threat of cyberattacks is for financial institutions. With millions of users affected and personal data exposed, the risks of scams and identity theft are higher than ever. The fact that Zacks hasn\u2019t said much about the breach only adds to the uncertainty for those impacted. As these types of attacks become more common, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay on top of your online security \u2014 use unique passwords, keep an eye on your accounts, and stay alert for any signs of suspicious activity.",

      "The hand itself is an impressive feat of engineering, combining soft materials for the skin, tendons and ligaments with rigid materials for the \"bones.\" According to Bicchi, the artificial bones \"roll on top of each other, instead of turning around pins such as robot hands normally do.\" This, along with the tendon arrangement, allows the hand to adapt to the shape of objects, mimicking the natural, intelligent grasping behavior of a human hand. One of the most exciting features of this new prosthetic hand is its ability to perform in-hand manipulation. This means users can not only grasp an object but also adjust their grip and move the object within their hand \u2014 imagine being able to open a water bottle using only your prosthetic hand.",

      "Promising results in initial trials",
      "The researchers put their creation to the test with both able-bodied participants and individuals with prosthetic needs. The results were encouraging, showing that the hand allowed users to perform complex movements and manipulate objects with greater precision and naturalness compared to other prosthetic hands. The tests showed that combined neural and postural synergies allowed accurate and natural control of coordinated multidigit actions, achieving over 90% of the continuous mechanical manifold, and the target hit rate for specific hand postures was higher with neural synergies compared with muscle synergies.",

      "It's early, but 2025 is not shaping up to be a great year for Mac cybersecurity.",
      "In less than two months, we've seen numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, which are generally considered very secure. These threats range from infostealers to malicious software capable of reading screenshots and stealing passwords.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the malware",
      "Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a new version of XCSSET, a dangerous macOS malware that spreads by infecting Xcode projects, which are files used by developers to create Mac apps. While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",
      "This malware also finds new ways to sneak into Xcode projects, making it more difficult to spot. If an infected project is shared or downloaded, the malware can spread to other devices without the user realizing it.",

      "The XCSSET malware is designed to steal a variety of sensitive information from infected Macs, putting both personal and financial data at risk. One of its primary targets is digital wallets, which are used to store cryptocurrency. If a user has a crypto wallet on their Mac, the malware can attempt to access and steal funds.",
      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your Mac from the latest malware threats, including the notorious XCSSET.",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Protect your Mac from XCSSET and other threats by installing strong antivirus software on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Mac users can\u2019t afford to be complacent anymore. Gone are the days when Macs were considered \"safe by default.\" Cybercriminals have leveled up, moving beyond basic adware to full-blown information stealers. They\u2019re swiping passwords, hijacking authentication cookies, intercepting OTPs and even emptying crypto wallets. The threats are getting smarter and more aggressive, and no platform is off-limits. Staying ahead means taking security seriously, because the bad guys definitely are.",

      "Arab leaders convened in Cairo on Tuesday for an emergency summit aimed at presenting a counterproposal to President Donald Trump's Gaza plan. The summit was held to discuss Egypt\u2019s $53 billion comprehensive reconstruction blueprint for Gaza.",
      "Before Trump proposed resettling Gazans outside the enclave, Egypt and other Arab states had shown little interest in Gaza's reconstruction. However, given that Egypt has ruled out accepting displaced Palestinians for \"national security\" reasons, it now finds itself compelled to devise its own plan.",
      "With a $53 billion price tag, the plan is positioned as an alternative to Trump\u2019s vision, and key details have already been shared by Arab media outlets. While Egypt proposes a temporary committee to manage Gaza for six months, Palestinians have made it clear that they will not accept any governing body that isn't Palestinian or any foreign forces within Gaza. The plan is projected to take at least four and a half years.",

      "The Egyptian plan is divided into two phases: the first, lasting two years and costing around $20 billion, and the second, spanning two and a half years with a $30 billion allocation. The funds will primarily go toward rebuilding residential areas devastated by conflict.",
      "Importantly, the plan does not call for the displacement of Gaza's residents, as Trump\u2019s proposal does, and stresses the importance of Palestinian-led reconstruction efforts, and that the Palestinian Authority will collaborate with Egypt and Jordan to train a police force for Gaza. But Hamas has already rejected the plan, and the Palestinian Authority has made it clear that it will not engage in reconstruction efforts as long as Hamas maintains control.",
      "\"The Saudis will fund Gaza if there\u2019s a path to a Palestinian state and Hamas is gone,\" Ghaith Al-Omari, senior fellow at the Washington Institute and former executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine told Fox News Digital, \"Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar want something from the Israelis in return, whether it's an end to the war or security agreements. They\u2019ll insist on a role for the Palestinian Authority, even if symbolic, for diplomatic reasons. The question is whether the current Israeli government can meet these demands.\"",

      "\"A militarized Hamas cannot remain in Gaza \u2013 the strip must be demilitarized, and Hamas must no longer be in control. The Emiratis are even more extreme on this issue,\" Danny Zaken, a senior commentator for Israel Hayom newspaper, told Fox News Digital, \"The final draft of the Egyptian plan will avoid directly addressing Hamas. Instead of stating that Hamas will be removed and disarmed, it will say that \u2018qualified Palestinian security forces will maintain order with Egyptian backing.\u2019 This approach aims for unanimous approval without addressing Hamas\u2019 fate, but the reality is that it has no practical validity, because in that case the plan has no financial backing,\" he explained.",
      "Al-Omari observed, \"Arab League summits tend to be a lot of posturing. Who\u2019s going to take care of security? The PA can\u2019t handle that \u2013 they\u2019re too weak. No Arab country wants to send troops to Gaza, but they\u2019re also under pressure from the U.S. to contribute.\"",
      "An Egyptian diplomatic source told Fox News Digital that Egyptian construction firms are ready to begin work, but the real challenge is political. \"Egyptian construction companies are very capable, and they can rebuild Gaza in three years \u2013 if there is political will, mainly from Israel and the U.S.,\" the source said.",

      "While Egypt is eager to lead the reconstruction process, its ambitions have created friction with key Gulf states, which are expected to finance much of the effort. Zaken, noted, \"The Saudis are concerned because the Egyptians want to control the entire process: Who gets the money, who oversees the reconstruction, who the contractors are for demolition and rebuilding? And even new housing and hotels. The other partners worry about corruption in the process.\"",
      "A former U.S. foreign service official warned Fox News Digital that Egypt\u2019s ability to manage such funds is a concern. \"The Gulf, which is expected to pay for it, is sick and tired of Egyptian corruption. If they fund the reconstruction, they will demand major oversight to ensure the money doesn\u2019t get lost in Egypt\u2019s power structure,\" the source said.",

      "Members of the Hamas terror group gather in Gaza in preparation for the release of four female hostages as part of the ceasefire deal with Israel. (TPS-IL)",
      "Meanwhile, Jordan, which has played a key diplomatic role, has managed to avoid direct involvement in the reconstruction debate. Following King Abdullah\u2019s meeting with Trump, Jordanian officials felt that the pressure had shifted to Egypt and other Arab states. \"The Jordanians were very happy with the outcome of the meeting with Trump. They feel that the pressure to accept [a] million Gazans is off them,\" Al-Omari said.",
      "At the same time, the broader political future of Gaza remains uncertain. Al-Omari noted that despite the ongoing reconstruction discussions, the primary concern for Arab leaders is how to navigate Trump\u2019s unpredictable stance on Gaza. \"Frankly, the main thinking in Arab governments right now is how to engage in a covert process with Trump to walk him back from this. No one expects immediate results, but they do hope that this will move Trump away from the idea of depopulating Gaza,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-admin-rethinking-guantanamo-immigrant-detention-plan-rcna194274",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump still wants to use the base for detention, but a scaled-down version is the most likely outcome, sources said.",
    "story": [
      "President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s plan to\u00a0use\u00a0the\u00a0U.S. naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, to detain 30,000 immigrants has been\u00a0hitting\u00a0major legal, logistical and financial hurdles\u00a0ever since he surprised many in his own administration by announcing it. Now, as agencies spar over responsibility for operations there and over blame for what has gone wrong, there is a growing recognition within the administration that it was a political decision that is just not working.",
      "Among the major issues, especially as the Trump administration works to slash spending throughout the government, is the cost. Taking detained immigrants to Guant\u00e1namo means flying them there, and the administration has sometimes chosen to use military planes that are expensive to operate.",
      "On Tuesday of last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was on hand at Guant\u00e1namo when a military C-130 carrying nine immigrants landed at the base. The Defense Department calculates the cost per flight hour to operate a C-130 at $20,756, so for a trip of five to six hours, it cost the Pentagon $207,000 to $249,000 round trip, or $23,000 to $27,000 per detainee.",
      "Costs for those flights are lower when\u00a0charter planes that Immigration and Customs Enforcement typically uses for deportation flights\u00a0are employed in place of the military aircraft. But the administration has opted for military planes for reasons of optics, according to a defense official.\u00a0When charter planes are used, the operation is still a heavy logistical and financial lift, especially compared with keeping the detainees on the mainland.\u00a0Each flight includes at least one ICE official for every migrant, often more, as well as a medical team. ICE estimates the average cost of one of its regular charter flights at $8,577 per hour and the cost for \u201cspecial high-risk charter\u201d flights at $6,929 to $26,795 per hour, but those figures include \u201cflight crew, security personnel, an onboard medical professional and all associated aviation handling and overflight fees,\u201d which the Defense Department estimates for the C-130 do not.",
      "And the space planned to hold the 30,000 immigrants\u00a0is far from ready.\u00a0Tents built for that purpose lack air conditioning and running water and do not meet ICE standards for detention, according to the defense official and an additional defense official.",
      "The two U.S. defense officials and a congressional official\u00a0said views within the administration about how viable an option\u00a0Guant\u00e1namo is for holding\u00a0thousands of\u00a0immigrants have shifted, though Trump still wants the plan to move forward.\u00a0The\u00a0officials said it has become clear since Trump announced the Guant\u00e1namo plan that other options, including holding migrants at Fort Bliss, Texas, and other military bases in the United States would be\u00a0cheaper and more efficient. A scaled-down version of Trump\u2019s Guant\u00e1namo plan seems the likeliest outcome,\u00a0the\u00a0officials said.",
      "At the peak of its use during the Trump administration thus far,\u00a0Guant\u00e1namo held 178 immigrants, all Venezuelan men. On Feb. 20, the Trump administration cleared out all of those detainees, sending 177 back to Venezuela via Honduras and one back to detention inside the United States.\u00a0Though administration officials have consistently said the people being sent to Guant\u00e1namo are the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d 51 of the 178 were considered to be non-criminal, meaning they had committed no crime other than being present in the United States unlawfully, according to a Department of Homeland Security official. As of Monday, 20 people were being held there, according to two other defense officials.",
      "This article is based on interviews with nine\u00a0people familiar with the situation at Guant\u00e1namo and the dynamics inside the administration over it. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk with the media.",
      "The departments of Defense and Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Asked for comment, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, provided a statement saying: \u201cPresident Trump received a resounding mandate from the American people to implement his agenda of mass deporting criminal illegal migrants. The Trump administration remains aligned on delivering on that mandate and re-establishing a no-nonsense enforcement of and respect for the immigration laws of the United States \u2014 ICE arrests skyrocketing 627% and border crossings nosediving by over 90% compared to the Biden era reflect the administration\u2019s commitment to keeping President Trump\u2019s promise to the American people.\u201d",
      "Surprise, then a power struggle",
      "Trump\u2019s\u00a0plan\u00a0had problems\u00a0from the moment he announced it on Jan. 29, when it was far from finalized.",
      "Trump took many top officials in his administration by surprise when he made the announcement at a bill-signing ceremony. It was the first some had\u00a0heard\u00a0that a decision had even been made to send migrants to Guant\u00e1namo,\u00a0according to a DHS official and the congressional official.\u00a0No plans\u00a0for\u00a0how detaining 30,000 migrants at Guant\u00e1namo would work had been crafted by the agencies that would play roles in it, namely\u00a0DHS\u00a0and the Pentagon, according to the congressional official and the two defense officials.",
      "The naval base was not close to being equipped to hold the 30,000 migrants Trump said it would. At the time of Trump\u2019s announcement, it could hold only a tiny fraction of that, according to two former Biden administration officials familiar with the capacity limits.",
      "A power struggle between the military and\u00a0ICE,\u00a0which is part of DHS, quickly ensued over who would be responsible for interacting with migrants once they arrived at Guant\u00e1namo, according to the two defense officials and a DHS official.",
      "Facing a budget shortfall even before Trump was sworn in, ICE has been struggling to meet the stepped-up pace of arrests and deportations Trump wants. The acting director the administration put in place\u00a0was reassigned last month, after Trump and border czar Tom Homan expressed anger that the number of people being deported is not higher.",
      "Oversight of the operation fell to ICE\u2019s Miami field office because members of the military cannot legally interact with immigrants in detention, the two defense officials noted. But\u00a0staffing there was in short supply,\u00a0the congressional official and the DHS official said.\u00a0ICE leadership needed the agents who would be sent to oversee detainees at Guant\u00e1namo back on the mainland making arrests.",
      "The military,\u00a0concerned\u00a0that it would be blamed if the effort failed, initially surged resources to Guant\u00e1namo,\u00a0according to the two defense officials. The Pentagon sent roughly 1,110 troops and support personnel along with equipment to support the mission even though it had not yet received clear policy guidance\u00a0outlining its role, the officials said.",
      "Members of the military started setting up thousands of tents but without clear guidance about what the tents need\u00a0to meet\u00a0ICE\u00a0standards for holding immigrants,\u00a0the\u00a0two\u00a0defense officials said.\u00a0They said that the\u00a0military had expected to get a memorandum of understanding with details about the tents as early as last Friday but that it still has not received specific guidance. The military does not have the money to pay for those changes or upgrades, and no one has ordered it to make or pay for them\u00a0yet,\u00a0the officials said.\u00a0(Under long-standing federal court settlements, immigration detention cannot be punitive, and it must adhere to certain humanitarian standards.)",
      "DHS\u00a0sent\u00a0only\u00a0one staffer\u00a0to\u00a0oversee detention operations\u00a0and seven contractors when the first migrants started arriving at Guant\u00e1namo, and it did not send more until after the first three planes of migrants had arrived,\u00a0the two defense officials said.",
      "With a continued lack of resources, the military started bringing in more staffing to support the mission, including cooks, doctors and administrative staffers,\u00a0the defense officials said.",
      "For several weeks, DHS did not send any interpreters to Guant\u00e1namo, and members of the military provided those services for\u00a0immigrants\u00a0there, the two defense officials said.",
      "The memorandum of understanding in the works would cover operations at Guant\u00e1namo going\u00a0forward,\u00a0one of the defense officials said. But both defense officials said\u00a0it is unclear who will reimburse the military for the money it\u00a0has\u00a0spent on the effort so far, including flights.",
      "Beyond the problem of the cost of the military flights, the explanation some members of Congress have received from military commanders about the Defense Department\u2019s rationale for the legality of those flights\u2019 carrying immigrants \u201cseemed like reverse engineering them to be legal,\u201d said a congressional official who spoke to officials with ICE and the military\u2019s Southern Command.",
      "Some congressional Democrats believe the military flights rest on shaky legal ground.\u00a0Typically, the congressional official said, the Defense Department\u2019s standard procedure is to render an opinion that an activity is legal before it begins. In this case, the congressional official said, the Pentagon is relying on a DHS memo that says DHS legal counsel has interpreted its own policies to allow the military to conduct those flights. The Pentagon has yet to generate its own interpretation of that law that has been communicated to any of the military forces involved in the Guant\u00e1namo effort, the official said.",
      "Three weeks ago, amid the issues at the base, a\u00a0bipartisan group of\u00a0congressional\u00a0staffers\u00a0planned\u00a0to travel to Guant\u00e1namo to survey the operation.\u00a0But the trip was abruptly canceled by\u00a0Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth,\u00a0who said the area was not ready to accept the delegation, according to a congressional aide who planned to attend. The trip has not been rescheduled.",
      "Hegseth himself did visit the base last week, bringing along friendly media: his former Fox News colleague Laura Ingraham."

      "In doing so, the court on a 5-4 vote rejected an emergency application filed by the Justice Department after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali issued a series of rulings demanding the government unfreeze funds that President Donald Trump put on hold with an executive order.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump touted his newly imposed tariffs and basked in Republican applause for his administration's swift early actions, while he drew a wave of protests from Democrats as he spoke to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.",
      "Leaning into culture wars, Trump inveighed against transgender rights, \u201cthey/them\u201d pronouns and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. He celebrated his crackdown on migration. He repeatedly taunted his predecessor, Joe Biden, saying the former president imposed \u201cinsane and very dangerous open border policies\u201d\u00a0and offering little in the way of olive branches to Democrats, instead touting his 2024 victory as a mandate to reshape the nation.",
      "\u201cWokeness is bad,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d",
      "Congressional Democrats in the room heckled and disrupted Trump, demanding that he not cut Medicaid, waving an eclectic mix of signs to protest him and periodically shouting antagonistically at him.",
      "Here are five takeaways from the speech \u2014 and how it sets up the rest of Trump's 2025.",
      "Trump defends his tariffs",
      "Trump defended the sweeping 25% tariffs he imposed Tuesday on products from Canada and Mexico, saying \u201cnow it\u2019s our turn\u201d after other countries have levied them against the United States.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very unfair,\u201d Trump said as scores of Republicans stood to applaud his tariffs, which he said \u201care about protecting the soul of our country.\u201d",
      "It's a sign of how Trump has transformed the traditionally pro-free trade GOP, though there is some unease in the party about the tariffs' effects on prices and the broader economy.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019ll be a little disturbance,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut we\u2019re OK with that. It won\u2019t be much.\u201d",
      "The tariffs sent stocks tumbling Tuesday, and some Democrats shouted \u201cstock market!\u201d as Trump spoke.",
      "Trump also promised an economic revival and blamed ongoing problems like inflation and egg prices on Biden.",
      "Trump outlines his policy agenda",
      "Trump spent significant time on issues from transgender athletes to the work of the Department of Government Efficiency. But the biggest thing Congress may work on this year will be a massive tax and spending bill, and Trump outlined his priorities.",
      "Trump reiterated his calls to cut taxes and include several campaign trail tax promises in a bill later this year \u2014 specifically killing taxes on tips and overtime. Congressional Republicans are wrestling with the feasibility of those proposals as they seek to pass a big party-line bill to advance core pieces of Trump's agenda. They are still seeking to find room for the trillions of dollars in tax breaks Trump has called for.",
      "Trump also called for repealing the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan law that passed the Senate 64-33 and was signed by Biden in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe should get rid of the Chip Act,\u201d Trump said, referring to the law that invests in domestic research and semiconductor manufacturing.",
      "Democrats heckle, wave signs and interrupt",
      "Within minutes of Trump\u2019s beginning, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, interrupted and heckled him, yelling, \u201cYou have no mandate to cut Medicaid.\u201d He was escorted out after he refused to stop shouting. There were other unintelligible shouts from Democrats during the speech. At another point, several Democratic members walked out in protest.",
      "A group of House Democrats waved signs that read \u201cMUSK STEALS,\u201d \u201cSAVE MEDICAID\u201d and \u201cPROTECT VETERANS.\u201d Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., brought a whiteboard and wrote different messages on it through Trump\u2019s speech, including \u201cNO KING\u201d and \u201cLIES.\u201d",
      "Some Democrats laughed out loud when Trump said the era of rule by \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d is over, and they pointed at Trump\u2019s billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who watched from the gallery.",
      "Other Democrats skipped the speech entirely, including Sen. Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, who wants to lead his party\u2019s strategy, and Sen. Patty Murray, of Washington, the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee and the recent former Senate president pro tempore.",
      "The top three Democratic leaders in each chamber attended. They, like most others in the party, sat quietly and listened without disrupting Trump\u2019s remarks, as Democrats work through their loss last year and how best to advance their agenda and oppose Trump's in 2025 and beyond.",
      "Trump soaks in GOP adulation",
      "It has been months since Trump played to the crowd at one of his signature political rallies. He got a hero\u2019s welcome and a standing ovation from Republicans in the Capitol, who regularly leaped to their feet to applaud him.",
      "As Trump said he is waging the \u201cmost sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history\u201d and touted actions he has taken, the GOP side of the aisle erupted into chants of \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump.\u201d",
      "Trump had no olive branch to offer his opponents, instead needling Democrats at the beginning of his speech, saying there was nothing he could say that would make them clap or smile \u2014 and later blasting \u201cradical left lunatics\u201d whom he called weak on crime. In response, some Democrats yelled, \u201cJanuary 6th!\u201d referring to Trump\u2019s pardons of rioters who stormed the Capitol, some of whom attacked police officers.",
      "Biden offered during his first address to Congress to team up on \u201cbipartisan\u201d goals \u2014 a word he used multiple times in 2021 \u2014 like infrastructure, cancer research and access to education.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, chided Democrats early in his speech for refusing to give him enough. He set the tone early by calling Biden \u201cthe worst president in American history\u201d and played to a longtime presidential tradition: blaming his predecessor for problems facing the country.",
      "\u201cEverybody here \u2014 even this side \u2014 I appreciate you,\u201d Trump quipped, drawing laughter from the GOP side of the aisle.",
      "What was missing",
      "A few thorny issues were mostly or entirely missing from the speech, reflecting the broad goal of rallying Republicans and packing in applause lines in Trump\u2019s address.",
      "The return of Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza earned a mention. But Trump didn\u2019t delve much deeper into the broader issues facing Israel, its current ceasefire agreement with Hamas or the rebuilding of Gaza, about which he has repeatedly posted on social media.",
      "As the GOP\u2019s budget and spending plans take shape, there was no mention of Medicaid \u2014 a major part of the federal budget that could be a target for changes \u2014 or health care generally, beyond a brief endorsement of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "And while Elon Musk got a shoutout and Trump listed off spending the Department of Government Efficiency was seeking to cut, Trump didn\u2019t delve into the federal worker cuts that have sparked anxiety among some congressional Republicans and pushback from the public. He did note that federal workers have been ordered to return to in-person work or be fired, and broadly, Trump said his \u201cadministration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy\u201d of \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of federal workers who he said haven\u2019t been showing up.",
      "Trump also appeared to ignore the looming government shutdown next Friday, which congressional leaders are struggling to avoid.",
      "Ukraine, Panama Canal and Greenland",
      "Trump lamented the billions of dollars the United States has spent to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia\u2019s incursion, drawing ironic and extended applause from Democrats who support the military and economic assistance.",
      "\u201cYou want to keep it going for another five years?\u201d Trump asked.",
      "\u201cPocahontas says yes,\u201d he said, using a derisive nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., which prompted numerous Democrats to walk out of the chamber.",
      "Trump also kept up his calls to bring the Panama Canal and Greenland into U.S. control.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China. We gave it to Panama. We\u2019re taking it back,\u201d Trump said of the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cWe need Greenland for national security and international security,\u201d he continued, calling it a\u00a0\u201cvery, very large piece of land.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to get it. One way or the other, we\u2019re going to get it,\u201d he said as Republicans applauded and laughed."

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 19:27:03 GMT",
    "summary": "Pasture-raised hens aren\u2019t any more immune to bird flu, and their premium eggs aren\u2019t getting cheaper. But prices have held steady while conventional egg costs explode.",
    "story": [
      "Shoppers used to picking up the cheapest eggs at the grocery store may now be reaching for higher-end cartons.",
      "That\u2019s because bird flu is turbocharging prices of commercially produced eggs, while farmers of pasture-raised hens \u2014 who say their practices make for more humane, sustainable and tasty eggs \u2014 have largely held their premium prices steady. Grocery shoppers may be noticing the price gap narrow or even invert, in some cases making specialty eggs cheaper than conventional ones.",
      "Nationwide, a dozen eggs sold for $4.95 on average in January, up from $2.52 a year earlier, as avian influenza has wiped out poultry flocks and slammed into domestic egg supplies. Through it all, specialty egg distributor Pete & Gerry\u2019s says its dozen-egg cartons have been retailing for about $6.99 over the past 18 to 24 months.",
      "\u201cOur prices are extremely stable, which means our retail partners are offering a really, really stable price to consumers,\u201d said Cameron Whitehead, chief operating officer at the New Hampshire-based company that sells eggs from nearly 300 family farms across New England, the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic.",
      "Egg cartons come with lots of labels. The U.S. Department of Agriculture designates \u201ccage-free\u201d and \u201cfree-range\u201d practices as those allowing hens to roam around to some extent indoors, and gain at least limited access to an outdoor enclosure, respectively. \u201cPasture-raised\u201d eggs, which aren\u2019t federally regulated, generally means the chickens can leave the barn and venture out to graze and scratch. The \u201corganic\u201d label can apply to any of these and also refers to what the chickens were fed.",
      "Hens that have room to scamper aren\u2019t any more resistant to bird flu than those that don\u2019t. But farming practices can make a difference in how the illness spreads, experts say, even if there are some trade-offs.",
      "\u201cThe source of the virus is in the wild birds, so pasture-raised birds would have an increased risk of exposure,\u201d said Andrew Bowman, a professor of veterinary medicine at Ohio State University who studies animal influenza. Fully confined egg farms use netting to keep out wild birds, he said, but if the virus does enter those facilities, it can spread like wildfire among chickens kept in cramped quarters.",
      "Larger operations also tend to require staff and equipment that are shared with other facilities, elevating the risk of spread between farms. But no matter the setup, USDA guidelines require the entire flock to be killed if bird flu is detected even once.",
      "All of a sudden, you look back and say, \u2018Wait a minute, I\u2019m the cheapest one on the shelf.\u2019",
      "Egg Farmer Larry Schultz, Owatonna, M.N.",
      "The disease has affected large and small egg producers alike, but smaller and organic operators say their prices aren\u2019t as influenced by supply and demand swings compared with the commercial market.",
      "So far, Pete & Gerry\u2019s has seen minimal impact to its supply, despite the occasional farm hit by bird flu, Whitehead said. The company pays for farmers\u2019 birds and feed, and it offers a set price for their eggs, creating a measure of stability that Whitehead said small family farms \u2014 generally those with flocks of fewer than 20,000 hens \u2014 appreciate amid the outbreak.",
      "Larry Schultz, a longtime egg farmer in Owatonna, Minnesota, said prices for his organic, free-range eggs mainly reflect input costs like cartons and feed. Those expenses have also increased with inflation, albeit more predictably than supply and demand, he said.",
      "When bird flu hit a larger facility in Schultz\u2019s county in 2023, he said it felt like dodging a bullet. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anybody is immune to it,\u201d he cautioned.",
      "About half of the flocks hit by bird flu since 2022 have fewer than 1,000 hens, and roughly 70% number under 30,000, according to USDA data. (The department said its bird flu data isn\u2019t broken down by production types like \u201corganic\u201d or \u201cpasture-raised.\u201d)",
      "Like much of the nation\u2019s agricultural sector, the egg industry has consolidated over time. Fewer than 150 commercial egg farms with flocks of at least 75,000 now house over 95% of egg-laying hens, the United Egg Producers trade group estimates. Among large operators, at least three in Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina, each with over 250,000 hens, have been affected by bird flu so far just this year.",
      "Organic and cage-free egg farmers produce only 15% of the nation\u2019s eggs, UEP estimates, and many of them say they\u2019re struggling to meet rising demand as their products become more price-competitive. But that isn\u2019t stopping some from touting what they say is a more ethical approach to the business. Some farms and retailers have been advertising pasture-raised eggs as exempt from \u201cprice gouging\u201d that they blame on the commercial approach.",
      "\u201cI think the industry probably needs to take note,\u201d said Matt Watson, who sells eggs from his family farm in Chester, South Carolina. \u201cLook at the pastured model and see if they could pick up anything that would help to protect our food supply.\u201d",
      "It becomes more appealing to people if they\u2019re going to pay a pretty high price for eggs anyway.",
      "Egg Farmer Matt Watson, Chester, S.C.",
      "Watson said he embraced more sustainable farming methods in 2007 after trying conventional ones and now raises all his animals on open pasture. He\u2019s convinced that growers, animals and consumers are all better off, though he acknowledged it usually costs more to farm this way. His eggs currently retail for around $7.25 a dozen, but he hopes the ongoing shortage spurs more consumers to take a closer look.",
      "\u201cIt becomes more appealing to people if they\u2019re going to pay a pretty high price for eggs anyway,\u201d he said, adding that many customers will stick with pasture-raised for the taste once they\u2019ve tried them.",
      "Despite adding roughly 50 farms to its network last year, Pete & Gerry\u2019s still isn\u2019t able to meet demand, Whitehead said, but the specialty distributor is hardly alone. The USDA forecasts a 1.3% in table egg production from 2024 to 2025. Stocks of frozen eggs in storage plummeted about 42% late last year, which the agency said is likely because distributors tapped into those supplies to offset fresh egg losses.",
      "There\u2019s no easy substitute for eggs, which makes demand for them inelastic \u2014\u00a0meaning consumers and businesses generally buy the same amount no matter the cost. That\u2019s exacerbating the price spiral, as customers bid up remaining supplies out of proportion with the shortage. The U.S. egg-hen flock is down about 50 million birds, or 15%, from its usual level, according to the American Egg Board, which represents egg farmers. Prices, however, have nearly doubled since January 2024.",
      "Schultz said he had to raise prices recently, which he said he doesn\u2019t do very often. One baker he sells to told NBC News last month that Schultz\u2019s eggs are now more affordable than commercially produced ones, despite the price increase.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden, you look back and say, \u2018Wait a minute, I\u2019m the cheapest one on the shelf,\u2019\u201d Schultz said, adding that his small organic farm is seeing demand through the roof. That\u2019s been heartening, but he isn\u2019t interested in scaling up.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking to be a commercial egg grower,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking to just do what I grew up doing.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is engaging in direct talks with Hamas over the release of U.S. hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Wednesday.",
      "President Donald Trump believes the dialogue is part of\u00a0a \"good-faith effort to do what\u2019s right for the American people,\" Leavitt said at a White House news briefing.",
      "\"There are American lives at stake,\" she added, noting that Israel had been consulted.",
      "The development comes after the six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended Saturday with no extension of peace negotiations in sight. It marks the first time the U.S. has held direct talks with the group, which it has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "Axios first reported the talks between the U.S. and Hamas.",
      "Asked whether the scope of the talks included Trump's proposal to take over Gaza, Leavitt said she would not go into details at the briefing and referred questions to the State Department.",
      "Initially, the idea for a second phase of a ceasefire included the release of more hostages by Hamas in return for Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian territory, with the aim of ending the war.",
      "But with no talks continuing, Israel reinstated a halt in the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza after the initial phase of the ceasefire ended. Hamas then accused Israel of violating their agreement by \u201cevading the commitment to end the war and withdraw completely from Gaza.\u201d",
      "Last weekend, Israel approved a plan from the\u00a0U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0that would have continued the first stage of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover instead of proceeding to the second phase of peace talks.",
      "Witkoff's plan called for the release of half of the\u00a0remaining hostages, including the bodies of those who have died, on the first day, and the remaining hostages once a permanent ceasefire deal is reached, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.",
      "But Hamas rejected the proposal, saying it didn't honor the original, multiphased ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these positions by the United States strengthened the position of the Zionist right within the government and pushed for taking punitive steps, including closing the crossings in this manner and using the starvation policy against the people of the Gaza Strip,\" the group\u2019s spokesman, Hazem Qassem, said in a statement Sunday.",
      "National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Sunday that Israel has \"negotiated in good faith since the beginning of this administration to ensure the release of hostages held captive by Hamas terrorists.\"",
      "Hughes added that the U.S. will support Israel's decision on next steps \"given Hamas has indicated it\u2019s no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire.\"",
      "On Monday, Netanyahu warned Hamas in remarks before the Knesset, Israel's legislature, that if the group didn't release more hostages, \"there will be consequences beyond your imagination. We are preparing for the next stages of the campaign \u2014 not everything is visible, and that\u2019s a good thing.\"",
      "The initial ceasefire was announced by the Biden administration in January just days before Trump's inauguration. It required a pause of Israel's military operations in Gaza and the release of both living and dead hostages held there in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel."

      "CK Hutchison, a conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, has agreed in principle to sell its controlling stake in a unit that operates the two ports to a consortium that includes the U.S. asset manager BlackRock, the companies said Tuesday.",
      "President Donald Trump had argued that the Chinese-backed ports, one each at the canal\u2019s Pacific and Atlantic entrances, posed a national security threat because they gave the Chinese military potential control of the strategically vital canal.",
      "Though CK Hutchison said the proposed sale was unrelated to politics, Trump touted it as a victory in his Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress.",
      "\u201cMy administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal.\u201d",
      "Nearly 15,000 ships from around the world transit each year through the Panama Canal, which was built primarily with U.S. funds and was completed in 1914. About two-thirds of them are headed to or from the U.S.",
      "In 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President\u00a0Jimmy Carter\u00a0and ratified by the Senate in 1978, with the U.S. retaining the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Trump has claimed without evidence that China controls the Panama Canal. He said he would consider using military force to seize it back from Panama, one of Washington\u2019s closest allies in Latin America.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump told Congress on Tuesday. \u201cWe gave it to Panama and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",

      "\u201cChina supports Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and is committed to maintaining its status as a permanently neutral international waterway,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cChina has never been involved in the management or operation of the canal, nor has it interfered in its affairs,\u201d he said.",
      "The Trump administration and members of Congress were briefed on the proposed $22.8 billion deal, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "The consortium, which also includes the Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, would gain control of an 80% interest in CK Hutchison subsidiary Hutchison Ports, which operates 43 ports in 23 countries. It would also receive 90% of Panama Ports, which operates the Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and the Crist\u00f3bal port on the Atlantic side.",
      "It does not affect the company\u2019s ports in China.",
      "\u201cI would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,\u201d Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a news release.",
      "The news sent CK Hutchison up almost 22% Wednesday on Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index.",
      "Control over the Panama Canal has been a high-profile focus of the Trump administration, with Marco Rubio making Panama part of his first foreign trip as secretary of state.",
      "Hutchison Ports won the rights to manage the two Panama Canal ports in 1997 in a\u00a0bidding process that was described as fair and nondiscriminatory\u00a0by U.S. officials at the time. In 2021, its contract was extended until 2047.",
      "Though the two ports sit at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, ships do not have to pass through them to enter. Other ports along the canal are operated by companies from Taiwan, Singapore and the U.S.",
      "The ports serve mainly to handle cargo, while the canal itself is run by the Panama Canal Authority, an independent Panamanian government agency.",
      "Though CK Hutchison is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, Trump administration officials had argued that it was subject to control by Beijing, which has been tightening its grip on the city.",

      "The 88-year-old pontiff, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, had two respiratory crises Monday in a setback to his recovery.",

The accumulation of secretions in his lungs was a sign that he doesn\u2019t have the muscle tone to cough vigorously enough to expel the fluid.",

      "The mother of a Kansas woman found dead in a chest freezer buried in an Oklahoma cow pasture filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the five people charged in her murder, which included the grandmother of her daughters' children.",
      "Amanda Verner filed the 32-page lawsuit on Monday, nearly a year after the bodies of her daughter, Veronica Butler, and another woman, Jilian Kelley, were discovered.",
      "The two women vanished in March 2024 after Butler, 27, went to pick up her two young children for a supervised visit. Kelley, 39, was approved by the court to accompany Butler on the visits.",
      "In April 2024, their bodies were found inside a freezer that had been buried in a roughly 12-foot hole filled with dirt, cement, rocks and equipment, the lawsuit states.",
      "The grandmother of Butler's children Tifany Adams, along with her her boyfriend, Tad Bert Cullum, Paul Grice, Cora Twombly, and Cole Earl Twombly were arrested and charged with murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and kidnapping.",
      "The suit alleges that Adams plotted to kill Butler in an attempt to gain \"control\" of Butler's children and enlisted Cullum, Grice, and the Twomblys to help her. The alleged murder plot stemmed from a bitter custody battle involving Butler and Adams' son. (The son was at a rehab facility at the time of the murders and has not been charged in connection with the case).",
      "Butler was awarded full custody of her children in 2021. She lost custody the following year after Adams falsely accused a relative of Butler's of sexually assaulting the children, the lawsuit alleges. Adams was also accused in the lawsuit of falsifying records that helped her son get full custody of the children. Butler was awarded limited supervised visitation.",
      "\"At some point Adams unilaterally took custody of the children from her son,\" the suit states. \"Adams then intervened in the custody dispute ... in an attempt to gain control over the children.\"",
      "The suit alleges that in February 2024, Adams began threatening the judge handling the custody case. Things took a turn when the court learned that Adams had allegedly falsified records that led to her son being granted custody.",
      "The suit says that custody of the children was most likely going to be awarded back to Butler when she was killed.",
      "Adams allegedly purchased five stun guns and three prepaid phones that she gave to the defendants, the lawsuit says. On March 29, 2024, Adams contacted Butler so she could pick up her children.",
      "Butler and Kelley left Kansas the following day to meet Adams.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Cole and Cora Twombly allegedly used their vehicle to \"block\" the road to divert Butler and Kelley to where Adams and Cullum were waiting to \"ambush them.\"",
      "Butler and Kelley were tasered with stun guns, abducted and transported to the cow pasture, the suit states. A medical examiner's report said that Butler had been stabbed 30 times.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking damages for medical and burial expenses, and mental pain and anguish."

      "Gilder was shown a pair of 4.86-carat diamond earrings worth $160,000, a pair of 8.19-carat diamond earrings worth $609,000 and a 5.61-carat diamond ring worth $587,000, the court document said. He then grabbed the three pieces of jewelry and struggled with employees before dropping the ring and fleeing from the store, according to Goss.",
      "Mall surveillance cameras captured images of Gilder leaving in a blue Mitsubishi Outlander that detectives traced to an Enterprise Rent-A-Car out of Houston, the affidavit said. The Florida Highway Patrol then allegedly spotted Gilder and that SUV on Interstate 10 in Tallahassee at 7:55 p.m., about 300 miles northwest of Orlando and \"taking the fastest route\" back to Texas.",
      "\"As he was being taken into custody, Gilder swallowed several items,\" the affidavit said.",

      "An Orlando police spokesperson declined comment on Wednesday when NBC News asked if the stolen earrings had been recovered.",
      "Police have \"no additional information to share at this time,\"  the department representative said.",
      "The clothes Gilder wore for the robbery were found in the SUV after his arrest, police said. He had \"a piece of white gauze on his nose\" at the store and the bandage was found in the Outlander, police said.",
      "Gilder was booked on suspicion of grand theft and for robbery with a mask and was still in custody in Orange County on Wednesday.",
      "The gauze on Gilder's face didn't cover any wound, meaning the bandage was meant to \"disguise his true face/identity,\" leading to the \"robbery with a mask\" charge, police said.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if he\u2019d hired an attorney or had one assigned to him. He pulled off \"a similar robbery\" at a Tiffany & Co. in 2022 in The Woodlands, Texas, and he has \"48 separate warrants out of Colorado,\" according to a police statement."

    "story": [
      "CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. \u2014 New York authorities on Wednesday outlined an astonishing story of kidnap, torture and sexual assault in the killing of Sam Nordquist, a transgender man from Minnesota who was allegedly imprisoned in a small room of an upstate motel for a month before he died.",
      "The torment inflicted by the seven people accused in the kidnapping, described in an 11-count indictment filed in Ontario County court, included hitting, kicking, punching, inserting an object into Nordquist\u2019s anus, starvation, forced consumption of feces, urine and tobacco juice, pouring of bleach on him and duct taping him. The indictment also alleges the forced participation of young children in the assault and torture.",
      "The brutality and depravity of the crime \u2014 allegedly inflicted on the Black transgender man from Jan. 1 to Feb. 2 \u2014 has drawn national attention, sparked local demonstrations by LGBTQ rights advocates and raised the question from activists and his family: How could such a terrible thing happen without anyone notifying authorities?",
      "The indictment came a day after Nordquist was laid to rest in his native Minnesota. The 24-year-old set out from Oakdale, Minnesota, to Ontario County, New York, in September to connect\u00a0with a woman he\u2019d met online. That woman, Precious Arzuaga, is one of seven people charged in the indictment with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, two counts of kidnapping, conspiracy and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child.",
      "She and three others, Kyle Sage, Patrick Goodwin and Jennifer Quijano, were charged with aggravated sexual abuse. In addition, Arzuaga was charged with coercion for allegedly forcing children, 7 and 12, to take part in attacks on Nordquist. The seven are also charged with concealing Nordquist\u2019s corpse, which they allegedly wrapped in plastic bags and dumped in a farmer\u2019s field.",
      "The gruesome details will likely grow as investigators piece together what happened in Room 22 of Patty\u2019s Lodge in the town of Hopewell, New York, authorities said.",
      "The indictment is \u201cjust a portion\u201d of Nordquist's ordeal, Ontario County Assistant District Attorney Kelly Wolford said at a news conference, where she grew visibly upset as she discussed the charges. \u201cIt\u2019s just what we know now,\u201d Wolford said.",
      "The crimes are almost impossible to comprehend, she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never know the answer why. Because what human beings could do what happened to Sam?\" she said. \"We'll never make sense of this case.\u201d",
      "The seven people charged \u2014 Arzuaga, 38; her son, Thomas Eaves, 21; Quijano, 30; Sage, 33; Goodwin, 30; Emily Motyka, 19; and Kimberly Sochia, 29 \u2014 all knew one another, some romantically,  Wolford said. Records show that Goodwin, a registered sex offender, was staying in a nearby room at Patty\u2019s at the time. Goodwin and Sage were both on parole from previous sexually related crimes. All seven ended up in Room 22 at Patty\u2019s Lodge, where Nordquist was allegedly held captive, tortured and killed.",
      "\"They forced him to obey their commands, treating him like a dog,\" Wolford said.",
      "The Office of the Ontario County Conflict Defender, which is representing the seven suspects, declined to comment.",
      "Over the last several weeks, LGBTQ advocates from around the country have urged authorities to not rule out the possibility that Nordquist's killing was a hate crime.",
      "Wolford said prosecutors elected to charge the seven people with first-degree murder \u2014 and not hate crimes against a Black transgender man \u2014 because that is the heaviest penalty available to them under New York law.\u00a0If found guilty, the seven defendants could spend life in prison without parole.",
      "\u201cA hate crime would make this charge about Sam\u2019s gender or about Sam\u2019s race, and it\u2019s so much bigger,\u201d Wolford said. \u201cTo limit us to a hate crime would be an injustice to Sam. Sam deserves to have his story told in its entirety.\u201d",
      "Wolford called the alleged coercion of the two young children to participate in Nordquist's torture \"one of the more troubling parts\" of the investigation. The children's involvement was not previously known.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. We have a 7-year-old and a 12-year-old who are also victims,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may have been forced to participate, but their lives are forever changed by what they saw and endured in there.\u201d",
      "When asked if the children belong to Arzuaga and if they were now in state custody, Welford declined to comment.",
      "Patty's Lodge is not being investigated for any wrongdoing, Wolford said. She added that there have not been any witnesses who reported Nordquist's captivity or torture to authorities while he was alive.",
      "\"This is a housing location,\" she said. \"It looks like a motel, but these people do live there full time, so what happens in their home is not something that, necessarily, Patty\u2019s Lodge is responsible for.\"",
      "Nordquist\u2019s mother and sister suggested in previous interviews with NBC News that Nordquist\u2019s death was preventable if local authorities had \u201cdone their jobs.\u201d",
      "The family said they requested two wellness checks on Nordquist with authorities. They also said that Nordquist expressed that he was in danger to a local social services agency.",
      "\u201cSam may be alive today if they would have done their jobs,\u201d Linda Nordquist, his mother, said through tears.",
      "After asking New York authorities for help, Nordquist\u2019s mother went to her local police department on Feb. 10 and filed a missing persons report, which was forwarded to Canandaigua police. Two days later, the New York State Police put out a public notice about Nordquist\u2019s disappearance, and on Feb. 13 his remains were found.",
      "Responding to the family\u2019s criticisms, New York State Police said in a statement last month that they \u201ctook appropriate investigative steps.\u201d The Ontario County Department of Social Services has not returned multiple requests for comment in recent weeks.",
      "When asked Wednesday if the social services department was aware that Nordquist was being controlled by the suspects, as his family suggested, Wolford declined to comment."

      "\u201cAfter the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling in his grave,\u201d Slotkin, referring to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week, said in her response to the joint address to Congress.",
      "\u201cAs a Cold War kid, I\u2019m thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s,\u201d she added. \u201cTrump would have lost us the Cold War.\u201d",
      "Slotkin, who addressed the nation from Wyandotte, Michigan, framed her speech as a pitch for \u201cresponsible\u201d governing over \u201creckless\u201d leadership, arguing that Trump\u2019s agenda could spell economic doom for the country.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s not careful,\u201d she said, \u201che could walk us right into a recession.\u201d",
      "Slotkin posited that Trump\u2019s policies, as well as the sweeping cuts he has empowered billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk to oversee as part of a government efficiency initiative, would be destructive to most Americans.",
      "\u201cThe president talked a big game on the economy, but it\u2019s always important to read the fine print,\u201d she said. \u201cSo do his plans actually help Americans get ahead? Not even close. President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America, and to do that, he\u2019s going to make you pay in every part of your life. Grocery and home prices are going up, not down, and he hasn\u2019t laid out a credible plan to deal with either of those. His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber and cars and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers.\u201d",
      "Slotkin also had harsh words for Musk.",
      "\u201cIs there anyone in America,\u201d she asked, \u201cwho is comfortable with him and his gang of 20-year-olds using their own computer servers to poke through your tax returns, your health information and your bank accounts?",
      "\u201cWe need a more efficient government,\u201d she added. \u201cYou want to cut waste? I\u2019ll help you do it. But change doesn\u2019t need to be chaotic or make us less safe.\u201d",
      "Slotkin was one of the Democratic Party\u2019s few bright spots last year \u2014 a successful candidate for an open Senate seat in Michigan who outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris in the battleground state. A former House member who positioned herself as a more moderate voice in a party tilting left on cultural issues, Slotkin narrowly beat former Rep. Mike Rogers. Her victory has been held up in some corners of the party as a template for Democrats.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and I both won here in November,\u201d Slotkin said of Wyandotte. \u201cIt might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist across the United States, places where people believe that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids should do better. It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat, but it was never a big deal because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party.\u201d",
      "Slotkin also has emerged as one of the sharpest critics of Democratic messaging, telling reporters after last fall\u2019s election that Democrats would be wise to focus more on \u201cissues that keep people up at night,\u201d like their bank accounts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science, but talking about those issues plainly, not from the faculty lounge but from the assembly line, is, I think, a very important message,\u201d Slotkin said then. \u201cIt\u2019s not just what you\u2019re saying but from what place you are talking about those issues. \u2026 I personally think that identity politics needs to go the way of the dodo.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday night, Slotkin warned of an American democracy \u201cat risk when the president pits Americans against each other, when he demonizes those who are different and tells certain people they shouldn\u2019t be included.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 17:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "The case focuses on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s approval of a project to store spent nuclear fuel at a remote site in southwest Texas.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The shadow of the long-stalled proposed nuclear waste facility at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, loomed over Supreme Court proceedings Wednesday as the justices weighed a dispute over the federal government's decision to approve a temporary storage site in Texas.",
      "The nine justices heard oral arguments on whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission correctly allowed a company called Interim Storage Partners\u00a0to store spent nuclear fuel in Andrews County, Texas, for up to 40 years.",
      "The demand for the facility is largely because the Yucca Mountain project, which the federal government spent years and billions of dollars developing as a permanent storage site, has never been completed amid local opposition.",
      "Despite being effectively killed during the Obama administration, Yucca Mountain is by law still considered to be the only long-term solution for permanent storage.",
      "The question of whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the power to authorize a temporary, privately owned storage site that could effectively end up being permanent lingered in the background of the argument.",
      "\"It's a hole in the ground,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch said of Yucca Mountain. As a result, any interim storage site is not temporary \"in any meaningful sense,\" he added.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito noted that the 40-year license for the Texas site could potentially be renewed, maybe indefinitely.",
      "\"Where is the incentive to go forward, to do what Congress wanted to have done, which is to establish a permanent facility?\" he asked.",
      "But the fraught political question of where to store nuclear waste is not the key question before the court. It is possible  the court will dispose of the case by finding that Texas and others who challenged the proposal could not bring their claims because they had failed to intervene at an earlier stage, which several justices indicated was their view.",
      "If the court concludes the challengers can intervene, it is unclear how it would rule on the scope of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's authority.",
      "The agency maintains that under the Atomic Energy Act, it can order spent nuclear fuel to be transported across the country and held \u201ctemporarily\u201d at a different, privately owned site from where the fuel was used.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh pointed out that it has long been understood that the agency theoretically could authorize private temporary storage facilities that are not at the site of decommissioned reactors.",
      "Kavanaugh added that Congress, in a later 1982 law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, did not bar the agency from allowing such projects.",
      "\"Congress in 1982 had a chance to, was well aware of this issue, and did not expressly preclude this, and then that\u2019s been the way it\u2019s been for 50 years,\" he added.",

      "Texas officials say the NRC would allow up to 40,000 metric tons of waste to be stored above ground in the Permian Basin, which in addition to being a prominent oil field is also a source of water for surrounding communities.",

    "summary": "The White House is supposed to decide March 6 whether cuts to election security resources for state and local elections will be permanent.",
    "story": [
      "State and local election officials who have grown to rely on the federal government\u2019s cybersecurity assistance fear that the Trump administration may permanently block that aid by Thursday.",
      "Such funding, which began in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term and is funnelled through the country\u2019s top domestic security body, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), stopped in February. Those programs include free on-site and remote security testing of election machines and the websites that report election results, and ad hoc \u201csituation rooms\u201d where election officials can virtually gather and discuss security tactics in real time.",
      "\u201cTaking away that funding would be a very, very bad idea,\u201d said Howie Knapp, the executive director of South Carolina\u2019s State Election Commission,\u201d told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe all know as taxpayers there is government bloat enough, but this is protecting the core function of democracy,\u201d Knapp said. \u201cIf there\u2019s government cuts to be made, I would recommend they don\u2019t start with securing our nation\u2019s elections.\u201d",
      "CISA, which is under the Department of Homeland Security, plans to make a decision on the future of federal election security assistance by Thursday, according to a Feb. 14 agency memo obtained by NBC News. The memo was first reported by Wired.",
      "In an emailed statement, a DHS spokesperson confirmed CISA has \u201cstrategically paused all elections security activities.\u201d",
      "The potential cuts come amid a government-wide reduction in federal staffing and programming in Trump\u2019s first weeks back in office. At CISA alone, more than 140 employees have been laid off since Trump took office, a DHS spokesperson told NBC News.",
      "Most of the free election cybersecurity services that the federal government provides to states are funded by CISA but conducted through an organization called the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing & Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), which is run by the nonprofit Center for Internet Security. In a separate Feb. 14 letter to CISA obtained by NBC News (separate from the agency memo of the same day), the Department of Homeland Security ordered the Center for Internet Security\u00a0 to \u201cterminate\u201d those election services.",
      "Wesley Wilcox, the supervisor of elections at Marion County, Florida, is preparing for a special election on April 1 to fill the House seat vacated when former Rep. Mike Waltz left to become Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Wilcox said that the EI-ISAC\u2019s situation room has become an essential tool for securing elections.",
      "\u201cIf somebody in New York reports some malicious IP addresses, it gets spread out to us in real time to where all of us can block said IP address. There is nothing else like that,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhen we do this special election here in four weeks, there\u2019s a very real chance that there won\u2019t be a situation room,\u201d Wilcox, a registered Republican, said.",
      "The CISA memo last month, which assessed election security in the U.S., also included putting election security staffers on administrative leave as of Feb. 7.",
      "Election cybersecurity has become a crucial consideration since 2016, when Russian intelligence probed and, in some cases, hacked systems related to state election systems, as a Senate Intelligence Committee report found, though there\u2019s no evidence Russia had enough access to tamper with actual vote counts. Even if hackers can\u2019t change voting results, disrupting how Americans look up where to cast their ballot or falsifying websites that post early unofficial election results could be\u00a0 detrimental to public faith in democracy.",
      "Election officials appear to have little say in the matter. On Feb. 21, a coalition of most states\u2019 top election officials, the National Association of Secretaries of States (NASS), wrote an open letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem outlining the multiple federal security services that states have come to rely on, including intelligence briefings and help planning security exercises. The letter included an offer to meet with Noem or answer any questions about states\u2019 use of the program.",
      "DHS and Noem did not respond, a NASS spokesperson told NBC News.",
      "CISA\u2019s review appears to be prompted by a false claim popular among Trump allies that the agency is engaged in policing disinformation and censoring conservatives. The memo notes that the review is in accordance with one of the executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 20,\u00a0 \u201cRestoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship,\u201d which calls for a review of\u00a0 purported censorship during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.",
      "Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s influential collection of recommendations for the second Trump administration, characterizes CISA as an agency \u201cthat the Left has weaponized to censor speech and affect elections at the expense of securing the cyber domain and critical infrastructure, which are threatened daily.\u201d",
      "Trump disavowed Project 2025 while campaigning, but his transition team heavily relied on it to staff his administration.",
      "During Biden\u2019s presidency, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee routinely accused CISA of promoting \u201ccensorship,\u201d largely on the basis of a program created during the first Trump administration in which the agency would help local election officials flag social media companies about false claims on how and when to vote, or false claims that the practice of voting by mail was riddled with fraud. However, the CISA director under Biden\u2019s administration, Jen Easterly, ended that program.",
      "\u201cI need to ensure we are able to do our core mission, to reduce risk to critical infrastructure. And at this point in time, I do not think the risk of us dealing with social media platforms is worth any benefit, quite frankly,\u201d Easterly said in a podcast interview with tech journalist Kara Swisher in 2023. \u201cI made a decision not to do that. So we are not doing that. Local election officials can give that to the platforms themselves, and I think that\u2019s the right place for us to be.\u201d",
      "The agency has also at times published information about how elections are administered, as incorrect information was being spread elsewhere. Two weeks after he lost the 2020 election, Trump infamously fired its then director, Chris Krebs, over CISA running a \u201crumor versus reality\u201d blog that rebutted Trump\u2019s claims that the election had been hacked or stolen.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we have a voice,\u201d Wilcox, the Florida county election official, told NBC News. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to educate people involved in the decision-making process.\u201d"

      "President Emmanuel Macron said in a prime-time address to France on Wednesday night that Europe must be prepared to go it alone in defending Ukraine, without further assistance from the United States under the Trump administration.",
      "\"I\u00a0want to believe that the U.S. will stand by our side, but we have to be ready for that not to be the case,\" Macron said from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris.",
      "He continued, \"Whether we reach peace in Ukraine soon or not, we need to be able to recognize the Russian threat and better defend ourselves in order to deter such attacks. Whatever happens, we need to provide ourselves with more arms, more equipment in terms of defense, to provide a dissuasive force.\"",
      "Macron warned that Ukraine cannot be abandoned in its fight against Russia because, he said: \"Who can believe that in this context, Russia will stop at Ukraine? Russia has become, and will remain, a threat to France and Europe.\u201d",
      "The French president made clear that France and other European countries must take concrete steps, including investing in defense and military capabilities, to protect the security of their nations and Ukraine's.",
      "\u201cTo remain a spectator in this dangerous world would be crazy,\" Macron said. \"The initiatives for peace are going in the right direction, and I welcome them, and we need to continue to help Ukrainians resist until they can negotiate with Russia a solid and lasting peace for themselves and for all of us. The path to peace cannot be achieved by abandoning Ukraine.\"",
      "Macron reiterated remarks made by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the weekend at a defense summit in London that Europe may have to put boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "\"Our forces will be there if necessary to guarantee peace, not before a peace agreement is signed,\" Macron said Wednesday. \"We will continue to meet with allies to move toward the signing of such an agreement. It's a plan for a lasting, solid, verifiable peace agreement, which we're working on with European partners and Ukraine.\"",
      "Macron and Starmer have teamed up in a desperate attempt to heal American-Ukraine ties after last Friday\u2019s extraordinary shouting match at the White House between President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance. Both Starmer and Macron have sought to balance their yearslong outspoken support for Zelenskyy with the need to retain good relations with the United States.",
      "Teeing up his speech, Macron said on X that it came in a \u201cmoment of great uncertainty, when the world is facing its greatest challenges.\u201d Starmer told British lawmakers Wednesday that he had spoken with Trump three times since he visited the White House last week.",
      "This Anglo-French mission has at times appeared onerous.",
      "After the Oval Office spat, Trump continued to berate Zelenskyy on social media, with the president and some of his team suggesting that Ukraine\u2019s leader could or should be ousted from office. The administration then paused aid to Ukraine, a vital lifeline holding back the Kremlin war machine.",
      "The aid freeze is a serious blow not just to Ukraine, whose biggest military backer is the U.S., but also Europe, which is years away from being able to defend itself against Russia without Washington.",
      "Things shifted Tuesday when Trump said during his joint address to Congress that he had received \u201can important letter\u201d from Zelenskyy  stating the Ukrainian president's desire for peace and his gratitude for U.S. support.",
      "Zelenskyy confirmed the thrust of this missive in an X post on Tuesday, calling the White House clash \u201cregrettable,\u201d thanking Trump\u2019s team and saying he was ready to sign a deal giving Washington access to Ukraine\u2019s rich mineral wealth.",

      "Ukraine is reluctant to sign a ceasefire without \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d \u2014 meaning protection from Europe and the U.S. against Russia violating the truce, as it has done before.",
      "Supporters and independent analysts worry that a ceasefire would allow Russia to regroup \u2014 as well as showing Russian President Vladimir Putin that attacking a European country is not only permitted, but rewarded.",
      "Zelenskyy once stood firm in demanding these security guarantees. But now facing pressure from Moscow and Washington, he suggested on X that he would accept a minerals deal that was merely a looser \u201cstep toward\u201d such promises."

      "Parker Posey's Southern accent on Season Three of \"The White Lotus\" has everyone in tears \u2014 including TODAY's Craig Melvin.",
      "Posey, who portrays Victoria Ratliff on the hit HBO show, pulled out her favorite phrases to say with her signature Southern twang on TODAY March 5, leading Craig to burst out into laughter mid-interview.",
      "\"It starts with the dialogue. There's such funny words like, I love 'tsunami!'\" Posey said, in her exaggerated North Carolina accent, before also giving words like \"Buddhism\" a go.",
      "Craig, a South Carolina native himself, couldn't contain his laughter, and several crew members could be heard giggling off camera.",
      "Posey says she fine-tuned her accent while working on movies like \"Best in Show\" with director Christopher Guest, which easily translated during lines like, \"Piper, no!\" when she's talking to her daughter on \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "\"We just played on that, so it just started to grow and grow,\" she said.",
      "\"I love Southern women characters ... so being able to be this dramatic and funny is just so juicy and fun to do. And, of course, Mike White wrote it so (well),\" Posey added.",
      "She said she watched the Bravo reality TV show \"Southern Charm\" to prepare for the role, and her spin on a Durham, North Carolina, accent has taken over the internet.",
      "\"This is just \u2014 just a little bit of the feedback,\" Craig said as he read social media posts on TODAY. \"'Parker Posey's accent is, hands-down, one of the best parts of \"White Lotus.\"' 'The voice that Parker Posey is doing in \"White Lotus\" belongs in the Louvre.'\"",
      "\"They want to hang the accent!\" he said.",
      "Posey took the time to teach Craig a traditional Thai greeting that she learned while living in Thailand for seven months filming the third season of the show, before telling him about what it was like to read the script for Season Three for the first time.",
      "\"I was so hooked, and I was so taken by the eighth episode, I forgot who died,\" she said, referring to the show's finale episode. \"It was so adrenalized and so stressed out that I forgot what happened.\"",
      "\"Because the characters are so well written, too, and I really cared about them,\" she added. \"I don't like all that violent stuff. I didn't want anyone to die, but, it happens.\"",
      "While the Season Three finale isn't until April 6, an exclusive clip from the show's upcoming fourth episode aired on TODAY, which might provide some clues toward the show's plot.",
      "In the clip, Posey's character, Victoria, is sitting with her husband, Tim, played by Jason Isaacs, and her daughter, Piper, played by Sarah Catherine Hook, looking at menus and discussing an event they just came from.",
      "\"Well, that was stressful,\" Victoria says with a chuckle. \"I thought I was going to have a grand mal seizure. What was that? That was \u2014 that was a convention for con men and tax cheats.\"",
      "Piper quips back: \"I'm sure you all cheat on your taxes, Mom.\"",
      "\"Well, not so badly that we have to leave the country,\" Victoria replies.",
      "The subtext, of course, is that Victoria's husband does have some financial troubles: His business partner Kenny is being investigated by the feds for money laundering in Brunei, and Kenny is sure Tim is implicated too.",
      "But the rest of the Ratliff family is unaware of the FBI's warrant out to search Tim's office, as Tim made the family secure their cellular devices in a bag so they can be as mindful and present as possible at the resort in Thailand.",
      "The full fallout from the deal remains to be seen on the show, which is keeping fans on their toes ahead of the fourth episode, which airs Sunday, March 9.",
      "One person who won't be watching? Posey.",
      "\"I haven't watched it \u2014 I lived it, and I loved it,\" she told Craig. \"We had a great time in Thailand.\"",
      "Posey said she doesn't watch herself, but she plans to watch her season of \"The White Lotus\" once a little more time has passed.",
      "\"I'll watch it in the summer, when there's a little bit of a break,\" she said."

We didn\u2019t plan anything big at all because we didn\u2019t want any kind of strain, any kind of tension, any kind of commotion, so we planned it cleverly and carefully.

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is engaging in direct talks with Hamas over the release of U.S. hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Wednesday.",
      "President Donald Trump believes the dialogue is part of\u00a0a \"good-faith effort to do what\u2019s right for the American people,\" Leavitt said at a White House news briefing.",
      "\"There are American lives at stake,\" she added, noting that Israel had been consulted.",
      "The development comes after the six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended Saturday with no extension of peace negotiations in sight. It marks the first time the U.S. has held direct talks with the group, which it has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "Axios first reported the talks between the U.S. and Hamas.",
      "Asked whether the scope of the talks included Trump's proposal to take over Gaza, Leavitt said she would not go into details at the briefing and referred questions to the State Department.",
      "Initially, the idea for a second phase of a ceasefire included the release of more hostages by Hamas in return for Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian territory, with the aim of ending the war.",
      "But with no talks continuing, Israel reinstated a halt in the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza after the initial phase of the ceasefire ended. Hamas then accused Israel of violating their agreement by \u201cevading the commitment to end the war and withdraw completely from Gaza.\u201d",
      "Last weekend, Israel approved a plan from the\u00a0U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0that would have continued the first stage of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover instead of proceeding to the second phase of peace talks.",
      "Witkoff's plan called for the release of half of the\u00a0remaining hostages, including the bodies of those who have died, on the first day, and the remaining hostages once a permanent ceasefire deal is reached, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.",
      "But Hamas rejected the proposal, saying it didn't honor the original, multiphased ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these positions by the United States strengthened the position of the Zionist right within the government and pushed for taking punitive steps, including closing the crossings in this manner and using the starvation policy against the people of the Gaza Strip,\" the group\u2019s spokesman, Hazem Qassem, said in a statement Sunday.",
      "National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Sunday that Israel has \"negotiated in good faith since the beginning of this administration to ensure the release of hostages held captive by Hamas terrorists.\"",
      "Hughes added that the U.S. will support Israel's decision on next steps \"given Hamas has indicated it\u2019s no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire.\"",
      "On Monday, Netanyahu warned Hamas in remarks before the Knesset, Israel's legislature, that if the group didn't release more hostages, \"there will be consequences beyond your imagination. We are preparing for the next stages of the campaign \u2014 not everything is visible, and that\u2019s a good thing.\"",
      "The initial ceasefire was announced by the Biden administration in January just days before Trump's inauguration. It required a pause of Israel's military operations in Gaza and the release of both living and dead hostages held there in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump is used to shocking critics with his approach to foreign policy. But his hard-line Ukraine tactics have this week unnerved some of his political allies on the far right, too.",
      "The White House this week paused aid to Ukraine, which is fighting off Russia\u2019s invasion, after Trump and Vice President JD Vance publicly berated President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Dutch anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders \u2014 often referred to as the \u201cDutch Trump\u201d because of his flamboyant blond hair and anti-immigration politics \u2014 said Saturday that he stood by Ukraine \u201cwith conviction.\u201d He reacted to Trump\u2019s Oval Office clash with Zelenskyy by posting on X that it was \u201cfascinating TV, but not necessarily the best way to end the war, gentlemen.\u201d",
      "Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s far-right National Rally party, called the decision to halt aid \u201cbrutal,\u201d \u201ccruel\u201d and reprehensible,\u201d speaking to the Le Figaro newspaper Tuesday.",
      "And Britain\u2019s Nigel Farage, a longtime friend and ally of Trump\u2019s, said Tuesday that Vance was \u201cwrong, wrong, wrong\u201d after the vice president appeared to ridicule the idea of Britain sending peacekeepers to Ukraine.",
      "Only Britain and France have offered to send such a force, but Vance denied he was referring to those countries when he derided he idea of \u201c20,000 troops from some random country that hasn\u2019t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d",
      "Cue uproar in Britain, which lost 457 and 179 troops fighting U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan respectively.",
      "The comments are notable because these are Trump\u2019s natural allies in geopolitics: insurgents attacking the political establishment from the right with a mix of populism, extreme opposition to immigration and, critics say, authoritarianism.",
      "Last month, Le Pen and Wilders were among a clutch of hard-right leaders who gathered for the \u201cMake Europe Great Again\u201d summit in Madrid. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a truly global tipping point,\u201d Le Pen told the audience. \u201cHurricane Trump is sweeping across the United States.\u201d",
      "Wilders called the American president \u201ca brother in arms.\u201d",
      "But the criticism also highlights the complex, confusing and often seemingly contradictory web of interests and viewpoints on the continent when it comes to Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Like many far-right figures in Europe, Le Pen, Farage and Wilders have all faced past accusations of being too close to the Kremlin \u2014 which they have all denied.",
      "They have also displayed varying degrees of skepticism when it comes to supporting Ukraine: Le Pen said she would oppose the use of French long-range missiles being used by Kyiv, Farage has argued that ending the war requires \u201cconcessions on both sides,\u201d and Wilders\u2019 People\u2019s Party, which leads the current government, opposed aid being given to the country at all.",
      "But these opinions seem to be shifting.",
      "Le Pen is trying to distance herself from her party\u2019s far-right roots, presenting a more mainstream image ahead of a 2027 presidential election she may well win. In a speech Saturday, she paid tribute to the \u201cUkrainian people\u201d who \u201cheroically resist the indefensible Russian aggression,\u201d Le Figaro reported. She said the crisis was a consequence of\u00a0 Europe\u2019s \u201csubmission\u201d to the U.S.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilders\u2019 People\u2019s Party has pivoted not only to supporting Ukraine aid \u2014 but also to the idea that Europe needs to gain military independence from the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe ourselves must stand up for the safety of Europe and the Netherlands,\u201d the party posted on X after the Oval Office argument. \u201cWe will continue our support for Ukraine unabated and must invest more in defense.\u201d",
      "Farage, meanwhile, despite his friendship with Trump, has found a political foe in his adviser Elon Musk, who said Farage \u201cdid not have what it takes\u201d to lead Britain\u2019s Reform UK party.",
      "His criticism of Vance appeared to come from a different place, however, echoing an outraged supporter base that saw the vice president as betraying British troops killed fighting American wars.",
      "\u201cSHOW RESPECT,\u201d the Sun tabloid wrote Wednesday. \u201cBrit heroes hit back at Vance after he forgot UK\u2019s 636 Iraq & Afghan war dead.\u201d",

      "The United States and Israel have rejected a Gaza Strip reconstruction plan that sees the devastated enclave being fully rebuilt without displacing Palestinians, as envisioned under President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to transform the territory into the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "Under the $53 billion reconstruction plan proposed by Egypt at an emergency summit in Cairo on Tuesday, Gaza, which has been largely destroyed in Israel's nearly year-and-a-half military offensive in the enclave, would be rebuilt over the span of under six years.",
      "Artificial intelligence-labelled images, released as part of a version of the plan agreed at a summit that included representatives from across the 22-member Arab League, show modern housing developments and busy city streets, with the document outlining plans for tourist destinations, including resorts.",
      "The proposal, which also includes plans for a commercial harbor and an airport, suggests it be funded by a variety of international sources, including the United Nations and international financial organizations, as well as foreign and private sector investments.",
      "Egyptian President\u00a0Abdel-Fattah\u00a0el-Sissi\u00a0said the proposal would enable the reconstruction of Gaza while ensuring Palestinians are able to \"stay on their land without displacement.\"",
      "The White House swiftly dismissed the plan, with National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes saying late Tuesday that the proposal did not \"address the reality that Gaza is current uninhabitable.\" He said Trump stood by his \"vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" according to Reuters.",
      "According to local officials, more than 48,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip as a result of Israeli shelling and bombing. Most of the population has also been displaced and more than half of the infrastructure destroyed, including hospitals and schools, according to estimate from the United Nations.",
      "Trump's proposal for the U.S. to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" sparked outrage across the region and around the world last month, with some analysts warning that his plan to see Palestinians at least temporarily and possibly permanently displaced was tantamount to ethnic cleansing.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry echoed Trump's proposal Tuesday, saying it provided an \"opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will.\"",
      "\"This should be encouraged,\" it added.",
      "While Israeli officials have repeatedly suggested Trump's plan would give Palestinians in Gaza the ability to leave the enclave freely \u2014 something they have not been able to do under Israel and Egypt's nearly two-decade-long blockade on the territory \u2014 it has not expanded on whether they would just as easily be able to regain access to the territory.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry also condemned the Egyptian proposal's plan for a committee of independent Palestinian technocrats to govern Gaza in preparation for the eventual return of the Palestinian Authority, accusing the Fatah-controlled government body of \"corruption\" and \"support for terrorism.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas\u00a0commended the reconstruction plan in a statement, also thanking Trump for his efforts surrounding the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Hamas, which has run the enclave for almost two decades and is a bitter rival of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the proposal embraced by Arab nations in a statement Tuesday."

      "\u201cIt remains to be seen if this will result in charges,\u201d added Abdalla, who also starred in \u201cUnited 93\u201d and \u201cThe Day of the Jackal.\u201d He added that the right to protest was \u201cunder attack\u201d in the the United Kingdom.",
      "Abdalla was among tens of thousands of people who attended the demonstration, which was held the day after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal to pause the war in the Gaza Strip, which has claimed the lives of more than 48,000 people, according to health officials in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas terrorist attacks Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The Metropolitan Police confirmed to NBC News via email that it had arrested 77 people on suspicion of breaching protest conditions after some of them broke through a police line that day. It added that 21 people had been charged so far.",
      "As part of the \u201congoing investigation,\u201d the force said it had \u201cinvited a further eight people to be interviewed under caution at a police station.\u201d British police typically do not confirm the identity of anyone under investigation.",
      "Abdalla, 44, has attended several pro-Palestinian rallies in the past and has publicly called for a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Addressing the crowds at the Jan. 18 rally, Abdalla said, \u201cTomorrow phase one of this ceasefire begins. It remains to be seen if the ceasefire will hold, or if the blood shed since it was announced augurs what it will become.\u201d",
      "In February, he was one of the signatories to an open letter written to the BBC by the advocacy group, Artists for Palestine UK, which criticized the broadcaster for pulling a documentary on Gaza\u2019s children.",
      "The Palestine Coalition, the activist group that organized the rally, condemned the letter sent to Abdalla in a statement issued Monday, accusing police of carrying out an \u201capparently coordinated attack against the Palestine solidarity movement.\u201d",
      "The force, it said, was \u201cendeavoring to halt public protest on the issue through harassment of those involved in the movement, and through increasingly draconian restrictions on demonstrations.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu railed against his critics and accused the media of working with the \u201cdeep state\u201d as he rejected the establishment of a court-appointed inquiry into the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks.",
      "In a speech at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Netanyahu, without providing any evidence, suggested the findings would be \u201cpredetermined\u201d and told lawmakers it was \u201cimportant and crucial to investigate in depth the events of Oct. 7 and what led up to it,\u201d but  thought a court-led probe would be biased.",
      "\u201cWhat do you think? That we\u2019re children?\u201d he shouted into a microphone as some his fellow politicians jeered and shouted at him during Monday night's debate.",
      "Israel\u2019s High Court of Justice ruled in December that Netanyahu\u2019s government\u00a0should hold a Cabinet hearing on whether to form a state commission of inquiry\u00a0to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Hamas-led attacks, looking at why the country\u2019s military was unable to prevent the deadly assault.",
      "But it has since agreed to requests from the government to delay updates to the court about its stance on the creation of such an inquiry.",
      "Lawmakers, including former war Cabinet minister Benny Gantz, have long called for a state commission to be set up.",
      "Banging on the podium in the Knesset, Netanyahu acknowledged that the \u201cpublic demands the truth\u201d about the Hamas attacks and he called for the formation of a commission that would \u201cinvestigate everything,\u201d including alleged leaks from Cabinet meetings and confidential parliamentary sessions.",
      "He went on to blast the media, accusing news outlets of  \u201cfull cooperation with the deep state\u201d and of creating \u201cscandals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe cooperation between the bureaucracy in the deep state and the media didn\u2019t work in the United States, and it won\u2019t work here,\u201d he said, aping the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the idea that clandestine networks operate within governments, acting to manipulate or control policy.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s rivals were quick to condemn his comments. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said the events of Oct. 7 would \u201calways belong\u201d to the Israeli prime minister, adding that \u201cthere was never a government here that had so many reasons to ask for forgiveness.\u201d",
      "Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the debate reflected a \u201ctotal disconnect\u201d by a \u201cdisastrous government.\u201d",
      "After conducting its own investigation into the deadly attacks, Israel\u2019s military acknowledged last month that it had misjudged Hamas\u2019 intentions and underestimated the militant group\u2019s capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.",
      "More than 48,000 people have been killed in Israel's assault on Gaza since then, according to health officials in the enclave.",
      "However, many Israelis believe the failures surrounding the attacks extend beyond the military and Netanyahu has faced calls to take responsibility for his country\u2019s apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "At least 65% of Israelis said they believed the most appropriate method to investigate the attacks was a State Commission of Inquiry, according to a recent poll conducted by the Jerusalem-based Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research.",
      "Surveyed between from Jan. 28 to Feb. 2, just 17% of the 604 Jewish and 151 Arab respondents said they supported the idea of a government-appointed commission of inquiry.",
      "Netanyahu has nonetheless maintained that he will answer difficult questions, but only after the war that has consumed the Middle East for almost a-year-and-a-half comes to an end.",
      "His outburst came amid growing fears over the future of the fragile ceasefire between his government and Hamas, and as Israel faces mounting criticism for halting the entry of aid and goods into the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar doubled down on that decision Tuesday, blaming Hamas for the pause \u2014 which came as families across Gaza marked the month of Ramadan \u2014 after the militant group refused to accept a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

      "The air quality data had been published on AirNow, a website run by the Environmental Protection Agency, and ZephAir, a mobile app managed by the State Department.",
      "The website was offline as of Wednesday, while data is no longer available on the app for numerous cities including China\u2019s Beijing, India\u2019s Mumbai and Thailand\u2019s Bangkok, all of which were among the world\u2019s most polluted cities on Wednesday according to IQAir, a Swiss air quality-monitoring company.",
      "Outdoor air pollution caused an estimated 4.2 million\u00a0premature deaths\u00a0worldwide\u00a0in 2019, according to the World Health Organization, most of them in low- and middle-income countries where residents lack access to reliable air quality data.",
      "A 2022 study found that air-quality monitoring by U.S. embassies \u201csignificantly\u201d lowered pollutant levels in host cities and raised local awareness of environmental issues.",
      "The program has been \u201cincredibly important\u201d for regions of the world without access to \u201chigh-quality, timely and credible monitoring,\u201d said Andrea La Nauze, co-author of the study and an associate professor who specializes in environmental economics at Deakin University in Australia.",
      "The data led to improvements in local air quality, resulting in an average of 303 fewer premature deaths in each city and generating $127 million per year in savings associated with lower mortality, she said in an email.",
      "The study noted ancillary evidence that the monitoring program and the resulting improvements in air quality reduced costs for the State Department, which provides diplomats and other overseas employees with hazard pay if they are working in highly polluted places.",
      "Monitoring began in 2008 with a pilot program at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where a device installed on its rooftop recorded levels of PM2.5, an air pollutant associated with premature mortality and heart attacks. The readings were then shared in real time online.",
      "The program made international headlines in 2010 when its PM2.5 reading for Beijing surged past 500, about 20 times the upper limit recommended by the\u00a0World Health Organization, in what the embassy labeled \u201ccrazy bad\u201d pollution.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. global air quality monitoring program provided an independent data source to help us understand the air pollution situation in Beijing during the time period,\u201d said Steve Hung-Lam Yim, director of the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.",
      "Though the program initially drew the ire of the Chinese government, the U.S. embassy\u2019s hourly release of data compelled China to set up its own PM2.5 monitoring system in its capital in 2011.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen an initiative of the U.S. government have such an immediate, dramatic impact in a country,\u201d Gary Locke, the U.S. ambassador to China from 2011 to 2014, was quoted as saying in 2013.",
      "China has since acknowledged that Beijing was experiencing \u201cpersistent, large-scale, high-concentration severe air pollution.\u201d In 2014, Chinese authorities announced that the country would launch a \u201cwar against pollution.\u201d",
      "Over the following years, the city of Beijing promoted alternatives to smog-producing coal and shut down more than 2,600 manufacturing companies associated with pollution, among other measures.

      "A senior Chinese environmental official said last month that China aimed to effectively eliminate severe air pollution by the end of this year, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",

      "CK Hutchison, a conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, has agreed in principle to sell its controlling stake in a unit that operates the two ports to a consortium that includes the U.S. asset manager BlackRock, the companies said Tuesday.",
      "President Donald Trump had argued that the Chinese-backed ports, one each at the canal\u2019s Pacific and Atlantic entrances, posed a national security threat because they gave the Chinese military potential control of the strategically vital canal.",
      "Though CK Hutchison said the proposed sale was unrelated to politics, Trump touted it as a victory in his Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress.",
      "\u201cMy administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal.\u201d",

      "\u201cI would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,\u201d Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a news release.",
      "The news sent CK Hutchison up almost 22% Wednesday on Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index.",
      "Control over the Panama Canal has been a high-profile focus of the Trump administration, with Marco Rubio making Panama part of his first foreign trip as secretary of state.",
      "Hutchison Ports won the rights to manage the two Panama Canal ports in 1997 in a\u00a0bidding process that was described as fair and nondiscriminatory\u00a0by U.S. officials at the time. In 2021, its contract was extended until 2047.",
      "Though the two ports sit at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, ships do not have to pass through them to enter. Other ports along the canal are operated by companies from Taiwan, Singapore and the U.S.",
      "The ports serve mainly to handle cargo, while the canal itself is run by the Panama Canal Authority, an independent Panamanian government agency.",
      "Though CK Hutchison is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, Trump administration officials had argued that it was subject to control by Beijing, which has been tightening its grip on the city.",
      "The potential sale, which is subject to regulatory approval, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal."

One man had minor injuries to his arm where the juvenile male dolphin grazed his back and shoulder, but all three fishermen and the dolphin were otherwise uninjured.",

      "The men alerted New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency and were directed to a boat ramp an hour away, where workers waited to help the dolphin.

      "BEIJING \u2014 China is keeping its economic growth target at \u201caround 5%\u201d for 2025 despite a looming trade war with the United States and other headwinds.",
      "The target for GDP growth was announced Wednesday in a report being presented by Premier Li Qiang at the opening session of the National People\u2019s Congress, the annual meeting of China\u2019s legislature. It reflects the government\u2019s hopes to stabilize but not supercharge growth in challenging economic times.",
      "The IMF has projected China\u2019s economy will grow 4.6% this year, down from 5% in 2024, according to Chinese government statistics.",
      "\u201cA target of around 5% is well aligned with our mid- and long-term development goals and underscores our resolve to meet difficulties head-on and strive hard to deliver,\u201d the government report said.",
      "The report offered some details on previously announced plans to step up stimulus for the sluggish economy this year. It said the government would adopt a \u201cmore proactive fiscal policy,\u201d including an increase in deficit spending from 3% to 4% of GDP, or the size of the overall economy.",
      "It said the government would issue 1.3 trillion yuan ($180 billion) in ultra-long term bonds, up from 1 trillion yuan last year.",
      "Across-the-board tariffs imposed on Chinese products by U.S. President Donald Trump pose the latest threat to an economy already weighed down by a prolonged real estate slump and sluggish consumer spending and private business investment.",
      "China\u2019s ruling Communist Party signaled in December that it would boost stimulus this year. The U.S. tariffs have made that task more urgent, because they could crimp sales to one of China\u2019s major export markets.",
      "At the same time, Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants to wean the economy off its long-running dependence on the highly indebted real estate market. He is pushing economic resources into developing a more innovative, high-tech economy \u2014 and with growing restrictions on U.S. technology exports to China, one that isn\u2019t beholden to other countries for the most powerful semiconductors and other electronic components.",
      "That has remained the overarching long-term economic goal of the Communist Party, though it has enacted various measures since September in a possible shift in emphasis toward shoring up growth in the short term.",
      "The government has been giving rebates to consumers who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones and to businesses that upgrade their machinery and equipment. The party also announced in December that the central bank would shift its monetary policy from \u201cprudent\u201d to \u201cmoderately loose\u201d for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "The government, following the party\u2019s leadership, is expected to borrow more this year, spend more on the rebate program and possibly increase pensions and health care benefits. The question is whether it will be enough to stabilize the economy and reach its target for growth."

      "A 25% U.S. tariff on almost all goods imported from Canada and Mexico took effect Tuesday just after midnight, along with an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The three countries together accounted for\u00a0more than 40% of total U.S. imports last year and are also the top three U.S. export markets.",
      "China will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, its government said, while Canada vowed tariffs of up to 25%. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced her country would enact countermeasures Sunday in response to the U.S. tariffs, adding that they would include both \u201ctariff and nontariff measures.\u201d",
      "The new Chinese levies, which take effect on March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables and dairy and fish products. Chinese state media had reported earlier that U.S. agricultural products would be targeted.",
      "China says that the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world\u2019s two largest economies and that they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,\u201d Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cPressure, threats and coercion are not the right way to engage with China. If the U.S. attempts to exert extreme pressure on China, it is simply targeting the wrong country and miscalculating its moves.\u201d",
      "Lin also said that China had \u201ctaken strong measures\u201d to help stem the international flow of fentanyl, which President Donald Trump has cited as justification for the tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, and that the United States was using fentanyl as an excuse to wage a trade war.",
      "In addition to the new tariffs, China added 10 U.S. companies to its \u201cunreliable entity\u201d list and 15 to its export control list, mostly defense and intelligence firms with little exposure to the Chinese economy.",
      "Beijing is also filing a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the new 10% tariff, as it did in response to a previous 10% tariff that Trump imposed on Chinese goods starting Feb. 4.",
      "The combined 20% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods comes on top of tariffs Trump imposed during his first term that were maintained and in some cases sharply increased by President Joe Biden.",
      "Canada said it would move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155\u00a0billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) in U.S. goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled.",
      "Tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, he said.",
      "\u201cBecause of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cTariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.\u201d",
      "Trump, who had been threatening tariffs against Canada and Mexico since November, had accused them of failing to stem the international flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.",
      "While precursor chemicals for fentanyl are known to be shipped from China to Mexico, where they are processed into the deadly opioid that is then smuggled into the United States, Canada says it has virtually no role in the international flow of fentanyl.",
      "According to U.S. customs data, only 0.2% of the more than 20,000 pounds of fentanyl seized at the U.S. border in the 2024 fiscal year came from Canada.",
      "Trudeau said Canada had nonetheless stepped up its drug enforcement efforts, resulting in a further drop of 97% in fentanyl seizures from Canada from December to January, to 0.03 pounds.",
      "The tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which Trump issued in an executive order he signed Feb. 1, had been put on hold for 30 days after the leaders of both countries announced moves to tighten border security. They also include a 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports.",
      "U.S. stocks tumbled Monday after Trump said the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go ahead as planned, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 650 points, or 1.48%, and the S&P 500 dropping 1.76% for its worst day so far this year.",
      "In Asia, Japan led declines in markets around the region with stocks falling almost 2%, CNBC reported. Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong were muted.",

      "Though China spared U.S. agriculture in its response to the first 10% tariff, \u201cTrump\u2019s impatient tariff offensive may be changing the calculus\u201d and the U.S. farming sector \u201cshould start to feel the pinch,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing.",
      "\u201cSounds like it\u2019s telling the U.S. that \u2018we\u2019re really going to hit you hard if you don\u2019t stop,\u2019\u201d he said in an email.",
      "In Canada, meanwhile, retaliation against U.S. tariffs could also extend to its individual provinces. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Monday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press NOW\u201d that Canada would \u201crespond like they\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "He said he was prepared to retaliate by cutting off the transmission of electricity from his province to the United States, as well as shipments of nickel, which \u201cwill shut down manufacturing because 50% of the nickel you use is coming out of Ontario.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to the American people that your president has decided to do this,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI apologize, but he\u2019s giving us no choice.\u201d"

      "The White House said the defense assistance was being reviewed to make sure it was contributing to the administration\u2019s goal of being \u201cfocused on peace.\u201d",
      "Military analysts say that withholding Ukraine\u2019s defensive lifeblood will be \u201ccrippling\u201d in a matter of months as it tries to hold back the Russian war machine and defend its cities being bombed nightly.",
      "It will also deepen the chasm between the Trump administration and Washington\u2019s longtime European allies, who are already scrambling to fill the void left by a U.S. government pursuing a rapprochement with their chief antagonist in Moscow.",
      "Michael McFaul, Washington\u2019s ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama, likened the move to President Franklin D. Roosevelt losing \u201cthe 1940 election to an America Firster who then had the U.S. switch sides in World War II. ... We\u2019d all be speaking German now.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why this current moment feels like,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThree years into a war between an imperialist dictatorship with autocratic allies and a democracy, Trump just switched sides.\u201d"

      "Children as young as 1 are being raped and sexually assaulted by armed forces in Sudan, where a bitter civil war has been raging for almost two years, according to a new report by the United Nations children\u2019s agency.",
      "The first comprehensive account illustrating how mass sexual violence is being wielded as a weapon of war against children inside the northeast African nation found that more than 200 children had been raped since the start of last year, although the authors stressed that this was only a small fraction of the total number of cases.",
      "\u201cChildren as young as one being raped by armed men should shock anyone to their core and compel immediate action,\u201d UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement Monday.",
      "Calling it \u201can abhorrent violation of international law and could constitute a war crime,\u201d she added that \u201cit must stop.\u201d",
      "Four 1-year-olds were among those who survived the assaults and another 16 survivors were children under the age of 5, the report said. Of the reported 221 cases of child rape, 66% of the victims were girls, while 33% were boys, it added.",
      "The number of violations recorded against Sudanese children was 16% higher in 2024 than in 2023, which had already seen an increase of 473% from 2022 when the war broke out, the report said.",
      "The report contained distressing details that highlighted the gravity of the situation on the ground.",
      "\u201cAfter nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her,\u201d read one testimony by Omnia, an adult female survivor who was held by armed men in a room with other women and girls.",
      "Nearly two years of war between Sudan's armed forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler,\u00a0Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy,\u00a0Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, have left more than 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister\u00a0Abdalla Hamdok\u00a0in 2021.",
      "But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "More than 12 million people have been displaced and tens of thousands of people have been reportedly killed, according to the U.N.",
      "While both sides have been accused of extensive human rights violations, a U.N. fact-finding mission in October found that the RSF was responsible for committing sexual violence on a large scale in areas under its control, including gang rapes, abductions and sexual slavery.",
      "In January, the United States determined that the RSF had committed genocide in areas under its control.",
      "UNICEF, which has been providing safe spaces for children through emergency response rooms set up by local activists, said in the report that the outcome of sexual crimes against children was \u201cdevastating\u201d due to the fact that victims have \u201cfew places to turn to for medical help.\u201d",
      "Women and girls are fleeing their homes and families to other cities where they end up becoming internally displaced and continue to face high risk of sexual violence, the report added.",
      "\u201cWidespread sexual violence in Sudan has instilled terror in people, especially children,\u201d Russell said, calling on all parties to the conflict to put an end to the violations.",
      "\u201cThese scars of war are immeasurable and long-lasting,\u201d she added."

      "Several senior Russian missile specialists have visited Iran over the past year as the Islamic Republic has deepened its defense cooperation with Moscow, a Reuters review of travel records and employment data indicates.",
      "The seven weapons experts were booked to travel from Moscow to Tehran aboard two flights on April 24 and September 17 last year, according to documents detailing the two group bookings as well as the passenger manifest for the second flight.",
      "The booking records include the men\u2019s passport numbers, with six of the seven having the prefix \u201c20.\u201d That denotes a passport used for official state business, issued to government officials on foreign work trips and military personnel stationed abroad, according to an edict published by the Russian government and a document on the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s website.",
      "Reuters was unable to determine what the seven were doing in Iran.",
      "A senior Iranian defense ministry official said Russian missile experts had made multiple visits to Iranian missile production sites last year, including two underground facilities, with some of the visits taking place in September. The official, who requested anonymity to discuss security matters, didn\u2019t identify the sites.",
      "A Western defense official, who monitors Iran\u2019s defense cooperation with Russia and also requested anonymity, said an unspecified number of Russian missile experts visited an Iranian missile base, about 9 miles west of the port of Amirabad on Iran\u2019s Caspian Sea coast, in September.",
      "Reuters couldn\u2019t establish if the visitors referred to by the officials included the Russians on the two flights.",
      "The seven Russians identified by Reuters all have senior military backgrounds, with two ranked colonel and two lieutenant-colonel, according to a review of Russian databases containing information about citizens\u2019 jobs or places of work, including tax, phone and vehicle records.",
      "Two are experts in air-defense missile systems, three specialize in artillery and rocketry, while one has a background in advanced weapons development and another has worked at a missile-testing range, the records showed. Reuters was unable to establish whether all are still working in those roles as the employment data ranged from 2021 to 2024.",
      "Their flights to Tehran came at a precarious time for Iran, which found itself drawn into a tit-for-tat battle with arch-foe Israel that saw both sides mount military strikes on each other in April and October.",
      "Reuters contacted all the men by phone: five of them denied they had been to Iran, denied they worked for the military or both, while one declined to comment and one hung up.",
      "Iran\u2019s defense and foreign ministries declined to comment for this article, as did the public relations office of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite force that oversees Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program. The Russian defense ministry didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cooperation between the two countries, whose leaders signed a 20-year military pact in Moscow in January, has already influenced Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, with large numbers of Iranian-designed Shahed drones deployed on the battlefield.",
      "Rockets and artillery",
      "The flight booking information for the seven travellers was shown to Reuters by Hooshyaran-e Vatan, a group of activist hackers opposed to the Iranian government. The hackers said the seven were travelling with VIP status.",
      "Reuters corroborated the information with the Russian passenger manifest for the September flight, which was provided by a source with access to Russian state databases. The news agency was unable to access a manifest for the earlier flight, so couldn\u2019t verify that the five Russian specialists booked on it actually made the trip.",
      "Denis Kalko, 48, and 46-year-old Vadim Malov were among the five Russian weapons experts whose seats were booked as a group on the April flight, the records showed.",
      "Kalko worked at the defense ministry\u2019s Academy for Military Anti-Aircraft Defense, tax records for 2021 show. Malov worked for a military unit that trains anti-aircraft missile forces, according to car ownership records for 2024.",
      "Andrei Gusev, 45, Alexander Antonov, 43, and Marat Khusainov, 54, were also booked on the April flight. Gusev is a lieutenant-colonel who works as deputy head of the faculty of General Purpose Rockets and Artillery Munitions at the defense ministry\u2019s Penza Artillery Engineering Institute, according to a 2021 news item on the institute\u2019s website.",
      "Antonov has worked at the Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate of the Defense Ministry, according to car registration records from 2024, while bank data shows Khusainov, a colonel, has worked at the Kapustin Yar missile-testing range.",
      "One of the two passengers onboard the second flight to Tehran in September was Sergei Yurchenko, 46, who has also worked at the Rocket and Artillery Directorate, according to undated mobile phone records. His passport number had the prefix \u201c22;\u201d Reuters was unable to determine what that signified though, according to the government edict on passports, it isn\u2019t used for private citizens or diplomats.",
      "The other passenger on the September flight was 46-year-old Oleg Fedosov. Residence records give his address as the office of the Directorate of Advanced Inter-Service Research and Special Projects. That is a branch of the defense ministry tasked with developing weapons systems of the future.",
      "Fedosov had previously flown from Tehran to Moscow in October 2023, according to Russian border crossing records viewed by Reuters. On that occasion, as he did for the September 2024 flight, Fedosov used his passport reserved for official state business, the records showed."
